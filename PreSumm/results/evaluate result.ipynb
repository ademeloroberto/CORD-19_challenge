      "Her pharyngeal symptoms disappeared gradually and her body temperature remained normal, without any symptoms of coughing or chest tightness. Chest CT on 22nd February showed that the lesion in the right lower lobe was smaller than before ( Figure 1C ). The patient was then discharged from the hospital on 25th February 2020. The patient and her parents had no epidemiological history in Wuhan city or Hubei province. The patient may be a third-or fourth-generation infected person, suggesting that in early February, more than three generations of SARS-CoV-2 have been transmitted in areas outside of Wuhan and Hubei. Modern transportation has made personnel movements more rapid, which might have accelerated the virus transmission speed [6] . The patient's mother had fever before her death, and her father went to two hospitals due to his fever before the diagnosis. Neither of them had the SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid test. If the patient's parents and the attending medical staff were not effectively protected at the time, further transmission may have occurred. Therefore, the vigilance of medical staff in outpatient and emergency departments around patients with fever and respiratory symptoms should be further improved and comprehensive SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid testing should be performed on such patients [7] . This is a typical case of a family cluster onset, which is common in many other cases [8] . During the epidemic period, although the father who initially developed the disease had no clear history of contact, he had stayed in multiple hospitals. Owing to the complexity of pathogen sources in hospitals, there may be potential sources of COVID-19 infection. This suggests that during the epidemic, hospital stay should be minimized. If there are feverish cases in the family, effective isolation measures should be implemented as early as possible to minimize the spread of the virus. This patient's nucleic acid test for respiratory pathogens has been negative on two consecutive occasions (sampling interval of at least 24 h). According to the Chinese 'Seventh Edition of the COVID-19 Diagnosis and Treatment Protocol' [5] , she had already met the standards of releasing from quarantine and discharging from hospital. However, a fourth subsequent respiratory tract sample showed positive SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid. Usually, nucleic acid positive rate is 80-83% [9, 10] , which suggests that in patients with a clear epidemiological history of contact with COVID-19 or suspected patients from a family cluster, the quarantine period should be appropriately extended and the nucleic acid tests should be performed repeatedly to avoid accidental discharge which may cause further virus spread. The patient's nucleic acid only became positive on the 7th day of admission. This may be because of the patient's low viral load and mild symptoms, or simply the sampling site. It is reported in the literature that taking sputum sample from a deep spot in the lung may increase the positive rate [11] . But clinically, many patients have a dry cough without any sputum, which makes it more difficult to retain sputum samples. This could be one of the reasons for the low nucleic acid positive rate. Therefore, for patients who are highly suspected for COVID-19 but with negative nucleic acid, repeated testing should be performed. In case of persistent negativity, sampling of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid should be considered. Other testing methods, such as blood IgM, second-generation sequencing may also be used to achieve confirmed diagnosis. Test results: it is reported that SARS-CoV-2 may cause a decrease in peripheral white blood cell and lymphocyte counts in the early stages of the disease [5] . But this is not the case in this patient. Some patients may have elevated liver enzymes and creatase, increased erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein. This patient had slightly increased creatase and elevated C-reactive protein, which is consistent with the report. A transient increase in serum amyloid A in this patient suggests that serum amyloid A may also be a sensitive indicator of COVID-19. For suspected cases with history of close contact with COVID-19 patients, respiratory SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid should be tested repeatedly to avoid missed diagnosis. • For suspected cases with a history of close contact with COVID-19 patients, SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid should be tested repeatedly to avoid missed diagnosis. \n",

      "This case highlights the infectivity of the virus through pre-symptomatic people. COVID-19 has globally impacted social and economic life, but the loss of life is irreplaceable and irreparable. A certain set of precautions and vigilance including hand hygiene, PPE, avoiding unnecessary travel, quarantine and self-isolation are the most critical steps in containing this pandemic illness from getting out of control. India is a nation of 1.3 billion people, densely populated, and resource constrained. If we face an outbreak of the same ferocity as China, Italy or Spain, our healthcare resources would be overrun a lot sooner. The mere thought of the consequences is petrifying. Our only saving gracewe are probably in the initial phases of the epidemic. 10, 11 Until this stage, the authorities are largely able to keep track and quarantine the cases and their contacts. But beyond this, it becomes impossible. This is our final defence, our ultimate stand. Any further, and we may reach a tipping point of our reserves. Healthcare and economic collapse would be inevitable. So, the buck stops with strict self-isolation and quarantine. The screening of passengers at International airports in India was started from 18 January 2020 12 and more than 1.5 million passengers have since arrived in India. 13 The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare along with state health authorities has made a detailed list of these passengers and have embarked on an extensive tracking of these passengers to ensure quarantine and isolation as per incubation-period recommendations. 14 The adequacy of contact tracing will be crucial determinant towards the control of this corona virus disease. However, due to high proportion of pre-symptomatic having potential to promulgate secondary and tertiary transmissions, timely contact tracing may not be feasible especially due to the known delays of reporting and laboratory test results. Thus, contact tracing may only have a supplementary role to other restrictive strategies like social distancing and avoidance of unnecessary social contact through administrative measures like lockdown.  Understanding the disease epidemiology is a first step in response preparedness. COVID-19 has a risk of unprecedented spread especially by means of pre-symptomatic transmission. Contact tracing, timely testing and adequate quarantine/isolation will go a long way in reigning the rapid spread of this disease. \n",

The purpose of this study is to give a tentative prediction of the epidemic peak for Russia, Brazil, India and Bangladesh which could become the next COVID-19 hotspots in no time by using a Trust-region-reflective (TRR) algorithm which one of the well-known real data fitting techniques. Based on the publicly available epidemiological data from late January until 10 May, it has been estimated that the number of daily new symptomatic infectious cases for the above mentioned countries could reach the peak around the beginning of June with the peak size of ∼ 15, 774 (95% CI, 12,814-16,734) symptomatic infectious cases in Russia, ∼ 26, 449 (95% CI, 25,489-31,409) cases in Brazil, ∼ 9, 504 (95% CI, 8,378-13,630) cases in India and ∼ 2, 209 (95% CI, 2,078-2,840) cases in Bangladesh. As of May 11, 2020, incorporating the infectiousness capability of asymptomatic carriers, our analysis estimates the value of the basic reproduction number (R(0)) as of May 11, 2020 was found to be ∼ 4.234 (95% CI, 3.764-4.7) in Russia, ∼ 5.347 (95% CI, 4.737-5.95) in Brazil, ∼ 5.218 (95% CI, 4.56-5.81)in India, ∼ 4.649 (95% CI, 4.17-5.12) in the United Kingdom and ∼ 3.53 (95% CI, 3.12-3.94) in Bangladesh. Moreover, Latin hypercube sampling-partial rank correlation coefficient (LHS-PRCC) which is a global sensitivity analysis (GSA) method is applied to quantify the uncertainty of our model mechanisms, which elucidates that for Russia, the recovery rate of undetected asymptomatic carriers, the rate of getting home-quarantined or self-quarantined and the transition rate from quarantined class to susceptible class are the most influential parameters, whereas the rate of getting home-quarantined or self-quarantined and the inverse of the COVID-19 incubation period are highly sensitive parameters in Brazil, India, Bangladesh and the United Kingdom which could significantly affect the transmission dynamics of the novel coronavirus. Our analysis also suggests that relaxing social distancing restrictions too quickly could exacerbate the epidemic outbreak in the above-mentioned countries.\n",

Here we argue that this undersells the potential effectiveness of the targeted quarantine approach; any government willing to take the extraordinary measure of shutting down all of society should, at the very least, consider the significantly less drastic measure of quarantining one third of their population. To the low risk population, our strategy offers a fast return to functional society, and, for those few who do get sick, access to medical facilities and staff who are dealing with a manageable number of cases. To those under isolation, targeted quarantine offers the possibility of avoiding COVID-19 altogether. By releasing a large portion of the population from lockdown after a small number of weeks, age-targeted quarantine balances the need to maintain a functional society and economy, with the limitations of hospital resources, and has the potential to significantly reduce casualties. \n",

      "There is strong interest globally amidst the current COVID-19 pandemic in tracing contacts of infectious patients using mobile technologies, both as a warning system to individuals and as a targeted intervention strategy for governments. Several governments, including India, have introduced mobile apps for this purpose, which give a warning when the individual's phone establishes bluetooth contact with the phone of an infected person. We present a methodology to probabilistically evaluate risk of infection given the network of contacts that individuals are likely to encounter in real life. Instead of binary \"infected\" or \"uninfected\" statuses, an infection risk probability is maintained which can be efficiently calculated based on probabilities of recent contacts, and updated when a recent contact is diagnosed with a disease. We demonstrate on realistic networks that this method sharply outperforms a naive immediate-contact method even in an ideal circumstance that all infected persons are known to the naive method. We demonstrate robustness to missing contact information (such as when phones fail to make bluetooth contact or the app is not installed). We show, within our model, a strong flattening of the infectious peak when even a small fraction of cases are identified, tested and isolated. In the real world, where most known-infected persons are isolated or quarantined and where many individuals may not carry their mobiles in public, we believe the improvement offered by our method warrants consideration. Importantly, in view of widespread concerns on privacy and contact-tracing, our method relies mainly on direct contact data that can be stored locally on users' phones, and uses limited communication via intermediary servers only upon testing, mitigating privacy concerns.\n",

      "The rapid expansion of COVID-19 has caused a global pandemic. Although quarantine measures have been used widely, the critical steps among them to suppress the outbreak without a huge social-economic loss remain unknown. Hong Kong, unlike other regions in the world, had a massive number of travellers from Mainland China during the early expansion period, and yet the spread of virus has been relatively limited. Understanding the effect of control measures to reduce the transmission in Hong Kong can improve the control of the virus spreading. We have developed a susceptible-exposed-infectious-quarantined-recovered (SEIQR) meta-population model that can stratify the infections into imported and subsequent local infections, and therefore to obtain the control effects on transmissibility in a region with many imported cases. We fitted the model to both imported and local confirmed cases with symptom onset from 18 January to 29 February 2020 in Hong Kong with daily transportation data and the transmission dynamics from Wuhan and Mainland China. The model estimated that the reproductive number was dropped from 2.32 to 0.76 (95% CI, 0.66 to 0.86) after an infected case was estimated to be quarantined half day before the symptom onset, corresponding to the incubation time of 5.43 days (95% CI, 1.30-9.47). If the quarantine happened about one day after the onset, community spread would be likely to occur, indicated by the reproductive number larger than one. The results suggest that the early quarantine for a suspected case before the symptom onset is a key factor to suppress COVID-19.\n",

If we expect the Italian people to remain inside and keep following the recommendations of public health officials for the next few weeks or even months (as may be necessary to curb the spread of COVID-19) it would be helpful to find ways of reducing these negative effects of the quarantine. A messaging campaign that suggests how to make the quarantine easier and more frictionless, rather than repeating the now well-known dire reasons to stay indoors, should begin. Possibilities include messaging about online collective exercises, social reading activities (e.g., Perusall.com for schools and universities), safe ways for people to get fresh air outside, classes (e.g., edx.org for online classes), or novel ways of bridging social capital between young and old, or even distribution of inexpensive tablets or laptops to ensure the whole population has video conferencing abilities. If we look for activities and interventions that make the quarantine easier for those affected by it, the population may be able to better tolerate the treatment for as long as it takes to overcome this public health crisis. respondent of an intensely personal impact of non-compliance with the quarantine. The message was as follows: \"If you are infected with COVID-19, you are likely to infect your parents, your friends' parents, and/or one any one of your close ones. If they are older than 50, they may die. In the text field below, please name a loved one (example: my father, my grandmother) that you're most worried about contracting COVID-19.\" The third group received no message, as a control condition for comparison. In a pre-test, the social externalities messaging outperformed most other messages framing the risks of noncompliance with safety measures -including messages framed around pro-sociality, expert or celebrity advice, and healthcare sector externalities (i.e. \"flatten the curve\"). The survey proceeded by then asking respondents for their beliefs, social perceptions, and perceived efficacy about government and/or public safety measures. Respondents were also asked about their trust in government and the degree to which the government was providing factual information about the crisis. We asked respondents a series of questions about anxiety, stress, and worry around the current circumstances. Next, respondents were asked about their future behaviors -namely whether they planned to leave the house in the next 5 days, and their top reasons for leaving, as well as negative aspects of complying with staying at home. Finally, respondents took a brief personality battery, provided personal demographic information, and were asked whether they would share either the social externalities message or some other message of their choosing with upto 5 of their friends or loved ones via text or email. \n",

With a proactive thinking, the authorities could design sets of regulations with different levels of strictness: in situations like epidemics, more lenient regulations could take force and let the drone operations rise to higher levels than during nominal course of events --the switch may be justified not only by the extreme social value of the drones use (as shown here), but also by the fact that during the (even partial) quarantine there are fewer people on the streets, which lowers the ground risk of drone operations (one of the concerns for the regulators [AHH19, BNEK+17, BNAB+17, DPJ18, PRC20, WCS17]). We emphasize that our model of mass-testing can be applied at any geographic scale. In particular, while the epidemic is confined to a limited area, it may be reasonable to concentrate on mass-testing only the potentially affected region. As far as our theoretical results (SIQR) are concerned, incorporating people on quarantine into epidemic spread modeling may not only provide more accurate prediction of the disease spread, but also help understand the economic consequences of the quarantine (see [T20] for discussion of COVID-19 economic impact). \n",

Overall, these findings suggest that aggressive contact-tracing strategies based on suspect cases may be appropriate early in an outbreak but as it progresses, control measures should transition to a combination of approaches that account for setting-specific transmission risk. Quarantine may need to cover entire communities such as dormitories, workplaces, or other institutional and residential settings, while contact tracing should shift to identifying hotspots of transmission and vulnerable populations. The variability in SAR across settings suggests targeted strategies may allow for reducing infections while not overly restricting social movement. . CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0    . CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0    \n",

      "The outbreak of the novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) has lead countries worldwide to administer quarantine policies. However, each country or state decides independently what mobility restrictions to administer within its borders, while aiming to maximize its own citizens' welfare. In turn, since individuals travel between countries and states, at least during periods when quarantines are less restrictive, the policy in one country may ultimately affect the infection level in other countries. Therefore, major questions are whether the policy dictated by a decentralized government is efficient, and if not, how the governments can coordinate a better policy. Here, we focus on the decision regarding the timing of releasing the quarantines. We consider a game theory model in which each of two governments decides when to switch from a restrictive to a non-restrictive quarantine and vice versa. We used parameter values driven by the literature and publically available data. We show that, if travel is sufficiently frequent during the non-restrictive quarantine periods, then the strategies are sub-optimal: Each governor tends to release the quarantine sooner, which ultimately leads to longer periods of restrictive quarantines and a higher prevalence of the disease. In turn, if the governments restrict international and interstate travel to a low level even when the quarantines are non-restrictive, the policy dictated by the decentralized governance may become optimal.\n",

Our estimates of R0 for the initial period (Table 1 ) are all greater than 3, consistent with most estimates of R0 reported earlier [22, 23] , showing that the COVID-19 virus is highly transmissible. Our results show that with a serial interval of 6 days, R0 is similar for t = 1-3, yet R0 for some passengers is slightly higher for t = 4, while R0 finally decreases for t = 5. This demonstrates the possibility that as long as asymptomatic positive cases were not removed, R0 remains high under quarantine conditions. We find evidence to support a CDC report that \"a high proportion of asymptomatic infections could partially explain the high attack rate among cruise ship passengers and crew.\" The effects of pre/asymptomatic population on the spread of COVID-19 during quarantine has not yet been studied extensively. Clinical observations and lab tests have confirmed the existence of a pre/asymptomatic population infecting others [6, 7, 8] . It is not easy to give precise estimates of the size of this population, yet the DP outbreak provides very useful real world data for this. 46.5% of passengers and crew members on the DP were asymptomatic at the time of testing [14] , and about 17.9% of the infected individuals never demonstrated any symptoms [13] . Some research has suggested that the pre/asymptomatic population, \"silent carriers,\" are the main driving force behind this pandemic.

These interactions form the basis of person-to-person virus transmission. Every day was built as a computational block connected to other layers through the silent carriers coming out of the block. Each day comprises of many layers of computation blocks. A complex network of the virus spread was built block-by-block and layer-by-layer. The multiple layers were integrated to give a complete system view. All parameters have physical significance in the real world. . CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0    ()  . . 12.20099291  The MIMANSA simulator has four controls. They are the virus exposure control, the infection rate control, the lockdown control, and the quarantine control. Besides these, there is complete flexibility in changing other parameters, if there is empirical evidence. In this paper, we have shown the models' effectiveness in simulating COVID-19. However, MIMANSA is an inherently generic model to simulate the virus spread. It is flexible and can be easily adapted to other spread of viruses. MIMANSA was trained using COIVD-19 case data from India. Once trained, it has been able to track the number of patient cases within 5% error margin. However, the objective of MIMNASA is not only predicting the cases but to help make complex decisions with ease. MIMANSA allows one to simulate various percentages of lockdown, assess the effectiveness of masks usage, contact tracing, and quarantine. One can run multiple scenarios with varying levels of each of the parameters to find out a trade-off between a high number of patients with a minimal impact on the economy vs. a low number of cases with a high impact on the economy. With the help of MIMANSA, our current research aims at finding the balance between the effect of strict lockdown on the economy vs. the marginally high number of COVID-19 patients with a bit relaxed lockdown. \n"

      "In this paper, a new Susceptible-Exposed-Symptomatic Infectious-Asymptomatic Infectious-Quarantined-Hospitalized-Recovered-Dead (SEI(D)I(U)QHRD) deterministic compartmental model has been proposed and calibrated for interpreting the transmission dynamics of the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19). The purpose of this study is to give a tentative prediction of the epidemic peak for Russia, Brazil, India and Bangladesh which could become the next COVID-19 hotspots in no time by using a Trust-region-reflective (TRR) algorithm which one of the well-known real data fitting techniques. Based on the publicly available epidemiological data from late January until 10 May, it has been estimated that the number of daily new symptomatic infectious cases for the above mentioned countries could reach the peak around the beginning of June with the peak size of ∼ 15, 774 (95% CI, 12,814-16,734) symptomatic infectious cases in Russia, ∼ 26, 449 (95% CI, 25,489-31,409) cases in Brazil, ∼ 9, 504 (95% CI, 8,378-13,630) cases in India and ∼ 2, 209 (95% CI, 2,078-2,840) cases in Bangladesh. As of May 11, 2020, incorporating the infectiousness capability of asymptomatic carriers, our analysis estimates the value of the basic reproduction number (R(0)) as of May 11, 2020 was found to be ∼ 4.234 (95% CI, 3.764-4.7) in Russia, ∼ 5.347 (95% CI, 4.737-5.95) in Brazil, ∼ 5.218 (95% CI, 4.56-5.81)in India, ∼ 4.649 (95% CI, 4.17-5.12) in the United Kingdom and ∼ 3.53 (95% CI, 3.12-3.94) in Bangladesh. Moreover, Latin hypercube sampling-partial rank correlation coefficient (LHS-PRCC) which is a global sensitivity analysis (GSA) method is applied to quantify the uncertainty of our model mechanisms, which elucidates that for Russia, the recovery rate of undetected asymptomatic carriers, the rate of getting home-quarantined or self-quarantined and the transition rate from quarantined class to susceptible class are the most influential parameters, whereas the rate of getting home-quarantined or self-quarantined and the inverse of the COVID-19 incubation period are highly sensitive parameters in Brazil, India, Bangladesh and the United Kingdom which could significantly affect the transmission dynamics of the novel coronavirus. Our analysis also suggests that relaxing social distancing restrictions too quickly could exacerbate the epidemic outbreak in the above-mentioned countries.\n"

      "The spread of the novel coronavirus is characterized by two phases: (I) a natural exponential growth phase that occurs in the absence of intervention and (II) a regulated growth phase that is affected by enforcing social distancing and isolation. We have developed a fundamental spreading model for the COVID-19 epidemic that has two parameters: the community transmission rate and a metric describing the degree of isolation and social distancing in a given community or region (country, state, county, or city). These two parameters are calibrated to data from the community, so the model uncertainty depends on the quality of the data and ability to test for COVID-19. The model shows that social distancing significantly reduces the epidemic spread and flattens the curve. The model predicts well the spreading trajectory and peak time of new infections for a community of any size and provides an upper estimate for the total number of infections and daily new infection rate for weeks into the future, providing the vital information and lead time needed to prepare for and mitigate the epidemic.

      "Finally, we consider a distributed lag model specification to empirically test whether changes in mobility weeks prior have an effect on current health outcomes from COVID-19. Across models we control for day-to-day changes common to all states and statespecific factors affecting health outcomes, state-specific trends affecting health outcomes, and distinguish between mandate and non-mandate states. We model daily new COVID 19 deaths and hospitalizations per 100 million residents by state as Where H sd is the daily health outcome reported for state s on date d, andṀ OB s,−k is the lagged change in the chosen mobility measure (one of average distance traveled, ADT , non-essential visitsṄ EV , or human encountersĖN C). k ∈ {1, 2, 3} so that 26 . CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0    Our estimates are an average of the effects of behavioral changes that occurred early in the COVID-19 pandemic as well as after states began implementing health policies. We estimate significant cumulative long-term effects of lagged mobility on current deaths, which provides preliminary evidence that the behavioral changes of reductions in mobility do contribute to flattening the health outcome curves weeks later. Specifically, we estimate that a one percent reduction in non-essential travel three weeks earlier has a significant long-term correlation of reducing deaths by 9.2 per 100 million each day. Given that residents across the U.S. averaged a decline of 40 percentage points in non-essential visits relative to baseline levels in the months of March and April, this would correspond to an estimated 360 (40 × 9) fewer daily deaths per 100 million residents. Using the estimated mandate-induced changes in non-essential visits of -4 percentage points from the weighted event study analyses, this is 10% of the overall reductions during this period and corresponds to a decline of 36 deaths per day due to mandate-induced behavior changes. We estimate a differential impact in mandate states which provides preliminary evidence that mandate policies convey long-term health impacts. Further, we estimate a differential impact in mandate states, providing preliminary evidence that stay-at-home mandates may convey positive cumulative long-term health impacts. Specifically, we estimate that a one percent reduction in average distance traveled three weeks earlier is significantly associated with 70 fewer deaths per 100 million per day. Given that on average residents across the U.S. CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0    Temporarily closing non-essential businesses and mandating residents stay at home except for essential activity is the prime policy instrument currently employed by states to promote social distancing and slow the transmission of COVID-19. If effective, these policies will have reduced strain on the medical system and provided much-needed time for the development of pharmaceutical treatments that can reduce transmission rates and end the pandemic. If unsuccessful, states will have incurred large economic costs with few lives saved. Whether these mandates cause people to stay at home and engage in social distancing is a key requirement of a successful policy. Knowing whether such policies will have their intended effect is of increasing policy relevance as all but eight states eventually adopted such policies. Understanding if and how individuals reduce travel activity in response to stay-at-home mandates and maintain social distance is the primary empirical question we tackle in this paper. First, we find that by the time the average adopter has implemented its statewide mandate, residents had already reduced travel by considerable amounts relative to pre-COVID-19 levels. Average travel distances had already fallen by 38 percentage points, human encounter rates by 76 percentage points, and non-essential visits by 52 percentage points before the first statewide mandate came into effect, providing evidence of extensive social distancing occurring even before they were required by statewide orders. Second, we find evidence that adoption of state-level stay-at-home mandates induced further reductions in all three travel activity measures. The mandate effect persists not just for the early adoption states (where residents' travel activity had not yet stabilized at new, lower norms) but also for mandates adopted weeks later. For the 63 . CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0    ()  .   early mandate states of California, Illinois, New Jersey, and New York, our staggered difference-in-differences models estimate a reduction in average distance traveled of 4.1 percentage points, a decline in visits to non-essential businesses of 5.2 percentage points, and a decrease in the rate of unique human encounters of 4.7 percentage points relative to pre-COVID-19 baselines. These effects remain present when considering all mandates implemented, albeit to a slightly smaller degree, with mandate ATT estimates of a −2.8 change in distance traveled, −4.5 change in non-essential visits, and a −3.6 change in unique human encounters. Estimated magnitudes remain highly comparable when directly accounting in differences in pre-mandate behavior for treatment and control states. Through the weighted event studies that construct control units to balance pre-treatment travel behavior net of state fixed effects, we find large, statistically significant drops immediately following mandate implementation that persist for the duration of the sample period. Resulting estimates of the overall mandate effects range between -7.29 and -6.47 for changes in average distance traveled, between -4.38 and -4.14 for non-essential visits, and between -5.87 and -4.98 for any mix of pooled and separate synthetic control weights. Our estimates suggest that, importantly, residents subject to stay-at-home mandates are on average responding as desired to curb the spread of COVID-19. Our empirical approaches isolate the mandate effect from other drivers of daily changes in travel activity levels, state-specific trends, and controls for a host of potential confounding factors that differ between states that adopted early policies relative to other states. In spite of these rigorous control approaches, we find persistent evidence of state mandates inducing further reductions in travel activity even after considerable earlier declines around the country. Further, our estimates are average treatment ef-64 .

Linking changes in travel activity and social distancing to health outcomes, we find evidence that these reductions help \"flatten the curve\" and reduce health consequences. We find that, on average, a one percentage point decrease in non-essential visits per day three weeks prior has a long-term average effect of reducing nationwide death rates by 0.92 fewer deaths per million per day. Converting these reductions in deaths to economic benefits, we find that the observed reduced travel activity nationwide during the months of March and April translate into savings of $249-$755 billion due to associated reductions in deaths. Further, we find evidence of differential declines in deaths from shorter distances traveled in the first four states to adopt statewide mandates. Residents of these state were subject to modified business policies and face covering requirements for greater periods of time; our findings provide preliminary evidence that the non-pharmaceutical interventions employed by statewide mandates helped further flatten these states' epidemic curves. The reductions in deaths from a month-long mandate in these states are associated with total savings between $23.1 and $99.1 billion. Our findings have important policy implications for the fight against COVID-19. First, individuals on average responded as intended to statewide mandates. Despite considerable prior reductions, residents heeded their states' requests and stayed at home. Second, the declines in economic activity directly attributable to statewide 65 . CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0    ()  .   mandates may be much smaller than previously thought. As individuals around the country had already more than halved the quantity of trips taken to non-essential retail and service businesses, much of the lost business and resulting unemployment would have likely still occurred even if states had not adopted their stay-at-home policies. Further, as the mandate-induced reductions in visits to non-essential businesses amount to only one-tenth of the overall reductions since COVID-19, it is likely that loosening or removing statewide policies on their own will not be sufficient to induce mobility patterns to quickly return to pre-COVID-19 levels. Further policies will be needed to ensure that individuals can resume activity and return to local businesses in a manner that is safe. Our estimates do not take into account the benefits from avoided hospitalizations and other indirect health benefits from reduced travel activity and social distancing. As reductions in travel distance and increased social distance likely decrease exposure to other potentially deadly illnesses, this is likely an underestimation of the overall health benefit of these policies. Further, the patterns in under-reporting and undercounting of COVID-19 deaths provide further evidence that we likely underestimate the direct benefits of these policies. Future identification of additional COVID-19 deaths may prove difficult, as many death certificates list only the immediate cause of death and fail to report underlying diseases -likely understating the presence of COVID-19 [40] . Further, procedures for counting COVID-19 deaths may be correlated with adoption of stay-at-home mandates. If adoption of a state-level ordinance indicates additional preparedness on the part of the adopting state, then states that were slower to (or had yet to) pass stay-at-home mandates may also have been slower to properly attribute deaths to COVID-19, resulting in our estimated effects being under-66 .

As a result it may not ever be possible to determine the exact loss of life due to COVID-19, and accordingly we heed caution in interpreting our result as capturing a de-facto relationship. We support continued efforts to obtain accurate counts of the mortality and morbidity consequences from COVID-19 to help ensure future research can provide sufficient policy guidance in the case of future pandemics. While this paper sets out to understand an important and timely question and provides benefit estimates to help policymakers evaluate tradeoffs and weigh the costs and benefits of extending and relaxing such policies, there are avenues for future research that could be explored. First, whether these policies result in a true flattening of the epidemic curve or merely postpone illness is an avenue that deserves additional attention. Particularly as states weigh the difficult decisions of reopening business as usual, it is necessary to understand how caseloads and health consequences may rebound. Second, future work should also consider within-state policy variation and the relationship between local and national policies. Knowing whether county-level mandates that preceded statewide policies conveyed additional benefits will help improve our understanding of the full set of policy tools available to combat future pandemics. Further, the economic forces and psychological incentives behind compliance with stay-at-home mandates are complex, and additional work is needed that can characterize the mechanisms behind the policy effects we observe. \n",

      "After weeks under lockdown, metropolitan areas fighting the spread of COVID-19 aim to balance public health goals with social and economic standards for well-being. Mathematical models of disease transmission seeking to evaluate mitigation strategies must assess the possible impacts of social distancing, economic lockdowns and other measures. However, obscure relations between model parameters and real-world phenomena complicate such analyses. Here, we use a high-resolution metapopulation model of Guadalajara (GDL, Western Mexico) to represent daily mobility patterns driven by economic activities and their relation to epidemic growth. Given the prominence of essential activities in the city's economy, we find that strategies aiming to mitigate the risk of out-of-home interactions are insufficient to stop the catastrophic spread of COVID-19. Using baseline reproduction numbers R0 = [2.5, 3.0] in the absence of interventions, our simulations suggest that household transmission alone can make Rt ~ 1, and is estimated to drive 70 {+/-} 15% of current epidemic growth. This sets an upper bound for the impact of mobility-based interventions, which are unlikely to lower Rt below 1.3 and must be complemented with aggressive campaigns for early case detection and isolation. As laboratory testing and health services become insufficient to meet demand in GDL and most other cities, we propose that cities facilitate guidelines and equipment to help people curb spreading within their own homes. Postponing these actions will increase their economic cost and decrease their potential returns.\n",

      "In this work, the dynamics of COVID-19 spread in India from the beginning until June 8, 2020 are analyzed. Different mathematical models are used to describe the initial rapid growth (phase-1), slow growth immediately after lockdown (phase-2), and later and more recent fast growth (phase-3). It is shown that exponential, linear and quadratic curves define these phases with high statistical significance. The switch from linear to quadratic growth after lockdown is suspected to be related to the order-of-magnitude increase in the diagnostic testing capacity. However, an increase in the positivity rate nearly 1.5 months after the lockdown, inconsistent with what is observed for other countries, indicates that the testing capacity may still not be adequate. Future projections based on available data are made using both phenomenological and mechanistic models. These models have high variability in the prediction of the peak, and even the most optimistic case projects the flattening of the curve in September. The accuracies of these predictions are also limited in the absence of an accurate estimate of the true number of cases due to insufficient testing capacity. Therefore, these models should be regularly revisited, as more and more reliable estimates of the infections become available with 6 . CC-BY-ND 4.0    increasing testing capacity.

      "Background The government of India implemented social distancing interventions to contain the COVID-19 epidemic. However, effects on epidemic dynamics are yet to be understood. Methods Rates of laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 infections per day and effective reproduction number (Rt) were estimated for 4 periods (Pre-lockdown and Lockdown Phases 1 to 3) according to nationally implemented phased interventions. Adoption of these interventions was estimated using Google mobility data. Estimates at the national level and for 12 Indian states most affected by COVID-19 are presented. Findings Daily case rates ranged from 0.03 to 30.05/10 million people across 4 discrete periods in India. From May 4-17, 2020, the National Capital Territory (NCT) of Delhi had the highest case rate (222/10 million people/day), whereas Kerala had the lowest (2.18/10 million/day). Average Rt was 1.99 (95% CI 1.93-2.06) for India; it ranged from 1.38 to 2.78, decreasing over time. Median mobility in India decreased in all contact domains, with the lowest being 21% in retail/recreation (95% CI 13-46%), except home which increased to 129% (95% CI 117-132%) compared to the 100% baseline value. Interpretation The Indian government imposed strict contact mitigation, followed by a phased relaxation, which slowed the spread of COVID-19 epidemic progression in India. The identified daily COVID-19 case rates and Rt will aid national and state governments in formulating ongoing COVID-19 containment plans. Furthermore, these findings may inform COVID-19 public health policy in developing countries with similar settings to India. Funding Non-funded.\n",

This way, we did not make a priori assumptions on consistency across countries and delays in the effect of governmental interventions. Our findings show that change points in the daily ECRs overlap with moments of governmental interventions. Overall, the first set of measures taken by the governments seems to have an immediate (although heterogeneous) effect. This first set of measures typically included the closure of schools and daycares, as well as banning events. Implementing a full lockdown after the first set of measures, either locally or nationally, seemed to coincide with changes in the ECR, but in several countries only when this was enforced with increased police surveillance. Although the effect of closing schools and banning events has been demonstrated in previous studies 1,4 , our findings suggested a stronger (combined) effect of the first set of measures than found before. On the contrary, these studies observed more serious effects of a gathering bans, lockdowns, and closure of bars and restaurants 1,4 . These differences may be explained by the additional model restrictions (constant contact rates, country homogeneous effect sizes, and fixed delay in the effects) that these studies implemented. Therefore, they could not determine whether the effect of the full lockdown did change over time as we observed.

      "The approach of a second phase of the pandemic into a new normality is full of uncertainties from the point of view of social and economic planning. It is clear to the people that this period cannot be marked by an \"all free\", by a return to the old normality. For some time to come it will be necessary to respect rules of conduct and hygiene standards to which we have not been accustomed. There are many issues to be addressed, in particular how gradually to reopen the various social and economic activities without creating a new wave of infected and therefore deaths. In order to analyze possible future scenarios, it is essential to have models capable of describing the impact of the epidemic according to the specific social characteristics of the country and the containment actions implemented. In this work, aware of the complexity of the problem, we have tried to provide a suitable modeling context to describe possible future scenarios in this direction. The use of a SIR model with social structure modified through appropriate feedback controls allows to obtain simulations in agreement with the current epidemic scenarios in different countries, including Germany, France, Italy, Spain, the United Kingdom and the United States. The inclusion of uncertainty about the actual value of the number of infected people makes it possible to analyze the effects of the potential reopening of productive and social activities at different times. A multi-modelling approach aligned with the current epidemiological and demographic data, which includes experimental social interaction matrices for the different countries, permits to contextualize possible future scenarios. Further studies are being conducted on geographical dependence through spatial variables. This would make it possible to characterize control measures on a local rather than global basis. .

      "The COVID-19 pandemic revealed an exponential rise in the reported number of cases and affected the public health ranging from mild to severe conditions. Countries across the world are combating the spread of the coronavirus through various social distancing/intervention measures such as closure of schools and universities, banning of public events and large gatherings, isolation of symptomatic COVID-19 cases, mass quarantines etc. For national as well as international control of public health, it is crucial to understand the significance of the onset timing of such measures [29] . The World Health Organisation lately reports new cases being reported into several new countries across the globe [30] [31] [32] . Our study can provide an insight to tackle the ongoing pandemic and its associated growth curve in the context of the timing and strength of the interventions. We use the data of the number of COVID-19 cases in nine different countries to investigate some statistical patterns in the growth curves. The number of cases covers a small fraction of the population during the initiation of the epidemic, and the fraction remains nearly stagnant for around 20 days from the arrival of the first case. After the threshold of around 20 days, the number of cases starts increasing rapidly, and in a relatively shorter span a significant fraction of the population can be affected. This trend is analogous to the idea that the growth curve remains close to one stable state for sufficient time and, crossing a time threshold invokes a sudden shift/transition to another stable state, where a significant fraction of the population gets affected. In our work, we employ statistical indicators of critical slowing down to check if such transitions can be signaled beforehand and how the anticipation of such transitions can help mitigate such crisis at a policy level. We observe that the 35-40 days window from the arrival of the first case in each country signaled an impending transition. In the vicinity of 35-40 days, an increase in the short term memory (at lag 1) of the data as well as a decrease in the return rate indicates the phenomenon of critical slowing down. Our work suggests that while non-pharmaceutical interventions are necessary to mitigate such epidemic, the timing of initiation of concerned actions can strongly influence the outcome of the situation. Owing to the time lag in the detection of symptomatic cases, the statistical indicators suggest that the initial 20-25 days being crucial to suppress the loss of public health. The controlled response of the epidemic growth curve for China and South Korea can be associated with the time distance between implementation of interventions and the transition point. Thus, EWSs analyses is crucial while defining the onset of the interventions and suppress the rise of daily cases. Importantly, another crucial aspect is the proportion of affected cases in each country, i.e., a measure of the fraction of the country's population, and not the absolute numbers, which is infected at the time of interventions such as a strict lockdown. As probability of the propagation of disease can be thought of as mostly similar or equal amongst individuals across the globe, it depends upon the fraction of infected cases in each country during the beginning of interventions. For instance, a decrease in the return rate and increased autocorrelation anticipated the upcoming rise in the growth curves for both India as well as Italy, and interestingly, both the countries imposed individual nationwide lockdown near the situation close to the transition (Table I) . However, the control in India depicts better results in altering the growth curve than that in Italy. The alterations in the growth curve is most likely to be a consequence of a difference in the proportion of cases affected by the epidemic at the beginning of mitigation strategies. India resembling China in terms of the total population density accounted for approximately 2.36 × 10 −7 cases of the total population, while Italy with relatively less population density crossed 1.22 × 10 −4 cases of their total population. Thus, even with imposition of the public health measures near the signals of CSD, the outcome for both the countries can dramatically vary. Furthermore, the disruptive situation in the US is indicated by EWSs, as the EWSs indicators were visible quite early for the US. Thus, sharp rise in the number of cases for the country is a consequence of both the delay in effective social distancing interventions . CC-BY-NC 4.0   author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity. is the (which was not peer-reviewed)    as well as a large proportion of affected cases at that time. Overall, our work suggests that in almost all the countries, a sharp upcoming rise in the growth curve can be captured using statistical measures, before the actual transition. Another horizon the infectious coronavirus put forwards is on the quality of air pollution in countries where social distancing/lockdown is enforced. NO 2 , which is majorly emitted from anthropogenic activities like land transportation, industries, and energy sectors, was estimated to decrease in consequence of lockdown measures implemented by the government of respective countries. Population weighted average column NO 2 was found to decrease with amplification in a number of cases across most of the countries. Apart from this, NO 2 column quantities may be used as a proxy to estimate the effectiveness of a lockdown on air quality. We find that NO 2 column quantities started following a decreasing trend during the last week of February in Italy and US which indicate a partial unofficial closure of anthropogenic activities, taking into consideration that the official COVID-19 induced lockdown was enforced on 09 March and around 25 March in Italy and the US, respectively. Whereas, in the UK, an increasing trend in NO 2 column till the last week of March indicates no such public awareness to restrict anthropogenic activities (the government declared the lockdown from 23 March). We acknowledge that the reduction in NO 2 is also associated with the compliance of the population of the individual nation to abide by the lockdown measures. Furthermore, we suggest that the interventions employed by India may not be at the time when the curve is very far from reaching the transition; however, the smaller proportion of affected cases may be the determining factor in limiting the disease spread in India. Implementation of a nationwide lockdown in India may have better prepared the country for taking measures to control the epidemic spread and bend the curve. However, our analyses also suggest that the period beyond the signals of CSD also needs efficient monitoring. The result of our minimal stochastic model predicts that on 15 April, the number of infected people can go up to approximately 13500. Thus, the extended period of such measures are needed and likely to be effective [5] . We envision that it is fundamental to identify the situation of such a crisis across the world and make use of the lead time. The EWSs can keep track of the changes in the trend statistics in the number of reported cases and warn when a threshold is reached. The statistical tools used can be beneficial to identify whether the features of shift in a system are suppressed by the intervention strategies being adopted. In particular, while different combinations of strategies are adopted to overcome such crisis, the information of an upcoming transition and its threshold is important to formulate the degree of such interventions. However, special care should be taken in the choice of rolling window size and the filtering bandwidth while estimating the signals of slowing down. Inappro-priate choices may give weak and/or diminish the signals of an imminent transition, which may deviate from understanding the urgency of the situation. Another aspect to consider is that the varying extent of testing for COVID-19 across the countries may have affected the total number of reported cases; thus, our results here hold specifically for the number of reported cases. \n",

Results show a super-linear scaling between intensity (percent contact reduction) and required duration of application to have an added value (lower fatality rate). This holds true for an effective reproduction of R > 1 and is reverted for R < 1. If R is not reduced below 1, secondary effects of required long-term isolation are likely to unravel the added value of disease mitigation. We recommend an extinction strategy implemented by intense countermeasures.\n",

      "As can be seen from Figure 2 , the simulations displayed above correlate well with data found in the biomedical literature. As seen in Figure 3 , the number of deaths in Italy and the United Kingdom correlate well with the predicted deaths. The number of recorded cases also conform well with the simulation, however they may be slightly higher due to the larger number of people getting tested than actually being hospitalised. All in all, it is clearly seen that the simulation overall reflects the available data well. Now, looking at the simulations for the UK, we can explore the different outcomes for the different approaches taken. If, like Sweden, the UK were to take the route of relying on herd immunity, as seen in Figure 4 , almost all of the population becomes immune (with the exception of the 1.3% of the population that die). The length of time that this will take is just over three months as seen in the graphs. So, the result of this approach would be a relatively fast outcome with a large percentage of people immune, but with the downside of having an estimated 800,000 mortalities. However, the UK has not taken this approach and has instead decided to adopt a social distancing approach and go on lockdown. If UK's lockdown goes perfectly (as shown in Figure 5 ), the pandemic will be resolved in roughly 1.5 months with only 21, 000 dead. However, seeing as UK is only going on a semi-lockdown (with e.g. many people still going to work and using public transportation), the likelihood of this seems very low. It seems much more likely that the result of this semi-lockdown looks more like Figure 6 , with 4.5 months of ng this semi-lockdown and with approximately 80, 000 dead. We can also see what happens if the lockdown is even more relaxed, with people going out at times that aren't completely necessary because people start to grow bored. If people do start to take this lockdown less seriously -especially young people who believe that they will not get gravely ill due to their youth -it might result in things looking more like Figure 7 , with the 'lockdown' taking over 6+ months and resulting in more than 300, 000 fatalities. This reflects just how important it is to stay at home; the more relaxed we become the longer this is going to take with more deaths occurring, which is what no one wants. To conclude on the simulations, we can see that the less seriously lockdown is taken, or the less strict we are about this lockdown, the longer this will take. If this lockdown isn't done to a high enough standard, it is evident that this will take much longer, with the results not looking too different to 8 . CC-BY 4.0    \n",

      "To curb the spread of the novel coronavirus, India announced a nationwide lockdown on 24th March 2020 for 21 days, later extended for a longer time. This long period of lockdown greatly disrupted routine life and likely affecting citizens psychological well-being. The psychological toll of the pandemic on Indians is documented. However, no study has assessed whether the psychological toll changed over time due to repeated extensions of the lockdown. We followed up 159 Indian adults during the first two months of the lockdown to assess any change in their anxiety, stress, and depressive symptoms. Multilevel linear regression models of repeated observations nested within individuals, adjusted for socio-demographic covariates, showed that anxiety ({beta}=0.81, CI: 0.03, 1.60), stress ({beta}=0.51, CI: 0.32, 0.70), and depressive symptoms ({beta}=0.37, CI: 0.13, 0.60) increased over time during the lockdown. This increase was higher among women than men independent of covariates. Individual resilience was negatively associated with the psychological outcomes. This suggests that the state needs to address the current mental health impacts of a long-drawn out lockdown and its long-term sequelae. Disproportionate burden on women needs immediate attention. Sustainable change requires addressing the root causes driving the gender inequalities in psychological distress during such crises.\n"
