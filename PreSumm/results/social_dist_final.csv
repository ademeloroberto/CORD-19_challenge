23709,"This paper provides a timely estimation of the economic impact of the coronavirus, both at the local and global levels. To keep the exercise simple and transparent, we have to abstract from several aspects of the epidemic, and hence we do not claim that this is the most comprehensive calculation. We mostly want to highlight the network nature of the economic impact. With more closely connected production network within mainland China and trade network across countries, we show that the coronavirus has a non-negligible effect on output. "
24201,"As the largest quarantine in human history, the City of Wuhan, China, with more than 11 million people went under a complete lockdown situation on 23 Jan 2020. An unprecedented situation that lasted longer than ever imagined. This occurred solely due to the spread of the novel coronavirus disease (later renamed as “COVID-19”), just one day before the celebration of the Chinese New Year."
64298,"We investigated the relation between PCR examination rate among population and the success of containment of COVID-19. Although there was moderate negative correlation, the effect cannot be separated from that of Gross Domestic Product per capita (GDP), which may well be related to the strict compliance to social distancing. Close inspection of individual countries suggested that the social distancing is the largest factor to achieve containment, and the contribution of broad PCR tests is smaller."
64299,"The results of our study forecast the possible course of the pandemic in the National Capital Region of Delhi and the likely effect of various public health interventions considered by the Government of India and the Government of Delhi. Accordingly estimates shows that pandemic may reach its peak on 94 th day with around 55 lakh prevalent cases on peak day, if no public health interventions implemented. By case isolation and lockdown we could delay . CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0    "
64331,"Aiming at a balance of infections, deaths and economic loss, we simulated and evaluated how and when to take which intensity level of interventions was a feasible way to control the COVID-19 outbreak in the UK. We found rolling intervention between suppression and mitigation with high intensity could be an effective and efficient choice to limit the total deaths of the UK to 33-38 thousand but maintain essential mobility for avoiding huge economic lose and society anxiety in a long period. Fig.1 . Therefore, we concluded that taking rolling intervention was more suitable to the UK. Notably, the total infections estimated in our model was measured by Exposed population (asymptomatic), which might be largely greater than other works only estimating Infectious population (symptomatic). We found that a large portion of self-recovered population were asymptomatic or mild symptomatic in the COVID-19 breakouts in Wuhan (occupied about 42%-60% of the total infectious population). These people might think they had been healthy at home because they did not go to hospital for COVID-19 tests. It was one important issue that some SEIR model predicted infectious population in Wuhan that 10 times over than confirmed cases. 12 Our results show that taking rolling intervention is one optimal strategy to effectively and efficiently control COVID-19 outbreaks in the UK. This strategy potentially reduces the overall infections and deaths; delays and reduces peak healthcare demand. In future, our model will be extended to investigate how to optimise the timing and strength of intervention to reduce COVID-19 morality and specific healthcare demand. "
64356,"To curb the spread of the novel coronavirus, India announced a nationwide lockdown on 24th March 2020 for 21 days, later extended for a longer time. This long period of lockdown greatly disrupted routine life and likely affecting citizens psychological well-being. The psychological toll of the pandemic on Indians is documented. However, no study has assessed whether the psychological toll changed over time due to repeated extensions of the lockdown. We followed up 159 Indian adults during the first two months of the lockdown to assess any change in their anxiety, stress, and depressive symptoms. Multilevel linear regression models of repeated observations nested within individuals, adjusted for socio-demographic covariates, showed that anxiety ({beta}=0.81, CI: 0.03, 1.60), stress ({beta}=0.51, CI: 0.32, 0.70), and depressive symptoms ({beta}=0.37, CI: 0.13, 0.60) increased over time during the lockdown. This increase was higher among women than men independent of covariates. Individual resilience was negatively associated with the psychological outcomes. This suggests that the state needs to address the current mental health impacts of a long-drawn out lockdown and its long-term sequelae. Disproportionate burden on women needs immediate attention. Sustainable change requires addressing the root causes driving the gender inequalities in psychological distress during such crises."
64371,"The COVID-19 pandemic first appeared in Greece on 26 February 2020 when the first COVID-19 case imported from Νorthern Italy, was confirmed. Although various regions in the country have been affected since, the major epicentre of the epidemic was in the greater area of the capital city of Athens. Athens accommodates almost one third of the country's population, while it is the major economic and travelling centre of the country. Despite the fact that the first cases in various European countries appeared around the same time, Greece is one of the least affected by the pandemic countries [28] .

64397,"In summary a modified version of the SEIR model, incorporating asymptomatic individuals, was used for an-. CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0    ()  .   alyzing the effectiveness of different intervention protocols in controlling the growth of the Covid-19 pandemic. Non-clinical interventions can be either through social distancing or through testing-quarantining. Our results indicate that a combination of both, implemented over an extended period may be the most effective and practical strategy. We point out that short-term lock-downs cannot stop a recurrence of the pandemic if interventions are completely relaxed and developing herd immunity is not a practical solution either since this would affect a very large fraction of the population. We have provided numerical examples to illustrate the basic ideas and in addition, have stated a number of analytical results which can be useful in making empirical estimates of various important quantities that provide information on the disease progression. Looking at real data for new Covid-19 cases in several countries, we find that the extended SEIR model captures some important qualitative features and hence could provide guidance in policy-making. We use our analytic formulas to make predictions for disease peak numbers and expected time to peak for India, the state of Delhi and the city of Mumbai, but point out that these predictions could be incor-rect for India (due to big inhomogeneity in disease progression across the country) and perhaps more reliable for the cases of Delhi and Mumbai. Our formulas are easy to use and give quick heuristic estimates on disease progression, which would be reliable when applied to local populations (in towns, cities and perhaps smaller countries). While the lack of precise knowledge of the disease parameters (e.g the fraction of asymptomatic carriers) leads to rather large uncertainties in the predictions, they could perhaps be used to obtain reasonable bounds. "
64408,"The model presented in this work explores the epidemiological plausibility of a prolonged viral shedding window for the COVID-19 pandemic, and quantifies the impact of a gradual easing on the lockdown measures (relaxation) given different assumptions on the infectiousness of a chronically infectious population. Our results show that having a chronically infectious population, i.e., individuals that are less infectious but infectious for a longer duration, is not a possibility that can be easily rejected from an epidemiological perspective. This conclusion is based on two main results. First, the data that has been observed so far can be explained equally well by the model with prolonged viral shedding for a variety of different levels of reduced infectiousness as well as the null model, i.e., the model without prolonged viral shedding. Although this is partially due to the flexibility of the fitting procedure, the choice of hyperparameters (parameters of the prior distributions) indicate that all fits for a given reduced infectiousness value are possible for a set of reasonable model parameters, and therefore as favorable as the null model from a modeling perspective. Second, it is not clear whether the null model or the model with prolonged viral shedding provides more accurate predictions for the prospective data that is not included in the fitting procedure. The uncertainty around the prediction error values for different countries, different types of data (confirmed cases or deaths), and different data sizes used for fitting indicates that it is not always the null model that has the higher predictive power. Consequently, our analysis shows that it is not possible to either accept or reject the existence of a chronically infectious population with reasonable certainty from a modeling perspective. The fact that observed data can also be explained with a model including prolonged viral shedding raises certain questions about the interpretation of the epidemic curve, acquired immunity, and the current testing policies. Assuming a relatively short serial interval for a model that does not consider a prolonged viral shedding window results in more optimistic projections about epidemic control, as clearly demonstrated in Figs. 2 and 3. Countries that were very successful in their initial control measures and therefore experienced a very steep decline in the number of daily confirmed cases might choose to ease the control measures too soon. We still lack a full understanding of the viral shedding window of COVID-19, and therefore might have a biased opinion on the number of infectious individuals in the community. This once again emphasizes the infectiousness of COVID-19 and the significance of frequent testing although the number of confirmed cases are in decline. Building up on these conclusions and concerns, we investigate how the population dynamics would follow in case of a gradual easing on the lockdown measures (relaxation) in Switzerland considering different levels of infectiousness during a prolonged viral shedding window. Our results show that although the predictions present a similar shape for 7 . CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0    "
64429,"The paper makes a number of assumptions based on the schematics of different underground and overground cars on the London Underground. The capacity was calculated on the basis of these assumptions and shows a reduction in the projected capacity of the cars based on the adherence to social distancing principles. However it should be noted that another source gives a figure of 3 persons-per-metre squared as that intended in the original design of the transport cars (What do they know, 2020 (a)). Therefore the original standing capacity in Table 2 is an overestimation of standing capacity by 67%. This in turn means that social distancing person density is a 3800% reduction in standing capacity compared to the intended design although the subsequent analysis incorporating the geometry of the cars allows for a higher standing capacity. The main findings are that standing can occur in specified portions of the car but should avoid the area between the seats when they are occupied at capacity. The main standing areas would be in the space horizontally (i.e. parallel to the length of the car) adjacent to the seating areas and in front of the doors. These areas are of two types -wide and thin. For the wide areas, four standing people can be accommodated standing in the four corners of the area so as to maximally separate from each other. The passengers can stand close to the windows separating the standing area from the seating area. For the thin areas, two people can be accommodated on opposite sides. There are various seating areas but as a general rule, seating should be considered in the horizontal orientation and each row of seating can accommodate two people. The reduced capacity of each car requires a compensatory increase in the frequency of the underground trains or else an increase in the cars per train if this is possible, depending on the demand. A mismatch between the train capacity and the passengers may result in crowding on platforms depending on how the flow is managed. Another consideration is for the arrangements for boarding and alighting from the car which will require an increased time so as to enable passengers to maintain a distance of 2 metres from each other. Passengers would need to communicate with each other about how they will alight from the car whilst maintaining social distance. The standing and seated positions could be marked and an educational campaign initiated to ensure that commuters understand the logistics of this arrangement. Further consideration will be needed for the use of the glass barriers in separating standing and sitting passengers as if this cannot be used, then it would reduce the standing capacity. "
64441,"We examine available data on the number of individuals infected by the Covid-19 virus, across several different states in India, over the period January 30, 2020 to April 10, 2020. It is found that the growth of the number of infected individuals $N(t)$ can be modeled across different states with a simple linear function $N(t)=\gamma+\alpha t$ beyond the date when reasonable number of individuals were tested (and when a countrywide lockdown was imposed). The slope $\alpha$ is different for different states. Following recent work by Notari (arxiv:2003.12417), we then consider the dependency of the $\alpha$ for different states on the average maximum and minimum temperatures, the average relative humidity and the population density in each state. It turns out that like other countries, the parameter $\alpha$, which determines the rate of rise of the number of infected individuals, seems to have a weak correlation with the average maximum temperature of the state. In contrast, any significant variation of $\alpha$ with humidity or minimum temperature seems absent with almost no meaningful correlation. Expectedly, $\alpha$ increases (slightly) with increase in the population density of the states; however, the degree of correlation here too is negligible. These results seem to barely suggest that a natural cause like a hot summer (larger maximum temperatures) may contribute towards reducing the transmission of the virus, though the role of minimum temperature, humidity and population density remains somewhat obscure from the inferences which may be drawn from presently available data."
64460,"Since COVID-19 vaccine development will take significantly longer period of time before it becomes globally available, it is imperative on all medical sectors in the country to adhere to mitigation measures and intervention policies set by the government. The implementation of school closure, dusk to dawn curfew and partial lockdown are the mitigation effective in curbing the spread of COVID-19 that are effective and lead to the flattening of the curve within the duration of implementation. Relaxation of the mitigation measures on or before September 2020 will likely lead to a resurgence and the country may experience a new wave of infections. Devoid of the aftershocks of these interventions, the country will have no infections as at 31st December 2020. "
64522,"Movement and contact behaviors are key drivers of the spread of pathogens like SARS-CoV-2, yet not all movement and contacts have the same impact on pathogen spread. However, basic compartmental models used to describe SARS-CoV-2 dynamics assume all individuals move and contact each other at random (i.e., populations are well-mixed). Our models show how explicitly accounting for movement, space use in a building, and contact behaviors can provide a more nuanced understanding of relative risk. Our movement model, capturing the predictable movement between home and work/campus environments, shows that reducing the number of people, rate of contact, and amount of time spent on campus are all equivalently effective strategies for slowing pathogen spread. However, if commutes specifically increase transmission risk (i.e., shared transport), reducing the number of people on campus is the most effective strategy to reduce the infection spread rate. We also considered heterogeneity in contact behavior once at the workplace; our network model captures the regular interactions among workers in shared workspaces on campus and shows that restricting building use to lab spaces (rather than lab and office space) may reduce pathogen spread. Our results provide a number of tools to distinguish among different movement and contact patterns at the scale of individuals and workplace communities. A number of future directions could be explored, by changing some of our simplifying assumptions. First, staying within the broad structure of our model, alternative spatiotemporal strategies could be explored including: structured work weeks (e.g., 4 days on-campus and 10 off; Karin et al 2020), or further compartmentalizing time (e.g., sequential work shifts) or space (e.g., different buildings on campus). For instance, if evidence suggests that infection can occur through air circulation within buildings , these models could be altered to account for connections arising from shared ventilation systems. These models also could be modified to account for movement and contact behavior that explicitly depends on infection status (Narayanan et al. in revision) ; e.g., splitting infected individuals into asymptomatic (who still potentially commute to work) and symptomatic individuals (who stay home). Second, one could expand the scale of the model. This could be done foremost by combining the movement model (movement between work, commute, campus) with the network model (movement while on campus). Further expansions could consider both larger scales (linking in regional patterns) as well as smaller ones (allowing contacts within buildings to vary over time). For instance, structuring interaction networks with respect to age can greatly reduce deaths (Acemoglu et al 2020) and integrating local models such as this with regional variation in disease (Dong et al 2020) could inform recommendations as rates of active infection and immunity shift. Third, as contact-tracing data accumulate that implicate the most common routes of transmission, we can alter specific players or 11 . CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0    Human movement and contact behaviors are critical for the spread of pathogens like SARS-CoV-2, yet are rarely addressed explicitly in the current conversations about decision-making in the face of relaxing Stay at Home orders. Here we have drawn on movement and network models to demonstrate the effect of these behaviors. First, we have shown that regular movement between two 'environments' (i.e., work and home) does not inherently increase infection spread the way random dispersive movements might. Rather the outcome depends on the relative degree of transmission (e.g., degree of physical distancing) in each environment. Second, we have shown that different contact patterns (e.g., space usage) within the work environment could lead to different outcomes in terms of SARS-CoV-2 spread. In sum, we advocate for using an understanding of movement and contact patterns as an adjunctive approach (alongside widespread testing, contact tracing, vaccine development and other tools) to mitigate the effects of SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19, particularly when considering return to work environments.

64524,"Although our analyses estimate the expected burden of COVID-19 in a middle-income country with and without non-pharmacological social interventions, COVID-19 is still an evolving situation worldwide, and many uncertainties remain for this disease. Our analyses take the experience of China, Italy, and the United States, and attempt to provide a rough guide of interventions to prevent these adverse outcomes in an upper-middle income country like Colombia. The governments worldwide should consider economic and other societal externalities resulting from the implementation of these trigger thresholds and series of interventions. Our analyses provide decision-makers from middle-income, and potentially in poor economies, with evidence and data to base their decisions. While the trigger of 50 critical care admissions was effective in Colombia to prevent deaths, the trigger value would depend on the available critical care units of each country. . CC-BY-ND 4.0    "
64525,"Background: In Korea, a total of 8,799 confirmed cases of COVID-19 including 102 deaths have been recorded as of Mar 21, 2020. The time-delay adjusted case fatality risk of COVID-19 in Korea is yet to be estimated. Methods: We obtained the daily series of confirmed cases and deaths in Korea reported prior to March 21,2020. Using statistical methods, we estimated the time-delay adjusted risk for death from COVID-19 in the city of Daegu, Gyeongsangbuk-do, other regions in Korea, as well as for the entire country. Results: Our model-based crude CFR fitted the observed data well throughout the course of the epidemic except for the very early stage in Gyeongsangbuk-do, partially due to the reporting delay. Our estimates of the risk for death in Gyeongsangbuk-do reached 2.4% (95% CrI: 1.6-3.4%), 1.3% (95% CrI: 1.0-1.6%) in Daegu and 0.7% (95% CrI: 0.3-1.4%) in other regions, whereas the national estimate of the risk for death was estimated at 1.4% (95% CrI: 1.2-1.7%) in Korea. Conclusions: The relatively low CFRs are associated with the early implementation of public health interventions including widespread testing, social distancing, and delayed school openings in Korea. Geographic differences in CFR are likely influenced by clusters of nosocomial transmission."
64572,"The spread of the novel coronavirus is characterized by two phases: (I) a natural exponential growth phase that occurs in the absence of intervention and (II) a regulated growth phase that is affected by enforcing social distancing and isolation. We have developed a fundamental spreading model for the COVID-19 epidemic that has two parameters: the community transmission rate and a metric describing the degree of isolation and social distancing in a given community or region (country, state, county, or city). These two parameters are calibrated to data from the community, so the model uncertainty depends on the quality of the data and ability to test for COVID-19. The model shows that social distancing significantly reduces the epidemic spread and flattens the curve. The model predicts well the spreading trajectory and peak time of new infections for a community of any size and provides an upper estimate for the total number of infections and daily new infection rate for weeks into the future, providing the vital information and lead time needed to prepare for and mitigate the epidemic. The theory has immediate and far-reaching applications for ongoing outbreaks or similar future outbreaks of other emergent infectious diseases."
64623,"Finally, we consider a distributed lag model specification to empirically test whether changes in mobility weeks prior have an effect on current health outcomes from COVID-19. Across models we control for day-to-day changes common to all states and statespecific factors affecting health outcomes, state-specific trends affecting health outcomes, and distinguish between mandate and non-mandate states. We model daily new COVID 19 deaths and hospitalizations per 100 million residents by state as Where H sd is the daily health outcome reported for state s on date d, andṀ OB s,−k is the lagged change in the chosen mobility measure (one of average distance traveled, ADT , non-essential visitsṄ EV , or human encountersĖN C). k ∈ {1, 2, 3} so that 26 . CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0    Our estimates are an average of the effects of behavioral changes that occurred early in the COVID-19 pandemic as well as after states began implementing health policies. We estimate significant cumulative long-term effects of lagged mobility on current deaths, which provides preliminary evidence that the behavioral changes of reductions in mobility do contribute to flattening the health outcome curves weeks later. Specifically, we estimate that a one percent reduction in non-essential travel three weeks earlier has a significant long-term correlation of reducing deaths by 9.2 per 100 million each day. Given that residents across the U.S. averaged a decline of 40 percentage points in non-essential visits relative to baseline levels in the months of March and April, this would correspond to an estimated 360 (40 × 9) fewer daily deaths per 100 million residents. Using the estimated mandate-induced changes in non-essential visits of -4 percentage points from the weighted event study analyses, this is 10% of the overall reductions during this period and corresponds to a decline of 36 deaths per day due to mandate-induced behavior changes. We estimate a differential impact in mandate states which provides preliminary evidence that mandate policies convey long-term health impacts. Further, we estimate a differential impact in mandate states, providing preliminary evidence that stay-at-home mandates may convey positive cumulative long-term health impacts. Specifically, we estimate that a one percent reduction in average distance traveled three weeks earlier is significantly associated with 70 fewer deaths per 100 million per day. Given that on average residents across the U.S. CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0    Temporarily closing non-essential businesses and mandating residents stay at home except for essential activity is the prime policy instrument currently employed by states to promote social distancing and slow the transmission of COVID-19. If effective, these policies will have reduced strain on the medical system and provided much-needed time for the development of pharmaceutical treatments that can reduce transmission rates and end the pandemic. If unsuccessful, states will have incurred large economic costs with few lives saved. Whether these mandates cause people to stay at home and engage in social distancing is a key requirement of a successful policy. Knowing whether such policies will have their intended effect is of increasing policy relevance as all but eight states eventually adopted such policies. Understanding if and how individuals reduce travel activity in response to stay-at-home mandates and maintain social distance is the primary empirical question we tackle in this paper. First, we find that by the time the average adopter has implemented its statewide mandate, residents had already reduced travel by considerable amounts relative to pre-COVID-19 levels. Average travel distances had already fallen by 38 percentage points, human encounter rates by 76 percentage points, and non-essential visits by 52 percentage points before the first statewide mandate came into effect, providing evidence of extensive social distancing occurring even before they were required by statewide orders. Second, we find evidence that adoption of state-level stay-at-home mandates induced further reductions in all three travel activity measures. The mandate effect persists not just for the early adoption states (where residents' travel activity had not yet stabilized at new, lower norms) but also for mandates adopted weeks later. For the 63 . CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0    ()  .   early mandate states of California, Illinois, New Jersey, and New York, our staggered difference-in-differences models estimate a reduction in average distance traveled of 4.1 percentage points, a decline in visits to non-essential businesses of 5.2 percentage points, and a decrease in the rate of unique human encounters of 4.7 percentage points relative to pre-COVID-19 baselines. These effects remain present when considering all mandates implemented, albeit to a slightly smaller degree, with mandate ATT estimates of a −2.8 change in distance traveled, −4.5 change in non-essential visits, and a −3.6 change in unique human encounters. Estimated magnitudes remain highly comparable when directly accounting in differences in pre-mandate behavior for treatment and control states. Through the weighted event studies that construct control units to balance pre-treatment travel behavior net of state fixed effects, we find large, statistically significant drops immediately following mandate implementation that persist for the duration of the sample period. Resulting estimates of the overall mandate effects range between -7.29 and -6.47 for changes in average distance traveled, between -4.38 and -4.14 for non-essential visits, and between -5.87 and -4.98 for any mix of pooled and separate synthetic control weights. Our estimates suggest that, importantly, residents subject to stay-at-home mandates are on average responding as desired to curb the spread of COVID-19. Our empirical approaches isolate the mandate effect from other drivers of daily changes in travel activity levels, state-specific trends, and controls for a host of potential confounding factors that differ between states that adopted early policies relative to other states. In spite of these rigorous control approaches, we find persistent evidence of state mandates inducing further reductions in travel activity even after considerable earlier declines around the country. Further, our estimates are average treatment ef-64 . CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0    ()  .   fects in response to statewide mandates only; given the extents of prior school closures, new work from home abilities, and county-level stay-at-home policies, our findings represent only a portion of the way individuals responded to COVID-19 policies and are a considerable lower bound on how individuals responded to all COVID-19 policies. Linking changes in travel activity and social distancing to health outcomes, we find evidence that these reductions help ""flatten the curve"" and reduce health consequences. We find that, on average, a one percentage point decrease in non-essential visits per day three weeks prior has a long-term average effect of reducing nationwide death rates by 0.92 fewer deaths per million per day. Converting these reductions in deaths to economic benefits, we find that the observed reduced travel activity nationwide during the months of March and April translate into savings of $249-$755 billion due to associated reductions in deaths. Further, we find evidence of differential declines in deaths from shorter distances traveled in the first four states to adopt statewide mandates. Residents of these state were subject to modified business policies and face covering requirements for greater periods of time; our findings provide preliminary evidence that the non-pharmaceutical interventions employed by statewide mandates helped further flatten these states' epidemic curves. The reductions in deaths from a month-long mandate in these states are associated with total savings between $23.1 and $99.1 billion. Our findings have important policy implications for the fight against COVID-19. First, individuals on average responded as intended to statewide mandates. Despite considerable prior reductions, residents heeded their states' requests and stayed at home. Second, the declines in economic activity directly attributable to statewide 65 . CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0    ()  .   mandates may be much smaller than previously thought. As individuals around the country had already more than halved the quantity of trips taken to non-essential retail and service businesses, much of the lost business and resulting unemployment would have likely still occurred even if states had not adopted their stay-at-home policies. Further, as the mandate-induced reductions in visits to non-essential businesses amount to only one-tenth of the overall reductions since COVID-19, it is likely that loosening or removing statewide policies on their own will not be sufficient to induce mobility patterns to quickly return to pre-COVID-19 levels. Further policies will be needed to ensure that individuals can resume activity and return to local businesses in a manner that is safe. Our estimates do not take into account the benefits from avoided hospitalizations and other indirect health benefits from reduced travel activity and social distancing. As reductions in travel distance and increased social distance likely decrease exposure to other potentially deadly illnesses, this is likely an underestimation of the overall health benefit of these policies. Further, the patterns in under-reporting and undercounting of COVID-19 deaths provide further evidence that we likely underestimate the direct benefits of these policies. Future identification of additional COVID-19 deaths may prove difficult, as many death certificates list only the immediate cause of death and fail to report underlying diseases -likely understating the presence of COVID-19 [40] . Further, procedures for counting COVID-19 deaths may be correlated with adoption of stay-at-home mandates. If adoption of a state-level ordinance indicates additional preparedness on the part of the adopting state, then states that were slower to (or had yet to) pass stay-at-home mandates may also have been slower to properly attribute deaths to COVID-19, resulting in our estimated effects being under-66 .

As a result it may not ever be possible to determine the exact loss of life due to COVID-19, and accordingly we heed caution in interpreting our result as capturing a de-facto relationship. We support continued efforts to obtain accurate counts of the mortality and morbidity consequences from COVID-19 to help ensure future research can provide sufficient policy guidance in the case of future pandemics. While this paper sets out to understand an important and timely question and provides benefit estimates to help policymakers evaluate tradeoffs and weigh the costs and benefits of extending and relaxing such policies, there are avenues for future research that could be explored. First, whether these policies result in a true flattening of the epidemic curve or merely postpone illness is an avenue that deserves additional attention. Particularly as states weigh the difficult decisions of reopening business as usual, it is necessary to understand how caseloads and health consequences may rebound. Second, future work should also consider within-state policy variation and the relationship between local and national policies. Knowing whether county-level mandates that preceded statewide policies conveyed additional benefits will help improve our understanding of the full set of policy tools available to combat future pandemics. Further, the economic forces and psychological incentives behind compliance with stay-at-home mandates are complex, and additional work is needed that can characterize the mechanisms behind the policy effects we observe. "
64632,"Taken together, we demonstrate that the rate of spread of COVID-19 in the United States is concave in the number of contagious individuals. This explains why the growth rate of COVID-19 cases has been slower than expected given the initial exponential growth, above and beyond the effect from social distancing. We empirically identify the substantial impact of social-distancing on combating the pandemic. We also forecast how COVID-19 will evolve in the future, and the timing over which different parts of the country will reach their peaks and how the patterns may affect our reopening strategies. 16may2020 01jun2020 01jul2020 01aug2020 01sep2020 30sep2020 Date 16may2020 01jun2020 01jul2020 01aug2020 01sep2020 30sep2020  "
64656,We investigate the effects of social distancing in controlling the impact of the COVID-19 epidemic using a simple susceptible-infected-removed epidemic model. We show that an alternative or complementary approach based on targeted isolation of the vulnerable sub-population may provide a more efficient and robust strategy at a lower economic and social cost within a shorter timeframe resulting in a collectively immune population.
64668,"After weeks under lockdown, metropolitan areas fighting the spread of COVID-19 aim to balance public health goals with social and economic standards for well-being. Mathematical models of disease transmission seeking to evaluate mitigation strategies must assess the possible impacts of social distancing, economic lockdowns and other measures. However, obscure relations between model parameters and real-world phenomena complicate such analyses. Here, we use a high-resolution metapopulation model of Guadalajara (GDL, Western Mexico) to represent daily mobility patterns driven by economic activities and their relation to epidemic growth. Given the prominence of essential activities in the city's economy, we find that strategies aiming to mitigate the risk of out-of-home interactions are insufficient to stop the catastrophic spread of COVID-19. Using baseline reproduction numbers R0 = [2.5, 3.0] in the absence of interventions, our simulations suggest that household transmission alone can make Rt ~ 1, and is estimated to drive 70 {+/-} 15% of current epidemic growth. This sets an upper bound for the impact of mobility-based interventions, which are unlikely to lower Rt below 1.3 and must be complemented with aggressive campaigns for early case detection and isolation. As laboratory testing and health services become insufficient to meet demand in GDL and most other cities, we propose that cities facilitate guidelines and equipment to help people curb spreading within their own homes. Postponing these actions will increase their economic cost and decrease their potential returns."

64721,"In this work, the dynamics of COVID-19 spread in India from the beginning until June 8, 2020 are analyzed. Different mathematical models are used to describe the initial rapid growth (phase-1), slow growth immediately after lockdown (phase-2), and later and more recent fast growth (phase-3). It is shown that exponential, linear and quadratic curves define these phases with high statistical significance. The switch from linear to quadratic growth after lockdown is suspected to be related to the order-of-magnitude increase in the diagnostic testing capacity. However, an increase in the positivity rate nearly 1.5 months after the lockdown, inconsistent with what is observed for other countries, indicates that the testing capacity may still not be adequate. Future projections based on available data are made using both phenomenological and mechanistic models. These models have high variability in the prediction of the peak, and even the most optimistic case projects the flattening of the curve in September. The accuracies of these predictions are also limited in the absence of an accurate estimate of the true number of cases due to insufficient testing capacity. Therefore, these models should be regularly revisited, as more and more reliable estimates of the infections become available with 6 . CC-BY-ND 4.0    increasing testing capacity.

64737,"Background The government of India implemented social distancing interventions to contain the COVID-19 epidemic. However, effects on epidemic dynamics are yet to be understood. Methods Rates of laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 infections per day and effective reproduction number (Rt) were estimated for 4 periods (Pre-lockdown and Lockdown Phases 1 to 3) according to nationally implemented phased interventions. Adoption of these interventions was estimated using Google mobility data. Estimates at the national level and for 12 Indian states most affected by COVID-19 are presented. Findings Daily case rates ranged from 0.03 to 30.05/10 million people across 4 discrete periods in India. From May 4-17, 2020, the National Capital Territory (NCT) of Delhi had the highest case rate (222/10 million people/day), whereas Kerala had the lowest (2.18/10 million/day). Average Rt was 1.99 (95% CI 1.93-2.06) for India; it ranged from 1.38 to 2.78, decreasing over time. Median mobility in India decreased in all contact domains, with the lowest being 21% in retail/recreation (95% CI 13-46%), except home which increased to 129% (95% CI 117-132%) compared to the 100% baseline value. Interpretation The Indian government imposed strict contact mitigation, followed by a phased relaxation, which slowed the spread of COVID-19 epidemic progression in India. The identified daily COVID-19 case rates and Rt will aid national and state governments in formulating ongoing COVID-19 containment plans. Furthermore, these findings may inform COVID-19 public health policy in developing countries with similar settings to India. Funding Non-funded."
64743,"In this study we have extended the SEIR model to allow for general transition-time distributions and developed an estimation strategy in which we first retrieved the latent number of infectious and susceptible individuals per day, and subsequently estimated the ECR per day. This way, we did not make a priori assumptions on consistency across countries and delays in the effect of governmental interventions. Our findings show that change points in the daily ECRs overlap with moments of governmental interventions. Overall, the first set of measures taken by the governments seems to have an immediate (although heterogeneous) effect. This first set of measures typically included the closure of schools and daycares, as well as banning events. Implementing a full lockdown after the first set of measures, either locally or nationally, seemed to coincide with changes in the ECR, but in several countries only when this was enforced with increased police surveillance. Although the effect of closing schools and banning events has been demonstrated in previous studies 1,4 , our findings suggested a stronger (combined) effect of the first set of measures than found before. On the contrary, these studies observed more serious effects of a gathering bans, lockdowns, and closure of bars and restaurants 1,4 . These differences may be explained by the additional model restrictions (constant contact rates, country homogeneous effect sizes, and fixed delay in the effects) that these studies implemented. Therefore, they could not determine whether the effect of the full lockdown did change over time as we observed. Our observation is in line with the Google mobility data (Appendix E) that suggests that mobility did further reduce in the days after the ordering of the lockdown in Italy, Spain and .

64757,"The approach of a second phase of the pandemic into a new normality is full of uncertainties from the point of view of social and economic planning. It is clear to the people that this period cannot be marked by an ""all free"", by a return to the old normality. For some time to come it will be necessary to respect rules of conduct and hygiene standards to which we have not been accustomed. There are many issues to be addressed, in particular how gradually to reopen the various social and economic activities without creating a new wave of infected and therefore deaths. In order to analyze possible future scenarios, it is essential to have models capable of describing the impact of the epidemic according to the specific social characteristics of the country and the containment actions implemented. In this work, aware of the complexity of the problem, we have tried to provide a suitable modeling context to describe possible future scenarios in this direction. The use of a SIR model with social structure modified through appropriate feedback controls allows to obtain simulations in agreement with the current epidemic scenarios in different countries, including Germany, France, Italy, Spain, the United Kingdom and the United States. The inclusion of uncertainty about the actual value of the number of infected people makes it possible to analyze the effects of the potential reopening of productive and social activities at different times. A multi-modelling approach aligned with the current epidemiological and demographic data, which includes experimental social interaction matrices for the different countries, permits to contextualize possible future scenarios. Further studies are being conducted on geographical dependence through spatial variables. This would make it possible to characterize control measures on a local rather than global basis. .

64783,"The COVID-19 pandemic revealed an exponential rise in the reported number of cases and affected the public health ranging from mild to severe conditions. Countries across the world are combating the spread of the coronavirus through various social distancing/intervention measures such as closure of schools and universities, banning of public events and large gatherings, isolation of symptomatic COVID-19 cases, mass quarantines etc. For national as well as international control of public health, it is crucial to understand the significance of the onset timing of such measures [29] . The World Health Organisation lately reports new cases being reported into several new countries across the globe [30] [31] [32] . Our study can provide an insight to tackle the ongoing pandemic and its associated growth curve in the context of the timing and strength of the interventions. We use the data of the number of COVID-19 cases in nine different countries to investigate some statistical patterns in the growth curves. The number of cases covers a small fraction of the population during the initiation of the epidemic, and the fraction remains nearly stagnant for around 20 days from the arrival of the first case. After the threshold of around 20 days, the number of cases starts increasing rapidly, and in a relatively shorter span a significant fraction of the population can be affected. This trend is analogous to the idea that the growth curve remains close to one stable state for sufficient time and, crossing a time threshold invokes a sudden shift/transition to another stable state, where a significant fraction of the population gets affected. In our work, we employ statistical indicators of critical slowing down to check if such transitions can be signaled beforehand and how the anticipation of such transitions can help mitigate such crisis at a policy level. We observe that the 35-40 days window from the arrival of the first case in each country signaled an impending transition. In the vicinity of 35-40 days, an increase in the short term memory (at lag 1) of the data as well as a decrease in the return rate indicates the phenomenon of critical slowing down. Our work suggests that while non-pharmaceutical interventions are necessary to mitigate such epidemic, the timing of initiation of concerned actions can strongly influence the outcome of the situation. Owing to the time lag in the detection of symptomatic cases, the statistical indicators suggest that the initial 20-25 days being crucial to suppress the loss of public health. The controlled response of the epidemic growth curve for China and South Korea can be associated with the time distance between implementation of interventions and the transition point. Thus, EWSs analyses is crucial while defining the onset of the interventions and suppress the rise of daily cases. Importantly, another crucial aspect is the proportion of affected cases in each country, i.e., a measure of the fraction of the country's population, and not the absolute numbers, which is infected at the time of interventions such as a strict lockdown. As probability of the propagation of disease can be thought of as mostly similar or equal amongst individuals across the globe, it depends upon the fraction of infected cases in each country during the beginning of interventions. For instance, a decrease in the return rate and increased autocorrelation anticipated the upcoming rise in the growth curves for both India as well as Italy, and interestingly, both the countries imposed individual nationwide lockdown near the situation close to the transition (Table I) . However, the control in India depicts better results in altering the growth curve than that in Italy. The alterations in the growth curve is most likely to be a consequence of a difference in the proportion of cases affected by the epidemic at the beginning of mitigation strategies. India resembling China in terms of the total population density accounted for approximately 2.36 × 10 −7 cases of the total population, while Italy with relatively less population density crossed 1.22 × 10 −4 cases of their total population. Thus, even with imposition of the public health measures near the signals of CSD, the outcome for both the countries can dramatically vary. Furthermore, the disruptive situation in the US is indicated by EWSs, as the EWSs indicators were visible quite early for the US. Thus, sharp rise in the number of cases for the country is a consequence of both the delay in effective social distancing interventions . CC-BY-NC 4.0   author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity. is the (which was not peer-reviewed)    as well as a large proportion of affected cases at that time. Overall, our work suggests that in almost all the countries, a sharp upcoming rise in the growth curve can be captured using statistical measures, before the actual transition. Another horizon the infectious coronavirus put forwards is on the quality of air pollution in countries where social distancing/lockdown is enforced. NO 2 , which is majorly emitted from anthropogenic activities like land transportation, industries, and energy sectors, was estimated to decrease in consequence of lockdown measures implemented by the government of respective countries. Population weighted average column NO 2 was found to decrease with amplification in a number of cases across most of the countries. Apart from this, NO 2 column quantities may be used as a proxy to estimate the effectiveness of a lockdown on air quality. We find that NO 2 column quantities started following a decreasing trend during the last week of February in Italy and US which indicate a partial unofficial closure of anthropogenic activities, taking into consideration that the official COVID-19 induced lockdown was enforced on 09 March and around 25 March in Italy and the US, respectively. Whereas, in the UK, an increasing trend in NO 2 column till the last week of March indicates no such public awareness to restrict anthropogenic activities (the government declared the lockdown from 23 March). We acknowledge that the reduction in NO 2 is also associated with the compliance of the population of the individual nation to abide by the lockdown measures. Furthermore, we suggest that the interventions employed by India may not be at the time when the curve is very far from reaching the transition; however, the smaller proportion of affected cases may be the determining factor in limiting the disease spread in India. Implementation of a nationwide lockdown in India may have better prepared the country for taking measures to control the epidemic spread and bend the curve. However, our analyses also suggest that the period beyond the signals of CSD also needs efficient monitoring. The result of our minimal stochastic model predicts that on 15 April, the number of infected people can go up to approximately 13500. Thus, the extended period of such measures are needed and likely to be effective [5] . We envision that it is fundamental to identify the situation of such a crisis across the world and make use of the lead time. The EWSs can keep track of the changes in the trend statistics in the number of reported cases and warn when a threshold is reached. The statistical tools used can be beneficial to identify whether the features of shift in a system are suppressed by the intervention strategies being adopted. In particular, while different combinations of strategies are adopted to overcome such crisis, the information of an upcoming transition and its threshold is important to formulate the degree of such interventions. However, special care should be taken in the choice of rolling window size and the filtering bandwidth while estimating the signals of slowing down. Inappro-priate choices may give weak and/or diminish the signals of an imminent transition, which may deviate from understanding the urgency of the situation. Another aspect to consider is that the varying extent of testing for COVID-19 across the countries may have affected the total number of reported cases; thus, our results here hold specifically for the number of reported cases. "
64820,"The exponential character of the recent Covid-19 outbreak requires a change in strategy from containment to mitigation. Meanwhile, most countries apply social distancing with the objective to keep the number of critical cases below the capabilities of the health care system. Due to the novelty and rapid spread of the virus, an a priori assessment of this strategy was not possible. In this study, we present a model-based systems analysis to assess the effectiveness of social distancing measures in terms of intensity and duration of application. Results show a super-linear scaling between intensity (percent contact reduction) and required duration of application to have an added value (lower fatality rate). This holds true for an effective reproduction of R > 1 and is reverted for R < 1. If R is not reduced below 1, secondary effects of required long-term isolation are likely to unravel the added value of disease mitigation. We recommend an extinction strategy implemented by intense countermeasures."
64825,"As can be seen from Figure 2 , the simulations displayed above correlate well with data found in the biomedical literature. As seen in Figure 3 , the number of deaths in Italy and the United Kingdom correlate well with the predicted deaths. The number of recorded cases also conform well with the simulation, however they may be slightly higher due to the larger number of people getting tested than actually being hospitalised. All in all, it is clearly seen that the simulation overall reflects the available data well. Now, looking at the simulations for the UK, we can explore the different outcomes for the different approaches taken. If, like Sweden, the UK were to take the route of relying on herd immunity, as seen in Figure 4 , almost all of the population becomes immune (with the exception of the 1.3% of the population that die). The length of time that this will take is just over three months as seen in the graphs. So, the result of this approach would be a relatively fast outcome with a large percentage of people immune, but with the downside of having an estimated 800,000 mortalities. However, the UK has not taken this approach and has instead decided to adopt a social distancing approach and go on lockdown. If UK's lockdown goes perfectly (as shown in Figure 5 ), the pandemic will be resolved in roughly 1.5 months with only 21, 000 dead. However, seeing as UK is only going on a semi-lockdown (with e.g. many people still going to work and using public transportation), the likelihood of this seems very low. It seems much more likely that the result of this semi-lockdown looks more like Figure 6 , with 4.5 months of ng this semi-lockdown and with approximately 80, 000 dead. We can also see what happens if the lockdown is even more relaxed, with people going out at times that aren't completely necessary because people start to grow bored. If people do start to take this lockdown less seriously -especially young people who believe that they will not get gravely ill due to their youth -it might result in things looking more like Figure 7 , with the 'lockdown' taking over 6+ months and resulting in more than 300, 000 fatalities. This reflects just how important it is to stay at home; the more relaxed we become the longer this is going to take with more deaths occurring, which is what no one wants. To conclude on the simulations, we can see that the less seriously lockdown is taken, or the less strict we are about this lockdown, the longer this will take. If this lockdown isn't done to a high enough standard, it is evident that this will take much longer, with the results not looking too different to 8 . CC-BY 4.0    "
64838,"Our modeling exercise showed that with no intervention (i.e., scenario A), more than five million COVID-19 infections would occur in Iran till mid-June, of whom 18.9% would be hospitalized and 2.1% would die. However, under the best-case scenario (i.e., scenario E), the number of infected cases could be reduced by 90%, hospitalizations by 92%, and deaths by 93%. Our projection in scenario C, which is a middle ground scenario, appeared to be aligned with the current statistics from the national reports. Even under scenario C, the burden of the epidemic in Iran will be large, last for several months and might surpass the current capacity of the healthcare system.  "
64856,"This modeling analysis in three key countries illustrates that even short COVID-related lockdowns can generate long-lasting setbacks in TB control. Our results suggest that, even in a moderate lockdown scenario, over the next five years TB deaths could see increases of 2-6%, while TB incidence could see increases of 1-4%, in the three countries studied here. This impact would increase roughly threefold under a severe lockdown scenario (Figures 1 and 2 , and Table  2 ). Our results also illustrate how these long-term dynamics depend strongly on the duration of the disruption: in the example of India, each additional month of restoration could cause an additional 133,000 cases and 34,400 deaths over the next five years (Table 3) . .

64870,"In this paper, we quantify the causal impact of human mobility restrictions, particularly the lockdown of the city of Wuhan on January 23, 2020, on the containment and delay of the spread of the Novel Coronavirus, and estimate the dynamic effects of up to 22 lagged population inflows from Wuhan and other Hubei cities, the epicenter of the 2019-nCoV outbreak, on the destination cities' new infection cases. We find that the lockdown of Wuhan reduced inflow into Wuhan by 76.64%, outflows from Wuhan by 56.35%, and within-Wuhan movements by 54.15%. Using counterfactual simulations with these estimates, we find that the lockdown of the city of Wuhan on January 23, 2020 contributed significantly to reducing the total infection cases outside of Wuhan, even with the social distancing measures later imposed by other cities. We find that the COVID-19 cases would be 64.81% higher in the 347 Chinese cities outside Hubei province, and 52.64% higher in 16 non-Wuhan cities inside Hubei, in the counterfactual world in which the city of Wuhan were not locked down from January 23, 2020. We also find that there were substantial undocumented infection cases in the early days of the 2019-nCoV outbreak in Wuhan and other cities of Hubei province, 21 .

We also find evidence that imposing enhanced social distancing policies in the 63 Chinese cities outside Hubei province is effective in reducing the impact of population inflows from the epicenter cities in Hubei province on the spread of 2019-nCoV virus in the destination cities elsewhere. The results from our analysis provide valuable causal evidence on the role of human mobility restrictions on the containment and delay of the spread of contagious viruses, including the 2019-nCoV virus that is now ravaging the world. Enhanced social distancing in the destination cities, and, if an epicenter can be identified as was the case for the city of Wuhan in China, a lockdown, can play crucial roles in ""flattening"" the daily infection cases curve, giving the stressed medical system a chance to regroup and deal with the onslaught of new infection cases. Although our study focuses exclusively on the effect of human mobility restrictions on the spread of 2019-nCoV virus in China, our estimated results can have general implications to other countries in their fight against the Novel Coronavirus.

We present median, 50% and 95% quantiles of differences in outcomes across all combinations, and show results stratified by 0 in the Supplementary Material. For the impact of individual interventions, we considered severe cases as our primary outcome. For the impact of different strategies, we observed the total number of symptomatic cases, severe cases (those who require hospitalisation), critical cases (those who require intensive care, ICU), and deaths, and present the expected time until peak of the epidemic, including peak bed demand that would be required. We only show estimates for the first 12 months after introduction of the first case, as the evolution of the epidemic beyond this period is subject to considerable unknowns (e.g. availability of vaccines or therapeutics; virus mutation, persistence of natural immunity). "
64899,"Public health policies to contain the spread of COVID-19 rely mainly on non-pharmacological measures. Those measures, especially social distancing, are a challenge for developing countries, such as Brazil. In Sao Paulo, the most populous state in Brazil (45 million inhabitants), most COVID-19 cases up to April 18th were reported in the Capital and metropolitan area. However, the inner municipalities, where 20 million people live, are also at risk. As governmental authorities discuss the loosening of measures for restricting population mobility, it is urgent to analyze the routes of dispersion of COVID-19 in those municipalities. In this ecological study, we use geographical models of population mobility as patterns for spread of SARS-Cov-2 infection. Based on surveillance data, we identify two patterns: one by contiguous diffusion from the capital metropolitan area and other that is hierarchical, with long-distance spread through major highways to cities of regional relevance. We also modelled the impact of social distancing strategies in the most relevant cities, and estimated a beneficial effect in each and every setting studied. This acknowledgement can provide real-time responses to support public health strategies."
64973,"In this study, we compare how two distinct types of contact-based control strategies, contact tracing and large-scale lockdowns/self-quarantine or social distancing, impact the characteristics of single or sequential COVID-19 outbreaks. We find that contact tracing generally is less effective in decreasing outbreak size for rapidly spreading pathogens (high baseline re-15   ()   .   production number R 0,b ), unless the tracing is very efficient. On the other hand, widespread lockdowns/social distancing interventions can lower outbreak size inversely proportional to an increase in the rate of self-quarantine. Our analysis indicates that China benefited from the heavy influence of lockdowns by rapidly containing the quickly growing COVID-19 cases, and, despite massive efforts, contact tracing was less influential in bringing down the epidemic. Despite the difference in the targeted nature of contact tracing versus the more indiscriminate lockdown measures, we contend there is a similar reactive quality to both control strategies. Contact tracing reacts to reported cases by tracking and (to varying degrees) quarantining individuals whom have been contacted. Mass social distancing or self-quarantine reflects a natural response by both governments and individuals which intensifies as cases build, a phenomenon that has been labeled as ""exponential whiplash"" (15) . These features motivate us to construct a COVID-19 model with both contact tracing (mechanistically) and self-quarantine (phenomenologically) dependent on force of infection. In contrast to another model which assumes a linear rate of self-quarantine (6), the nonlinear social distancing rate captures a contagion-like behavioral response to infected cases, and allows us to derive novel formulae for final outbreak size. Furthermore the model provides a good simultaneous fit to both cumulative reported cases and daily quarantined contact data from China. An important distinction between contact tracing and lockdowns is their mode of action, namely preventing onward secondary infections by early tracking of likely infected cases in the former and large-scale depletion (or shielding) of susceptible individuals for the latter. This contrast determines how they affect the major epidemiological quantities of reproduction number and outbreak size in our ""transmission-reactive"" formulation. In particular, contact tracing proportionally reduces R 0 , akin to vaccination, leading to a nonlinear relationship with final outbreak size, which decreases substantially only as R 0 approaches one. The responsive selfquarantine rate does not affect R 0 , and we derive a simple inverse proportionality with outbreak 16   ()   .   size. Because the rate can be translated to a time of action for social distancing measures, this result analytically demonstrates the escalating impacts of delaying implementation of responsive lockdowns beyond a critical time period, which has been observed in other studies via simulation (16, 17) . Even though similar levels of self-quarantine would eventually be reached in our model as incidence grows, the cost of delays can result in a large excess of cases. Although we find that the extensive lockdowns and social distancing was a much larger factor in controlling COVID-19 outbreak size in China, our sensitivity analysis shows that contact tracing did dampen and delay peak number of infected despite its more limited impact on the cumulative count. In this way, contact tracing can flatten the incidence curve, easing the strain on limited hospital resources. A combination of expediently enacted contact-based interventions may be the best strategy, where effective contact tracing and responsive social distancing measures can synergistically and efficiently suppress an outbreak. However COVID-19 has proved to be a particular challenge and large-scale lockdowns have been a needed antidote for controlling outbreaks in several countries. The drastic self-quarantine orders can also reduce case numbers to a more manageable level and hopefully allow for effective contact tracing in the event of incidence occurrence after easing restrictions. The capacity to respond to the continuing threat of COVID-19 will be vital for minimization of sequential epidemic waves. We investigated control measures under an instantaneous normalization of contact for a large portion (or several sectors) of the population versus a more gradual release of self-quarantined individuals back into social interactions. Our results show that increased contact tracing efforts can alter the second outbreak shape, either reducing and spreading out the number of infected or completely suppressing cases for highly efficient tracing. Social distancing or lockdown measures responsive to incidence can effectively compress the second peaks, with the timing being critical again. Either measure will depend upon sufficient case detection and reporting, highlighting the importance of testing. Furthermore, in-17   ()   . definite or reoccurring strict lockdowns are likely to impart too high of an economic cost, and our model shows that looser restrictions and contact tracing can still reduce a second wave to manageable levels. Additionally, the strategy of gradual release of quarantined sectors can substantially delay the second wave, possibly buying time for effective treatments or vaccines to be developed. There are factors not considered in our current study which may have played an important role in determining the COVID-19 epidemic in China. For example, we neglect a more finegrained regional structure within China for our model and data fitting. However, a major novelty of this work was to incorporate data on the quarantined contacts, which was compiled solely for the whole of China. Obtaining provincial quarantine records may allow for simultaneous fitting of the heterogeneous spread of the virus in different regions of China. Furthermore, more detailed contact tracing data quantifying the proportion of reported cases whom were traced can allow for superior accuracy in estimating efficacy of contact tracing, which can add confidence to our conclusion that lockdowns had substantially larger influence in controlling the COVID-19 outbreak data. Nevertheless, the analytical and qualitative results here illustrate the differential effects that reactive contact tracing and lockdowns or mass self-quarantine have on outbreak shape. This knowledge and further investigation may offer insights for the public health response to COVID-19 outbreaks.   ()   .   "
64974,"Kenya has implemented strict control measures in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. This study highlights the difficult decisions policymakers face as we find that control measures are likely to have substantially reduced COVID-19 transmission, but also negatively impacted food and economic security of informal settlement residents. This is the first study to measure social contact patterns after COVID-19 control measures have been implemented in sub-Saharan Africa. There is evidence that impacts are inequitable, as the poorest quintile report 1.5 times more contacts than the richest quintile, and 86% of respondents reported complete or partial income losses. Negative and inequitable impacts on economic and food security may mean control measures are not sustainable in the longer term without social protection. . CC-BY 4.0    "
65023,"The goal of the lockdown is to mitigate and if possible prevent the spread of an epidemic. It consists in reducing social interactions. This is taken into account by the introduction of a factor of reduction of social interactions q, and by decreasing the transmission coefficient of the disease accordingly. Evaluating q is a difficult question and one can ask if it makes sense to compute an average coefficient q for a given population, in order to make predictions on the basic reproduction rate R0, the dynamics of the epidemic or the fraction of the population that will have been infected by the end of the epidemic. On a very simple example, we show that the computation of R0 in a heterogeneous population is not reduced to the computation of an average q but rather to the direct computation of an average coefficient R0. Even more interesting is the fact that, in a range of data compatible with the Covid-19 outbreak, the size of the epidemic is deeply modified by social heterogeneity, as is the height of the epidemic peak, while the date at which it is reached mainly depends on the average R0 coefficient."
65076,"The current outbreak of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19), epi-centered in Hubei Province of the People's Republic of China, has spread to many other countries.

65108,"The global spread of 2019-nCoV, a new virus belonging to the coronavirus family, forced national and local governments to apply different sets of measures aimed at containing its outbreak. Los Angeles has been one of the first cities in the United States to declare the state of emergency on March 4th, progressively issuing stronger policies involving--among the others--social distancing, the prohibition of crowded private and public gatherings and closure of leisure premises. These interventions highly disrupt and modify daily activities and habits, urban mobility and micro-level interactions between citizens. One of the many social phenomena that could be influenced by such measures is crime. Exploiting public data on crime in Los Angeles, and relying on routine activity and pattern theories of crime, this work investigates whether and how new coronavirus containment policies have an impact on crime trends in a metropolis using Bayesian structural time-series (BSTS) models. The article specifically focuses on nine urban crime categories, daily monitored from January 1st 2017 to March 28th 2020.

While numerous factors such as population density, healthcare infrastructure, testing rates, climate, population characteristics, and more, likely contribute to rate of COVID19 spread, this study focused on the change in COVID19 spread rate following implementation of social distancing policies as an internal control for these variables. This analysis found that social distancing policies significantly reduced spreading rates compared to time-matched intervals in nations that did not implement social distancing policies. While social distancing policies may have negative economic impacts (Eichenbaum et al., 2020) , this analysis suggests that this containment approach has yielded significant positive health outcomes. As testing capacities increase, contact tracing may provide an alternative to minimize economic impacts by only quarantining those who are exposed to infected individuals. This approach has already demonstrated high efficacy in the context of nations with high testing capacity (Anderson et al., 2020) . Technological advancements, such as potential phone-based contact tracing Apps, may further enhance the benefit achieved by contact tracing approaches (Ferretti et al., 2020) . The emergence of further refined data will allow for more precise quantification of various approaches to mitigate the spread of COVID19. This analysis based on 53 countries indicates that social distancing can serve as a critical preventative measure until prophylactic measures and larger population immunity are generated.   ()   .

65161,"In the absence of a vaccine and effective antiviral medications, most of the non-pharmaceutical interventions focus on reducing social contact rates through different social distancing policies. However, the effectiveness of different policies and their relative impact vis-a-vis that of mechanisms driven by public awareness and voluntary actions have not been studied. This is crucial since in most places we observe significant reductions in social interaction before any policy was implemented. Variations in types and effective dates of different social distancing policies across different states in the US create a natural experiment to study the causal impact of each policy during the early stage of the outbreak. Using these policy variations and the aggregate human mobility and location trends published by Google for the month of March 2020, we employ a quasi-experimental approach to measure the impact of six common policies on people's presence at home and their mobility in different types of public places. Our results rank six common social distancing policies based on the magnitude and significance of their impact, beyond what has already been achieved through voluntary actions. They show that while strong policies such as statewide stay home mandate and non-essential business closure have strong causal impacts on reducing social interactions, most of the expected impact of more lenient policies (such as large gathering ban and school closure mandates) are already reaped from non-policy mechanisms such as voluntary actions and public awareness."
65166,"Epidemiological outcomes. Epidemiological outcome measures and non-epidemiological proxy measures are simulated. Epidemiological outcome measures are: (i) Percent of the initial population ultimately infected on Day 365, (ii) deaths per 1,000, (iii) peak prevalence and incidence rates, (iv) days to peak prevalence and incidence. Increased deaths due to an overwhelmed health system are not counted under the deaths per 1,000 outcome measure but are modelled using a proxy measure which is the sum of the squares of daily prevalence throughout the simulation period that is above a health system capacity threshold. The health system capacity threshold is based on the world average hospital beds per capita (World Development Indicators 2020) and adjusted for the mean duration of hospitalization, the proportion of symptomatic ""I"" cases, the proportion of symptomatic patients requiring hospitalization. The daily prevalence above this threshold was squared to penalize extreme breaches of this day-to-day capacity threshold. This measure of an overwhelmed health system is referred to here as the 'over-capacity factor'. Non-epidemiological outcomes. Non-epidemiological proxy measures of the of NPIs on economic and social activity are: (i) aggregate acts per person over the intervention period and (ii) aggregate daily acts per person, square rooted, over the intervention period. The square rooted measure prizes smooth rather than pulsatile lockdowns and may be relevant for certain economic and social activities. . CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0    'Shrink the area under curve' not just 'flatten the curve'. In all scenarios simulated 6 , the percentage of the initial population infected by Day 365, at which steady state without prior elimination of infections and without NPIs has been reached (analogous to herd immunity), is high but varies widely by scenario. In the baseline scenario, this percentage is the highest at 89.0 percent. In the most optimal scenario simulated for reducing cumulative infections (Figure 7 Scenario E4) this was 17.9 percentage points lower. Applied on a global scale, this corresponds to sparing 1.4 billion people from the morbidity and mortality associated with COVID-19 infection. B-series scenarios indicate that NPIs not only flatten the curve to avoid overwhelming health system capacity but shrink the area under the curve especially when applied towards the end of the outbreak. This insight is relevant even for countries which may have missed instituting NPI measures early as a final punch of NPIs to prevent overshoot, even after cases has peaked, will likely reduce mortality and morbidity independently of the effect of keeping the burden of COVID-19 cases within health system capacity. Timing affects different dimensions performance. If a single lockdown is envisaged, this should not be done too early or too late. For best reductions in peak prevalence, the timing should aim to 'split the mountain' into two roughly equal bimodal peaks. For best reductions in cumulative infections, covering the later stage of the outbreak with a later lockdown is superior, but at the expense of higher peak prevalence. This point may already be moot for many countries which have instituted lockdowns in response to a spike in COVID-19 cases but may be issues to be considered for those not yet under lockdown. Diminishing marginal returns for extending prolonged lockdowns. The extra 70 days of a 120day of lockdown, compared with a 50-day lockdown, merely delayed the peak day of incidence by 20 days and did not prevent a resurgence of COVID-19 as the population remains non-immune after the intervention. Under the epidemiological parameters and population characteristics simulated for this hypothetical population, none of the C-series 'smash-the-mountain' strategies were able to eradicate COVID-19 fully, even in this closed population of 100,000. The technical strength of the stochastic ICM model used for these simulations, compared to deterministic compartment models, is that full eradication is a possible outcome as individuals are modelled discretely. Unless a vaccine is expected, a prolonged lockdown with an intensity much greater than that required to keep COVID-19 cases within health system capacity, but which is not able to eliminate the infection, is of unclear value. These C-series scenarios are among the worst performing strategies. Smooth, submaximal lockdowns are more effective than pulsatile lockdowns, in terms of epidemiological outcomes and non-epidemiological outcomes. In terms of epidemiological outcomes, the best performing scenario (E3 or E4) is a smooth and constant partial lockdown applied throughout the intervention period. For any given duty cycle (the fraction of one period that a pulsatile lockdown is in force), the equivalent smooth partial lockdown was superior (also see Kissler et al. 2020) . A potential caveat to this would be if certain social or economic activities price 6 It is highly probable, that a scenario involving a prolonged full lockdown to suppress COVID-19 for most of the duration of the simulation would prevent such infections, but this 'path one' strategy (suppress and eliminate local transmission), although perfectly valid, is not the focus of this paper. .

65169,"We analyze the effect of using a screening CT-scan for evaluation of potential COVID-19 infections in order to isolate and perform contact tracing based upon a viral pneumonia diagnosis. RT-PCR is then used for continued isolation based upon a COVID diagnosis. Both the low false negative rates and rapid results of CT-scans lead to dramatically reduced transmission. The reduction in cases after 60 days with widespread use of CT-scan screening compared to PCR by itself is as high as 50x, and the reduction of effective reproduction rate R(t) is 0.20. Our results imply that much more rapid extinction of COVID is possible by combining social distancing with CT-scans and contact tracing."
65242,"COVID-19 is a global challenge where India stands within the first ten affected countries. The share by India to COVID-19 cases may arise in the near future because of its mammoth population size, high population density, and poor public health facilities. The present study provides the national and subnational trajectory of COVID-19 cases, period-prevalence rate, fatality rate and recovery rate in India, over a period of four months, from onset to May 29, 2020 (end of the nationwide fourth lockdown). As of May 29, 2020 (by end of 4 th National lockdown), India has reported a total of 1,73,487 cases, 82,627 recovered and 4,977 deaths from COVID-19 in 37 states and union territories. The national daily new cases observed about 97 percent change over lockdown period; daily infected about 130 percent change; daily recovered about 817 percent change and daily deceased about 139 percent change. Our analysis also revealed that at the national level, there is consistent improvement in CRR over the lockdown period. We also found the CFR was minimal by the end of the fourth lockdown phase. This study also observed that at the national level, the PPR has increased 183 times over four lockdown periods The highest percent change is observed in Bihar (828 times); Tamil Nadu (797 times); Odisha (698 times); Madhya Pradesh (443 times) from first to fourth lockdowns; whereas, the percent change of CRR is the highest in Telangana (15.0 percent change); Tamil Nadu (8 percent change); Rajasthan (5 percent change) and Kerala (2 percent change); from first to third lockdown periods. Most of the states observed a decline in CFR over the lockdown periods. However, three states viz., Maharashtra, West Bengal, and Gujarat have to put more effort as they have high CFR and low recovery rates. Maharashtra also observed the lowest CRR of 17.9 percent on average over lockdown periods. The number of confirmed cases in India is found to be lesser than other countries where lockdown is either not strict or not implemented (Roser, Ritchie, Ortiz-Ospina, & Hasell, 2020) . A study found that lockdown has averted 330 deaths until April 23, 2020 . Thus, lockdown may have played an important role in decelerating the speed. Moreover, it has also given the Government time to prepare for a possible surge in cases, when the pandemic is predicted to peak in the coming weeks. However, PPR rising at an escalated pace (0.4 to 7.5 percent), more importantly in the last two lockdown periods might be due to two possible reasons; firstly, the exercise of testing samples has been intensified by government authorities, which consequently results new cases; secondly, the nation has witnessed huge flux of migrants returning to home states especially from megacities during third and fourth lockdown periods. Moreover, the Home Secretary of India has made some relaxation for the inter-state movement mainly for distressed migrant workers, stranded tourists, pilgrims, and students (GOI, 2020) . The present study observed huge state-level variations among COVID-19 new, total infected, recovered, and deceased cases. Six states (Maharashtra 35.9 percent; Tamil Nadu 11.7 percent; Delhi .

65254,"We set out to understand how the COVID-19 pandemic, and associated lockdown restrictions, impacted individuals with chronic pain in terms of their psychological wellbeing, physical activity levels and pain experience. The findings reveal that people with chronic pain reported self-perceived increases in levels of pain severity during the most stringent period of lockdown in the UK (mid-April to early-May 2020) compared to the period before lockdown. They were more adversely affected by lockdown conditions than pain-free individuals, reporting greater self-perceived increases in anxiety and depressed mood, increased . CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0    "
65257,"This exploratory analysis indicates that social capital and community health are related to the growth rate of COVID-19 cases at the state and county level in the United States, one of the first such studies on the social determinants of infectious disease. We believe the observed correlations are sufficiently strong to motivate further work in this area, such as trying to tease apart causal mechanisms through experimental, quasi-experimental, or advanced statistical methods [23] . Of particular importance for causal understanding going forward is to investigate the relationship between micro-level properties of social interaction networks that will emerge from contact tracing and the area-level notions of social capital considered here. We already see that more residential movement and less retail and recreation movement are associated with area-level notions of social capital and institutional health. Such an understanding of causal mechanisms could be used to inform potential interventions that can 5   ()   increase community health in communities where COVID-19 (and likely future pandemics) risk is high. Note that there is significant variation in U.S. counties with respect to susceptibility to COVID-19, not only with respect to rate of cases, but also disease severity and mortality [24] . Furthermore, it may be important to consider distinctions among communities' associational life in planning social distancing strategies for COVID-19 contagion control in a more nuanced manner. Increased residential mobility index is associated with (c) social capital index (p = 8.14 × 10 −33 , R 2 = 0.103) and (d) institutional health index (p = 2.97 × 10 −30 , R 2 = 0.095).

65258,"This paper presents a generalized mathematical model and several explicit models considering the effects of coronavirus-related restrictions and changes such as reopening states, staying-athome orders and social-distancing practice of different communities along with a set of selected indicators such as the total number of coronavirus recovered cases and new cases in the US and other countries such as Italy and the United Kingdom. The models can predict the daily death toll and total number of deaths in the US related to Covid-19 virus. The models also predict the daily death toll and total number of deaths in Italy and the United Kingdom. The results show very encouraging predictability for the proposed models. The models can serve as a framework to help policy makers a scientific approach in quantifying decision-makings related to Covid-19 affairs. . CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0    "
65323,"In this study, we modeled the mobility dynamics across time during the COVID-19 pandemic. Using this model we computed explanatory features that characterize a lockdown, and in turn, these features provided a quantitative measure for comparing the lockdown dynamics and outcome across countries. We found high correlation between the response time of a country and its mortality rate. This finding suggests that countries that took early measures to limit population mixing had better control on the viral-related mortality. In contrast, neither the lockdown duration nor the lockdown strictness were significantly associated with mortality rates (Supplementary Table S5 ). These results imply that a tight lockdown could have been unnecessary. Official governmental regulations are possible resources for extracting features regarding the lockdown. Such features were examined for their association with infection rates in previous studies 5, 11 . However, the time governmental regulations were declared was often significantly different from the date social distancing initiated de facto 4 . For example, Italy announced regional lockdowns in three phases. Initially, a lockdown was applied in Lombardy and Veneto regions on February 20. This lockdown was expanded to all of Northern Italy on March 8, and finally to a nationwide lockdown on March 11. However, the mobility data show that even though the initial lockdown was declared on Lombardy, mobility volumes across Italy kept . CC-BY 4.0    "
65337,"Graph structure, i.e. the network of who can infect whom, has a decisive effect on the growth of epidemics. Specifically, super-spreaders, or the fat tail of the degree distribution, matter a lot, in addition to the mean degree. The expected number of infections of a random individual, r, in many models equivalent to R 0 , is not a good enough indicator of epidemic spread. It is also obviously not a property of a virus itself, since it depends on many other conditions, such as social, living & hygiene conditions. We showed that the graph structure has a very large influence on the effective reproduction number, R, even when r stays constant, because of dynamics of the epidemic spread. It is therefore crucial to model the graph structure to reach the right conclusions about epidemic spread. . CC-BY 4.0    To compare different policies against each other, we need to explain what the policies are and what outcomes we care about. Let's start with the outcomes. The three main outcomes we'll track here are the following. • Share of the population eventually infected. This is the proportion of individuals who are infected at some point before the epidemic is eradicated. Some fraction of this is the deaths, so this is obviously important. We term a share of fewer than 5% ""containment"". . CC-BY 4.0    In conclusion, there are a few tools at our disposal to decrease the effective reproduction number R below 1 and achieve containment: • Testing symptomatic individuals -helps a lot, but not enough on its own. The faster and more hermetic it is, the more effective it is. • Contact tracing -helps a lot as well. • Social distancing to slow the base rate of spread. • Mass testing -requires a lot of tests to have an effect, so less effective. .

65369,"We propose a new way of estimating the incubation time only from the publicly available epidemiological data of the number of infections. The two advantages of this approach are that the exposure history is not required and in a pandemic one can work with data tens of thousands of infections. In the publicly available data on the number of new infections from different countries, one sees that the number of daily new cases (I(t)) actually increase for a few days (t) after the lockdown (t=0), before they decline. In an ideal scenario, the new cases after lockdown come from the individuals who were infected in the preceding days and after a certain incubation are becoming symptomatic. Thus the number of new infections on day 1, depends on the asymptomatic ones on day 0 (A(0)) and an incubation of 1 day, as well as the ones infected on day -1 and with an incubation of 2 days, and so on. Mathematically, the predicted number of infections I*(t) on day t after the lockdown is Eq (1) where µ(t+t; l,k) represents the distribution of the incubation period which we assume to be a Weibull distribution with parameters l and k, without loss of generality. Convoluting two functions such as in Eq. (1) is a standard approach in the linear response theory. We further assume that on any day prior to the lockdown the number of asymptomatic infections is proportional to the number of reported infections (A(-t) = a.I(-t) ). We performed a linear regression analysis between the infections observed after lockdown I(t) and the predicted ones I*(t) for various choices of l and k ( Figures 1A,B,C) . The values of l and k for which the regression coefficient was the highest was considered the maximum likelihood estimate of the incubation period ( Figure 1D ). We find that the incubation time follows a Weibull distribution of µ(t+t; l,k) with parameters l=16, k=2 best helps the infections before lockdown from Austria, Spain and Germany ( Figure  1D ) to predict the ones after. In working with the epidemiological data, we developed an estimation of the incubation period of the virus in the community, which may in principle be the same as that for the individuals in a perfectly implemented quarantine. In summary, we introduced a new way of estimating the incubation time by studying the new infection that arise after measures that restrict the interactions between the individuals in the community to a minimal or non-existent level. The advantages are that it is easy estimate. The estimates we made for three European countries suggest an incubation time with a median of 13.3 days. Models for public health should consider estimates for incubation time in the community, such as what we introduce here, for a better understanding of the differences between new cases arising after the incubation and the genuinely newer ones. Figure 1 . The daily infections observed after lockdown [11] and the predictions made using the infections before lockdown for: A. Austria (lockdown, 16 March 2020) B. Spain (lockdown, 14 March 2020) C. Germany (lockdown, 21 March 2020) are compared. The data until 13 April 2020 was used. The predictions were made as described with l=16, k=2. D. Similar graphs like A, B, C were generated for l between 5 to 20 to identify the value that best suits the data. l=16 optimizes the Weibull distribution for the data studied. k=2 was used in this analysis. It was independently optimized in the range k=1 to 3. "
65382,"Our model found evidence for reductions in transmission rates of COVID-19 in 42 of 51 examined countries. Encouragingly, of those countries, we found statistical evidence that the transmission of COVID-19 is decreasing in 24 countries, i.e. the effective reproductive number is less than 1, using data up to April, 16, 2020. This suggests that, despite the highly heterogeneous populations represented by these countries, the growth of COVID-19 outbreak can be reverted. Although our model cannot attribute exact causes to the global decline in transmissions rates, most countries implemented sustained, population-level social distancing efforts over a period of weeks to months. These efforts are highly likely to play a major role in reducing the transmission of COVID-19 (5). We estimated that in countries with decreasing transmission, the rate of decrease is in general less than 0.1/day. Based on data from 8 European countries, the US and China, we previously estimated that in the absence of intervention efforts, the epidemic can grow at rates between 0.19-0.29/day (2) . This means that the outbreak can grow rapidly and avert public heath efforts made if social distancing measures are completely relaxed. For example, if the rate of decrease under strong public health interventions is 0.1/day and the growth rate in the absence of public heath interventions is 0.2/day, then, the number of cases averted in two weeks of intervention will be regained in only one week. Social distancing measures have their own social costs. Our results suggests alternative strategies to control the virus are needed in place when social distancing efforts are relaxed. Due to the uncertainties in the impact of each specific control measures, changes to policies should be made slowly because the signal of changing transmission can take weeks to fully propagate into current data streams as a result of the long lag between infection to case confirmation (as we estimated to be approximately 2 weeks). "
65409,"In this paper, we focused on decisions by governors, who through the structure of US and state constitutions and the abdication of presidential leadership found themselves on the frontlines of the battle against COVID-19. Future research should consider the role of local governments, but in March 2020, it was often governors who led their states -or allowed them to fall behind. Why do Republican governors and states with Republican voters seem to resist social distancing policy, even controlling for many potential confounders? We strongly believe that realistic assessments of decision-making by elected officials must take electoral motivations and career ambitions seriously -as impolitic as that may be. Elected officials, regardless of party, must be responsive to the concerns of their voters and party leaders. However this essential feature of democratic representation does not inevitably produce the best policy outcome. Where the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic were concerned, Republicans had fewer incentives to act quickly than Democrats. First, "
65440,"Temperature and pollution are weather factors that could affect the spread of SARS-CoV-2. This study used the most reliable data, deaths, and a strong statistical model at the county level to estimate the impact of these factors. During March, April, and May of 2020, when the average minimum temperature within a five-day window increased by one degree Fahrenheit, daily death in northern U.S. counties increased by about 5.1%. In addition, when ozone concentration rised by one ppb, daily death in southern U.S. counties increases by about 2.0%. No evidence of an effect of maximum temperature, precipitation, PM2.5, and UV light on COVID-19 deaths was found. The absence of evidence, however, is not evidence of absence. These results were robust to the specification and to the inclusion and exclusion of variables. The impact of minimum temperature on COVID-19 deaths is thought to be . CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0    "
65444,"By analyzing the 247 cases in Singapore with relatively detailed data, we estimated the average efficiency of contact tracing and self-awareness in early stage. By dividing the local cases into five different classes. We found that in addition to cutting off infection spreading from those cases in Class 1 altogether, close contact tracing and self-awareness helped reduce the delay from onset to isolation by an average of 2-4 days for those cases belonging to Classes 2-4, which helped reduce the average number of secondary cases. Based on our model, we estimated the basic reproduction number in Singapore to be likely between 2 and 2.5 unless there is a large portion of asymptomatic cases. This is evidenced by the reasonably good match between simulation results and ground truth. By introducing social distancing in stage 2, the non-tracing reproduction number ( ,2 ) may have been reduced to be about 1.9 or slightly lower. Singapore's experiences show that close contact tracing and self-awareness combined together may achieve effective control of the epidemic spreading when the number of infected cases is low. A booming number of imported cases, together with a degraded performance of contact tracing and self-awareness such a booming number may easily lead to, may quickly drive disease spreading from being under control to a dangerous outbreak. It is shown that, in order to stop the disease spreading in stage 3, CBM and other control schemes need to be imposed to push down the non-tracing reproduction number ( ,3 ) to be lower than 1.5 if contact tracing and self-awareness remain as effectively as before, or even lower with degraded contract tracing and self-awareness. The above discussions indicate that contact tracing and self-awareness must be enhanced . CC-BY 4.0    "
65451,"Given the global impact of emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases, a number of methods have been developed to estimate and analyse the basic reproductive number R0, which is the hallmark of infectious diseases transmission (Blumberg & Lloyd-Smith, 2013) , the most used approaches are based on four factor; i. the contact frequency, ii. the contact efficacy (both i & ii form the effective contact rate), in addition to; iii. the susceptible population size and iv. the infectious phase duration. However, these four parameters require time and numerous studies to be identified correctly, thus, in case of global emergencies such as the COVID-19 pandemic, we need quick results to assess the situation and the taken measures, especially in low and middle income countries where people in general are most affected. Our assessment was mainly based on the evolution of R0, which was daily estimated using equation 2, taking as baseline prevalence 7 days before, we did not use the previous day prevalence to avoid variations due to postponement of cases declarations. Monitoring of R0's variations during the epidemic shows a remarkable progressive decrease over the last weeks (Fig.2) , as mentioned in the results part, the highest R0 was recorded the second week at the national level and in Blida 4,26 (95% CI 2,65-5,88), and 3,28 (95% CI 2,28-4,27), respectively, as regards to outside Blida, the highest R0 equal 3.2 (95% CI 2,44-3,95) was reported two weeks later on the 4 th week. This is obviously due to the fact that the main outbreak occurred in Blida then spread outside. On April 03, 2020, the effectiveness of the preventive actions has started to appear 12 days after their implementation ( Fig.1.a.b.c) , this observation is consistent with a previous study reported .

65478,"We evaluate the effect of measures based on the deployment of a digital contact tracing app on the mitigation of the Covid-19 pandemic. As we do not consider geography nor large-scale mobility, our modeling can be considered as referring to a limited geographical area, similarly to previous modeling efforts. 1, 35 In particular, we assume that two types of interventions are possible to limit the spread of the virus. In this study, we have analyzed the ability of digital tracing policies to contain the spread of Covid-19 outbreaks, using real interaction datasets to extract the main effective parameters and to shed light on the practical consequences of the implementation of various app policies. We found that the set of parameters that allow containment of the spread is strongly restricted by the fraction of asymptomatic cases. By first assuming an ideal setting where any pair of parameters ε I , ε T is possible, we showed ( Figure 3 ) that perfect contact and isolation policies are required if only symptomatic people can be detected and a realistic fraction of asymptomatic cases (40%) is assumed. We have thus assumed in addition that 50% of the asymptomatic can be detected by randomized testing (see Figure 5 ). We remark that this is in contrast with the scenario considered in Fraser et al. 3 and in Ferretti et al., 1 where all the infected population is eventually assumed to become symptomatic. We tested five policies to define risky contacts that should be traced (Table 1) , with different restriction levels. When implemented on real contact data measured by Bluetooth, they allow us to estimate, for each value of ε I , the actual value of ε T and thus to determine the efficacy of each policy (colored points in Figure 5 ). Using these implementations on real data restricts the available values of the control parameters and, as a consequence, only the most restrictive policies lead to epidemic containment. "
65479,"The latter half of the pandemic in Italy was not finished and lockdown measures were still in place at the time of writing this paper. Since most systematic surveillance, at least in the early phase of the pandemic has, in most countries, occurred in the hospital context, the typical delay from infection to hospitalisation means there is a 2 to 3 week lag between interventions being introduced and the impact being reflected in the reported caseload 9 . Thus, any benefits in regions where lockdown was applied greater than 10 days into the epidemic were likely to be minimal before the peak but could have extended beyond the peak into the latter half of the epidemic. However, it is clear from these results that early lockdown and the attendant mitigating factors that preceded lockdown resulted in a . CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0    "
65492,"Non-Pharmaceutical Interventions (NPI) are currently the only mechanism governments can use to mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 epidemic. Similarly to the actual spread of the disease, the dynamics of the contention patterns emerging from the application of NPIs are complex and depend on interactions between people within a specific region as well as other stochastic factors associated to demographic, geographic, political and economical conditions. Agent-based models simulate microscopic rules of simultaneous spatial interactions between multiple agents within a population, in an attempt to reproduce the complex dynamics of the effect of the contention measures. In this way, it is possible to design individual behaviours along with NPI scenarios, measuring how the simulation dynamics is affected and therefore, yielding rapid insights to perform a broad assessment of the potential of composite interventions at different stages of the epidemic. In this paper we describe a model and a tool to experiment with such kind of analysis applied to a conceptual city, considering a number of widely-applied NPIs such as social distancing, case isolation, home quarantine, total lockdown, sentinel testing, mask wearing and a distinctive ""zonal"" enforcement measure, requiring these interventions to be applied gradually to separated enclosed districts (zones). We find that the model is able to capture emerging dynamics associated to these NPIs; besides, the zonal contention strategy yields an improvement on the mitigation impact across all scenarios of combination with individual NPIs. The model and tool are open to extensions to account for omitted or newer factors affecting the planning and design of NPIs intended to counter the late stages or forthcoming waves of the COVID-19 crisis."
65518,"We assessed, at a standardized stage of the outbreak at 100 cases, the impact of physical distancing measures on COVID-19 transmission, measured by R t , and found that, on average, they have been effective in reducing R t -if the measures were sufficiently stringent and implemented early. By using R t as the primary metric of transmission, instead of cumulative case counts in other similar studies (Castex .

Although modelling studies have shown the importance of physical distancing in stemming disease spread, few empirical studies have validated this finding. We provide empirical support and quantified the impact of physical distancing measures in lowering the reproduction number, particularly lockdowntype measures and border closures. Moreover, we found that less stringent lockdown-type measures, such as encouraging working from home and staying home unless necessary were as effective as complete lockdowns in reducing transmission. However, all these measures have to be implemented early to be effective. As many countries are in the midst of de-escalating, we suggest that some combination of these measures-empirically justified-should be considered in containing subsequent waves of COVID-19. .

However, 2 weeks later, the R i showed a very impressive decline, reaching < 1.5 for the majority of brazillian states. This probably is a direct consequence of control measures instituted by local governments (social distancing, quarantine, lockdown). Furthermore, the highest R i initial values correlated with the states that experienced high infection rates, like AM (Amazonas), RJ (Rio de Janeiro), and CE (Ceará). In this study, we used incidence data to derive R i and looked at brazillian states specific COVID-19 infection dynamics. In a model incorporating multiple variables, instantaneous R sensitively described real-time shifts of COVID-19 incidence, and varied accordingly with epidemic phase. Superspreading events were associated with R i with high values, tipically much higher than 2, as well as rapid epidemic growth phases. In contrast, epidemic decline stage was characterized by R i < 2 (Bandoy and Weimer, 2020). The data on estimated R i points to specific differences between different states. Some graphs exhibit spikes, like BA (Bahia) or ES (Espírito Santo) that may correlate with non compliance with control measures. Alternatively, local dynamics could play a role in determining R i variation between different brazillian regions. Even in those regions that depicted variable behavior and R i spikes, however, the trend was towards decreasing values and, therefore, less viral spread. The basic reproduction number R 0 is the expected number of infections caused by an individual in the absence of widespread immunity. Once widespread immunity is achieved, the effective reproduction number R will become lower than R 0 and once R is less than 1, the population is said to have developed herd immunity and the epidemic declines. Immunity can only be obtained with certainty by vaccination, and a vaccine or effective treatment is not expected to be available soon. The best (and only) strategy right now is to rely on social distancing measures until a sustained epidemic suppression (R < 1) could be attained (Ferretti et al., 2020) . Instantaneous R estimating showed to be a convenient way to investigate epidemic dynamics. The COVID-19 pandemic figures in Brazil indicate a trend towards the amellioration of the epidemic. However, this is heavily dependent upon regional governments decisions and politics. There is a high risk of new viral spread if the control measures are precociously eased. Authorities must take this into account and decide wisely upon social restrictions in the next few weeks, because they may be critical in this scenario. "

65718,"The demand for assessment of methods of control for COVID-19 in South Africa is overwhelming. Understanding the impact of these control measures requires knowledge and expertise drawn from various scientific disciplines including mathematical modelling. The role of mathematical models' insights formed the national response to the pandemic. The idea of social distancing in order to flatten the epidemic growth curve, thus allowing time to prepare for the worst case scenarios, was drawn from mathematical models for the COVID-19 epidemic. This was critical in preventing as many deaths as possible. We presented a deterministic model to assess the impact of social distancing on the transmission dynamics of COVID-19 in South Africa taking into account the initial imported cases before the lockdown in the early phase of infection. The model fitted well to the South African cumulative cases data leading to an appropriate estimation of the optimal model-based parameter estimates for South Africa. Insights gained from the current study contributes impacts the current levels of intervention using social distancing in South Africa. The results suggest that individuals migrating into South Africa played an important role in driving the infection in South Africa and the prevention of infections happening elsewhere on the globe needs special attention due to improved mobility of humans.

65757,"Individual-based control efforts of COVID-19 can be challenging to implement due to the high infectiousness, relatively mild and moderate symptoms and pre symptomatic transmission [23] [24] [25] . Consequently, social distancing measures are required to control COVID-19 in most scenarios. Here, we demonstrated that the initial social distancing measures adopted by the states of São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro successfully reduced R(t) < 1 by decreasing mobility across 15 populations with lower and higher development index. We further demonstrated a strong correlation between the social isolation index and R(t), and showed that isolation indexs above 50% lead to R(t)<1 in most cases (89%). Our findings suggest that the isolation index can be used to monitor the effectiveness of social distancing measures and guide further interventions. By using aggregated mobility data, public health officials and policymakers can monitor in real 20 time regional differences in social distancing intervention effectiveness and propose specific actions to reduce the transmission in specific locations(20). .

However, we did not find evidence on the effectiveness of standalone and partial measures such as the non-essential business closures implemented on March 16 on the COVID-19 spread reduction. The findings regarding the effectiveness of strict social distancing shelter-in-place measures corroborate and give context to the existing evidence on Greece's success in containing the spread of the virus and suggest that the rapid governmental response had the desired outcome on flattening the outbreak's growth curve.

65846,"Background: In May 2020, many European countries have begun to introduce an exit strategy for the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic which involves relaxing social distancing measures. Predictive epidemiological modeling indicates that chances for resurgence are high. However, parametrization of the epidemiological nature of COVID-19 and the effect of relaxing social distancing is not well constrained, resulting in highly uncertain outcomes in view of managing future intensive care unit (ICU) needs. Methods and findings: For performance analysis of exit strategies we developed an open-source ensemble-based Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Removed (SEIR) model. It takes into account uncertainties for the COVID-19 parametrization and social distancing measures. The model is calibrated to data of the outbreak and lockdown phase. For the exit phase, the model includes the capability to activate an emergency brake, reinstating lockdown conditions. Alternatively, the model uses an adaptive COVID-19 cruise control (ACCC) capable to retain a targeted ICU level. The model is demonstrated for the Netherlands and we analyzed progressive and adaptive exit strategies through a stress test of managing ICU rates. The progressive strategy reflects the outcome of social and economic pressure to use one-way steering toward progressively relaxing measures at an early stage. It is marked by a high probability for the activation of the emergency brake due to an unsolicited growth of ICU needs in the following months. Alternatively, the two-way steering ACCC can flatten ICU needs in a more gradual way and avoids activation of the emergency brake. It also performs well for seasonal variation in the reproduction number of severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus. Conclusions: The adaptive strategy (ACCC) is favored, as it avoids the use of the emergency brake at the expense of small steps of restrictive measures and allows the exploration of riskier and potentially rewarding measures in the future pathways of the exit strategy."
65861,"Background: China adopted an unprecedented province-scale quarantine since January 23rd 2020, after the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) broke out in Wuhan in December 2019. Responding to the challenge of limited testing capacity, large-scale standardized and fully-automated laboratory (Huo-Yan) was built as an ad-hoc measure. There was so far no empirical data or mathematical model to reveal the impact of the testing capacity improvement since the quarantine. Methods: We integrated public data released by the Health Commission of Hubei Province and Huo-Yan Laboratory testing data into a novel differential model with non-linear transfer coefficients and competitive compartments, to evaluate the trends of suspected cases under different nucleic acid testing capacities. Results: Without the establishment of Huo-Yan, the suspected cases would increased by 47% to 33,700, the corresponding cost of the quarantine would be doubled, and the turning point of the increment of suspected cases and the achievement of ""daily settlement"" (all daily new discovered suspected cases were diagnosed according to the nucleic acid testing results) would be delayed for a whole week and 11 days. If the Huo-Yan Laboratory could ran at its full capacity, the number of suspected cases could started to decrease at least a week earlier, the peak of suspected cases would be reduced by at least 44% and the quarantine cost could be reduced by more than 72%. Ideally, if a daily testing capacity of 10,500 could achieved immediately after the Hubei lockdown, ""daily settlement"" for all suspected cases would be achieved immediately. Conclusions: Large-scale and standardized clinical testing platform with nucleic acid testing, high-throughput sequencing and immunoprotein assessment capabilities need to be implemented simultaneously in order to maximize the effect of quarantine and minimize the duration and cost. Such infrastructure like Huo-Yan, is of great significance for the early prevention and control of infectious diseases for both common times and emergencies."
65870,"COVID-19 is a global epidemic. Till now, there is no remedy for this epidemic. However, isolation and social distancing are seemed to be effective to control this pandemic. In this paper, we provide an analytical model on the effectiveness of the sustainable lockdown policy that accommodates both isolation and social distancing features of the individuals. To promote social distancing, we analyze a noncooperative game environment that provides an incentive for maintaining social distancing. Furthermore, the sustainability of the lockdown policy is also interpreted with the help of a game-theoretic incentive model for maintaining social distancing. Finally, an extensive numerical analysis is provided to study the impact of maintaining a social-distancing measure to prevent the Covid-19 outbreak. Numerical results show that the individual incentive increases more than 85% with an increasing percentage of home isolation from 25% to 100% for all considered scenarios. The numerical results also demonstrate that in a particular percentage of home isolation, the individual incentive decreases with an increasing number of individuals."
65886,"We have used network models to interpret the dynamics of COVID19 spread during and after social distancing measures. The network models can account for two observations that cannot be easily reproduced with ODE-based SIR models: They predict that the infection spreads according to a power law, and further predict the presence of a prolonged plateau phase following the start of non-pharmaceutical intervention measures, if those are implemented relatively early during the epidemic. According to the network models, the plateau occurs because during strict social distancing, infection spread follows nearly one-dimensional transmission corridors, compared to spread in two dimensions before distancing. Another interesting finding was that according to the model, the plateau phase naturally transitions into a decline phase without any further increase in non-pharmaceutical intervention measures. If . CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0    Our results further emphasize some important differences between ODE and networkbased modeling. While the traditional SIR ODE modeling paradigm is capable of reproducing many features of network infection dynamics, some aspects are not captured by the simplified . CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0    ()  .   ODE framework. For example, the shape of the infection growth is not correctly predicted by the ODEs, which becomes especially apparent from the absence of the plateau dynamics during interventions in ODEs. Further, ODE models suggest that the lower the infectivity parameter during the intervention, the higher the second infection wave and the resulting final epidemic size. This result is a consequence of the complete mixing assumption and it is weakened or disappears under a network modeling approach. It is important to note that model results depend on model assumptions and that uncertainties remain in this regard. While we think that network models are more realistic descriptions of infection spread during non-pharmaceutical interventions than ordinary differential equations that assume perfect mixing, uncertainty remains about the exact contact structure in our societies, which can also differ from location to location (e.g. comparing urban with rural areas). It appears, however, that our results depend on the notion that cutting network connections can transform virus spread in 2 dimensions towards spread paths that are more one-dimensional in nature. It might be possible to test this notion with more detailed data on human contacts during social distancing. Another source of uncertainty comes from the data that we are interpreting. While a wealth of information exists about confirmed COVID190 case counts in the US and around the world, these counts depend on testing levels, making it hard to compare different locations. The observation that a plateau is observed could in principle also be explained by the limited availability of tests as true infection levels rise. This is unlikely to be the case, however, given . CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0    ()  .   that the percent of positive tests is typically not near saturation. If we assume that the observed plateau dynamics reflect a real plateau of infection levels during social distancing, we conclude that network models can account for these details of the dynamics in a more accurate way than models based on ordinary differential equations. .

65989,"Network models are frequently used in simulation of neural and cognitive processes, and are a quite realistic modelling strategy for the dynamics of a complex collectivity, as they simulate dynamic information and energy flows through the connection matrix between Network units (Haykin, 1994) . With adequate parameters, a network model virtually behaves as a real life population. In order to simulate realistic scenarios, which have an intrinsic non-linear nature, we used here generators of stochastic numbers: raffles shall always be required to define who is connected to whom and with what intensity. In this application, elucidating behavior patterns of the simulated collectivity occurs by empirical observation of the progression of this interconnected collectivity. In this case, the non-linearity is in the connection matrices (which are here interpreted as the likelihood of subjects being contaminated). Therefore, we worked with output samples, derived from simulations with different ""patients zero"". Model validity was checked by a comparative analysis of behavior characteristics previously determined for the population and for the scenario that are intended for simulation. In other words, one way to prove the representativity of the model is comparing the coefficient of exponential growth of the incidence curve obtained with the incidence curve estimated for the actual epidemic. Adopting R0 values found in literature (Sanche et al., 2020) in this model (Ma et al, 2013) , we obtained incidence curves that fit (best-fit) an exponential with growth rate parameters that are nearly the same as those of the actual incidence curve. Using the exponential model (equation 4), we found r of 0.16 and 0.28, respectively, for R0 equal to 2.7 and 5.7, inside or near the respective intervals previously estimated for these R0 (Sanche et al, 2020) . Therefore, this model might be considered representative of the progression of an epidemic such as that of Even considering this model realistic and representative of the COVID-19 epidemic behavior, these simulations did not determine ideal parameters of lockdown coverage and time. Due to its validity, this model might possibly be useful for quantitative estimates in further studies . CC-BY 4.0    "
66021,"Overall, our study results show that the COVID-19 pandemic in India in the absence of any intervention is likely to affect a large proportion of India's population, which has huge implications for the health system in terms of scaling-up its capacity. Our results, in terms of proportion of total population likely to be eventually get infected, exposure rate at the peak of the epidemic, 28 The recently released report by the mathematical modelling group at the Imperial College on COVID-19, estimates 7 billion population (89%) globally to be infected by the end of the current pandemic, which will lead to 40 million deaths. The Australian modelling study demonstrates that, with no intervention the epidemic would peak around mid-May and almost 50% of the population would be affected. In terms of impact of case isolation (1-week delay in peak), school closures (2-week delay in peak) and social distancing with a compliance of 70% or less, there is just a delay in peak achieved with no significant reduction in number of cases. If the compliance is more than 70%, there may be reduction in incidence and prevalence but the epidemic is expected to resurge once these measures are taken off. 35 We have also observed similar findings from our present study for India. Another recent study shows that lockdown for 3-weeks only delays the onset of peak rather than mitigating the epidemic. 4 However, our study adds to the existing evidence in trying to clearly sync scenarios with emerging policy questions, as well as estimating the health system preparedness in terms of augmentation of infrastructure as well as cost. The Government of India has currently relaxed the lockdown after a period of 8-weeks, which ended on 17 th May, 2020. The findings of our study also validate the steps taken by the Indian Government to use the lockdown to buy time for preparing the health system. The number of laboratories performing testing for COVID-19 has increased from 52 to 484 within a short period of 65 days. 36,37 Strategies for pooling of samples is being adopted to enhance the geographical barriers.

66042,"Expectations that about 70 percent of people may be infected before containing the pandemic were implicitly based on assuming population homogeneity. Contrary to those expectations, we show that the population heterogeneity may bring that threshold level down to as few as 14 percent with a similar basic reproduction number. Population heterogeneity, it appears, may even outweigh the vaccination in its importance as a factor checking the spread of the disease. We urgently need to fully understand the extent and nature of how people differ in susceptibility to the infection and the ability to spread it and appreciate that in our decision-making. In the long run, a lower number of people infected means fewer causalities to the virus. In the short run, however, lockdown policies around the world take the capacity of the healthcare system into account too. In that context, it is notable that population . CC-BY 4.0    "
66065,"Social distancing measures, with varying degrees of restriction, have been imposed around the world in order to stem the spread of COVID-19. In this work we analyze the effect of current social distancing measures in the United States. We quantify the reduction in doubling rate, by state, that is associated with social distancing. We find that social distancing is associated with a statistically-significant reduction in the doubling rate for all but three states. At the same time, we do not find significant evidence that social distancing has resulted in a reduction in the number of daily confirmed cases. Instead, social distancing has merely stabilized the spread of the disease. We provide an illustration of our findings for each state, including point estimates of the effective reproduction number, R, both with and without social distancing. We also discuss the policy implications of our findings."
66138,"Countries around the world are in a state of lockdown to help limit the spread of SARS-CoV-2. However, as the number of new daily confirmed cases begins to decrease, governments must decide how to release their populations from quarantine as efficiently as possible without overwhelming their health services. We applied an optimal control framework to an adapted Susceptible-Exposure-Infection-Recovery (SEIR) model framework to investigate the efficacy of two potential lockdown release strategies, focusing on the UK population as a test case. To limit recurrent spread, we find that ending quarantine for the entire population simultaneously is a high-risk strategy, and that a gradual re-integration approach would be more reliable. Furthermore, to increase the number of people that can be first released, lockdown should not be ended until the number of new daily confirmed cases reaches a sufficiently low threshold. We model a gradual release strategy by allowing different fractions of those in lockdown to re-enter the working non-quarantined population. Mathematical optimisation methods, combined with our adapted SEIR model, determine how to maximise those working while preventing the health service from being overwhelmed. The optimal strategy is broadly found to be to release approximately half the population two-to-four weeks from the end of an initial infection peak, then wait another three-to-four months to allow for a second peak before releasing everyone else. We also modelled an ''on-off'' strategy, of releasing everyone, but re-establishing lockdown if infections become too high. We conclude that the worst-case scenario of a gradual release is more manageable than the worst-case scenario of an on-off strategy, and caution against lockdown-release strategies based on a threshold-dependent on-off mechanism. The two quantities most critical in determining the optimal solution are transmission rate and the recovery rate, where the latter is defined as the fraction of infected people in any given day that then become classed as recovered. We suggest that the accurate identification of these values is of particular importance to the ongoing monitoring of the pandemic."
66173,"Since the emerging of the ""novel coronavirus"" SARS-CoV-2 and the corresponding respiratory disease COVID-19, the virus has spread all over the world. In Europe, Germany is currently one of the most affected countries. In March 2020, a ""lockdown"" was established to contain the virus spread, including the closure of schools and child day care facilities as well as forced social distancing and bans of any public gathering. The present study attempts to analyze whether these governmental interventions had an impact on the declared aim of ""flattening the curve"", referring to the epidemic curve of new infections. This analysis is conducted from a regional perspective. On the level of the 412 German counties, logistic growth models were estimated based on reported cases of infections, aiming at determining the regional growth rate of infections and the point of inflection where infection rates begin to decrease and the curve flattens. All German counties exceeded the peak of new infections between the beginning of March and the middle of April. In a large majority of German counties, the epidemic curve has flattened before the social ban was established (March 23). In a minority of counties, the peak was already exceeded before school closures. The growth rates of infections vary spatially depending on the time the virus emerged. Counties belonging to states which established an additional curfew show no significant improvement with respect to growth rates and mortality. On the contrary, growth rates and mortality are significantly higher in Bavaria compared to whole Germany. The results raise the question whether social ban measures and curfews really contributed to the curve flattening. Furthermore, mortality varies strongly across German counties, which can be attributed to infections of people belonging to the ""risk group"", especially residents of retirement homes."

Here, we use mobility and case data to quantify how coordinated exit strategies could delay continental resurgence and limit community transmission of COVID-19. We find that a resurgent continental epidemic could occur as many as 5 weeks earlier when well-connected countries with stringent existing interventions end their interventions prematurely. Further, we found that appropriate coordination can greatly improve the likelihood of eliminating community transmission throughout Europe. In particular, synchronizing intermittent lockdowns across Europe meant half as many lockdown periods were required to end community transmission continent-wide."
66233,"In the paper we present an SEIR model with Asymptomatic and Quarantined compartments to describe the recent and ongoing COVID-19 outbreak. Our model is intended to highlight the strength of three different non-pharmaceutical interventions imposed by public policies in containing the outbreak and the total number of disease-induced infections and deaths: -reduction of contact rate for a given portion of the population; -enforced quarantine for confirmed infectious individuals; -testing among the population to detect also asymptomatic infectious individuals. On one hand we show that, as expected, each of these interventions has a beneficial impact on flattening the curve of the outbreak. On the other hand, the comparison among different scenarios shows the remarkable efficacy of an early massive testing approach, when the limited number of infected individuals makes easier and more effective the tracing of recent contacts of the individual, as in Scenario D 1 , and of a timely lockdown, although in the presence of few confirmed infected cases, as in Scenario C 1 . In both situations, the timing of the intervention plays a crucial role on the incisiveness of the public safety policy. In addition, we give an explicit representation of the basic reproduction number in terms of the several parameters of the model, which allows to describe its dependence on the features of the virus and on the implemented non-pharmaceutical interventions. This description makes available a valuable tool to tune the public policies in order to control the outbreak of the epidemic, forcing R 0 below the threshold 1. However, considering the major effects of an enduring lockdown on the economy of the country that applies it, it is desirable to loosen the lockdown measures after the containment of the outbreak. Nevertheless, the decision makers and each individual shall be aware that a value of R 0 only barely greater than 1 would lead to an increase in the number of infected and dead by an order 2 of magnitude, thus provoking the collapse of the relative national health system. This is better explained by the following scenarios: consider a situation with constant testing ρ = 0.05 and no lockdown where, after the first 35 days of outbreak with a high R 0 (≈ 2), the population gains awareness of the risk and manage to reduce its contact 17 .

66241,"We approached the model with a simulation based approach; this is computationally intensive but still manageable by most software and hardware and less demanding than stochastic models based on individual data, and allows for a high degree of customizability by fine-tuning its parameters on specific interventions. The model constitutes a viable framework to monitor epidemic trends and assess the effect of interventions. Our results show that (1) voluntary selfquarantine based on contact-tracing apps, together with efficient case isolation, can give a relevant, and in some scenarios decisive, contribution to epidemics mitigation/suppression; (2) at the same time, the success of this strategy can depend heavily on population density and transportation. "
66245,"In this work we present an analysis of the two major strategies currently implemented around the world in the fight against COVID-19: Social distancing & shelter-in-place measures to protect the susceptible, and testing & contact-tracing to identify, isolate and treat the infected. The majority of countries have principally relied on the former; we consider the examples of Italy, Canada and the United States. By fitting a disease transmission model to daily case report data, we infer that in each of the three countries, the current level of national shutdown is equivalent to about half the population being under quarantine. We demonstrate that in the absence of other measures, scaling back social distancing in such a way as to prevent a second wave will take prohibitively long. In contrast, South Korea, a country that has managed to control and suppress its outbreak principally through mass testing and contact tracing, and has only instated a partial shutdown. For all four countries, we estimate the level of testing which would be required to allow a complete exit from shutdown and a full lifting of social distancing measures, without a resurgence of COVID-19. We find that a ""brute-force"" approach of untargeted universal testing requires an average testing rate of once every 36 to 48 hours for every individual, depending on the country. If testing is combined with contact tracing, and/or if tests are able to identify latent infection, then an average rate of once every 4 to 5 days is sufficient."

A calibration process is executed through the solution of an inverse problem with the help of a Trust-Region-Reflective algorithm, used to determine the best parameter values that would fit the model response. The purpose of this study is to give a tentative prediction of the epidemic peak for Russia, Brazil, India and Bangladesh which could become the next COVID-19 hotspots in no time. Based on the publicly available epidemiological data from late January until 10 May, it has been estimated that the number of daily new symptomatic infectious cases for the above mentioned countries could reach the peak around the beginning of June with the peak size of {approx}15,774 symptomatic infectious cases in Russia, {approx}26,449 cases in Brazil, {approx}9,504 cases in India and {approx}2,209 cases in Bangladesh. Based on our analysis, the estimated value of the basic reproduction number (R0) as of May 11, 2020 was found to be {approx}4.234 in Russia, {approx}5.347 in Brazil, {approx}5.218 in India, {approx}4.649 in the United Kingdom and {approx}3.5 in Bangladesh. Moreover, with an aim to quantify the uncertainty of our model parameters, Latin hypercube sampling-partial rank correlation coefficient (LHS-PRCC) which is a global sensitivity analysis (GSA) method is applied which elucidates that, for Russia, the recovery rate of undetected asymptomatic carriers, the rate of getting home-quarantined or self-quarantined and the transition rate from quarantined class to susceptible class are the most influential parameters, whereas the rate of getting home-quarantined or self-quarantined and the inverse of the COVID-19 incubation period are highly sensitive parameters in Brazil, India, Bangladesh and the United Kingdom which could significantly affect the transmission dynamics of the novel coronavirus. Our analysis also suggests that relaxing social distancing restrictions too quickly could exacerbate the epidemic outbreak in the above mentioned countries."

However, lockdown and shutdown interventions have caused new social problems and designating policy resumption for infection control when reopening society remains a crucial issue. We investigated the effects of different resumption strategies on COVID-19 transmission using a modeling study setting. We employed a susceptible-exposed-infectious-removed model to simulate COVID-19 outbreaks under five reopening strategies based on the business resumption progress in China. The effect of each strategy was evaluated using the peak values of the epidemic curves with respect to confirmed active cases and cumulative cases. We found that a hierarchy-based reopen strategy performed best when current epidemic prevention measures were maintained save for lockdown, reducing the peak number of active cases and cumulative cases by 50% and 44%, respectively. However, the modeled effect of each strategy decreased when the current intervention was lifted somewhat. Additional attention should be given to regions with significant numbers of migrants, as the potential risk of COVID-19 outbreaks amid society reopening is intrinsically high. Business resumption strategies have the potential to eliminate COVID-19 outbreaks amid society reopening without special control measures. The proposed resumption strategies focused mainly on decreasing the number of imported exposure cases, guaranteeing medical support for epidemic control, or decreasing active cases."
66328,"In March and April 2020, control measures enforcing social distancing and restricting individual movement and contact were adopted across the United States in an effort to slow the spread and growth of COVID-19. However, a number of states have now begun to ease these restrictions. Here, we evaluate the effects of loosening stay-at-home orders on COVID-19 incidence and related outcomes. We use a metapopulation model applied at county resolution to simulate the spread and growth of COVID-19 incidence in the United States. We calibrate the model against county-level daily case and death data collected from February 21, 2020 to May 2, 2020, and project the outbreak in 3,142 US counties for 6 weeks into the future. Projections for daily reported cases, daily new infections (both reported and unreported), new and cumulative hospital bed demand, ICU bed and ventilator demand, as well as daily mortality, are generated. We observe a rebound in COVID-19 incidence and deaths beginning in late May, approximately 2 to 4 weeks after states begin to reopen. Importantly, the lag between infection acquisition and case confirmation, coupled with insufficient broader testing and contact tracing, will mask any rebound and exponential growth of the COVID-19 until it is well underway."

We found that 3% of individuals who answered the questionnaire reported some difference in their hearing ability. This includes both and negative abilities. We found these results reflected in the molecular pathway of melanocortin receptors 1 and 4, where their knocking out their negative agonist; Asip resulted in upregulating various hearing associated genes such as Fat2 among others. We also noticed that of the genes associated with hearing affected by knocking out of Asip is Slc6a5 and IL33, which showed upregulation; both these genes were associated with startle disease. We investigated Asip further and we found that it is expressed in cochlear sensory epithelial cells. From an evolutionary point of view, Asip is more recent than melanocortin receptors. Taken together, our results suggest that Asip divergence represent the evolution of new mechanism linking hearing and aggression in higher animals. "

Results show that while anxiety levels have gradually declined, there has been little improvement in depression. Adults with pre-existing diagnoses of mental illness had higher levels of anxiety and depression over this period. However, there was little evidence of substantially widening inequalities in mental health experiences over lockdown amongst those with and without existing mental illness. The study did not use a random population sample, and therefore our reported statistics are not presented as prevalence levels for anxiety or depression. It is notable that the averages for both anxiety and depression appear higher than previously reported averages in nationally-representative samples of other western countries such as the US 22, 23 . This echoes reports from other studies in the UK and internationally [24] [25] [26] . But it remains for future representative studies to confirm relative population levels of mental illness. However, this study does give detailed time series data on trajectories of mental health during lockdown. Several surveys have suggested that mental health worsened in the lead up to lockdown [11] [12] [13] [14] 16 , and the results presented here suggest that there has been little tangible improvement in the weeks immediately following lockdown. This is echoed by mood data showing little improvement over the same period, particularly in happiness (see Supplementary Figure 1 ) 11, 12 . The fact that levels of mental health did not continue to worsen even further in this period suggests a process of adaptation that bears similarities to literature on other types of isolation such as incarceration, where some studies have shown that depression levels can stabilise and even decrease on average month on month as new coping strategies emerge 27 . Alternatively, it is also possible that measures to safeguard jobs and finances taken in the UK may have helped to settle specific anxieties. The lockdown itself may also have reduced worries about individuals or their friends or families catching the virus, . CC-BY 4.0    "
66392,"Using a model of setting-specific interactions, we estimated that strategies that combined isolation of symptomatic cases and tracing of their contacts reduced the effective reproduction number more than mass testing or self-isolation alone. The effectiveness of these isolation and tracing strategies was further enhanced when combined with physical distancing measures, such as a reduction in work contacts, or a limit to the number of contacts made outside of home, school or work settings. Several countries have achieved a prolonged suppression of SARS-CoV-2 transmission using a combination of case isolation, contact tracing and physical distancing. In Hong Kong, isolation of cases and tracing of contacts was combined with other physical distancing measures, which resulted in an estimated effective reproduction number near 1 throughout February and March 2020 (10) . As well as early surveillance and containment measures (2) , Singapore introduced additional 'circuit breaker' interventions to counter growing case numbers in April 2020 (23) . In South Korea, testing and tracing has been combined with school closures and remote working (24,25) . In our analysis, we estimated that a large number of contacts would need to be traced and tested if incidence of symptomatic cases was high. This logistical constraint may influence how and when it is . CC-BY 4.0    "
66462,"There was no case of COVID-19 in Nigeria until February of 2020. Since then, COVID-19 cases have been reported daily by the NCDC and on an uptrend. Following the current global strategies aimed at limiting the spread of the Coronavirus, most countries, including Nigeria, have restricted movements and asked people to maintain social distancing and globally about 3 billion persons are currently being confined in one way or another. Due to high illiteracy and poverty rate in most developing countries, there is need to understand the trend of the spread of COVID-19 and extrapolate the implications of the strategies employed by the government in curbing the spread of the disease. Time-series analysis is a method to extrapolate predictions, in which a mathematical model is established according to the regularity and trend of the observed historical values with time (L. Liu, Luan, Yin, Zhu, & Lü, 2016; Q. Liu, Liu, Jiang, & Yang, 2011) AND has been widely used in predicting the spread of infectious diseases in recent years. For instance, some scholars have used this model to predict the spread of TB, mumps, measles, encephalitis B, and hand-foot-and-mouth disease (Allard, 1998; Jiabing, 2007; JIN et al., 2008; Musa, 2015; Wu et al., 2008; Yue et al., 2015) . These diseases are similar to COVID-19 in time distribution (Organization, 2020; Peiris et al., 2003; Sahin, 2020) . In this study, applying time series models as described above, to study the trend of the Covid-19 pandemic in Nigeria. Candidate models were obtained using the autocorrelation function (ACF) and the partial autocorrelation function (PACF), models were formulated based on the spikes observed from the ACF and PACF chart (Figure 2 ). ARIMA (1,1,0) was confirmed to be the optimal model based on the lowest AICc value. This model was then applied to study the trend of COVID-19 from April 26, 2020 to May 5, 2020. The incidence of COVID-19 from April 26 to May 5, 2020, shows an increasing growth steep in Nigeria (115.62771, 95% confidence limit of 87.18268-159.1306), which peak cannot be said to have been seen or reached yet. According to these results, we must be alert of the possibilities of COVID-19 spreading more than its currently observed as seen from the models' prediction. The proposed ease of lockdown restrictions by the federal government is expected to commence on May 4, 2020, and there is no indication of the trend to expect following the ease on restrictions. Countries like Germany have experienced an increased number in Covid19 positive cases after easing the country's restrictions. Based on our study's result, the trend of the spread of COVID-19 in Nigeria is expected to move in a upward trend. Having established a suitable model, Nigeria can apply this model to predict the trend of COVID-19 in the country. . CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0    ()  .  Government through the constituted presidential task force should be conscious of the wider spread if nothing is done as an addition to current lockdown for it is evident that the lockdown is not reducing the COVID-19 spread as expected.

66491,"In this paper, using an epidemic model coupled with statistical regression models we quantitatively explored the time series of infection spread in different countries for the COVID19 outbreak and its relation with quarantine measures as well as medical infrastructure. The reproduction numbers of this pandemic are found to be comparable to the SARS-cov values [22, 23] and much higher than the MERS infection [24, 25] . We employed the mathematical model and fitted the confirmed, recovered and dead population trajectories from 23 countries where the countries are a combination of early, mid and late stage infections for the first wave of COVID19 infection. The fitted mathematical models display large variabilities in the infection rate among countries as well as the reduction in their infection rates over time, primarily, due to implementation of the social distancing measures. We show that the variabilities can be correlated to some extent by disparate healthcare infrastructure. In the European countries, the infection has spread faster either due to strong airline connection with Wuhan or due to the cold climate but they could control the reproduction number( ) with R 0 time and the first wave of infection is almost over for many such countries (Figure 4 ). The lockdown measure to implement social distancing which is implemented in almost every country infected with COVID19, is a necessary measure to reduce the infection spread, but how well a country is sampling its population for testing and further how well they quarantine the infected population are also important factors during the lockdown. Lockdown is a preparatory measure for the health care system to reorganize itself to deal with the situation since long term lock down would be detrimental to the economy of any country [26] . .

66494,"The COVID-19 pandemic and lockdown has affected every facet of day-to-day life. Our preliminary analysis of data from the New Mum Study, including participants from most parts of the UK, indicates that for women and their infants, this 'new reality' affects their experiences during delivery and after birth. "
66499,"We have presented a mathematically simple framework for the study of the effects of public interventions in specific countries, regions or cities based on a SIQR model. Remarkably, we show that for all analyzed countries our model can effectively estimate the date in which the measures started being effective, thus allowing to assess the efficacy of the interventions put in place by the different governments and the response of the populations. Interestingly the regions that have lowered the growth rate to zero have imposed relatively mild restrictions. In New South Wales schools are not closed, but parents were invited to keep their children at home on March 23, 2020. This date coincides almost perfectly with our estimated date-of-change, suggesting that this invitation has been followed, and has had immediate effect. Indirect effects likely contribute: keeping children at home often means that their parent will work from home, and in addition, the increased awareness of the situation following such an invitation may have wider, general effects, as might be expected to have occurred in N.S.W. Similarly, B.C. has not imposed lockdown, although schools were closed on March 18, 2020 (in agreement with our estimated date-of-change) and restaurants are only allowed to sell take-away food. Switzerland, in spite of its closeness to Italy, has managed to contain COVID-19 without a strict lockdown as seen in Italy. In Switzerland, schools closed on March 16, 2020, and a partial lockdown involving closure of bars, shops and other gathering places, but leaving open certain essentials, such as grocery stores, pharmacies, (a reduced) public transport and the postal service, was imposed from March 17, 2020. We estimate that these interventions had effect on the COVID-19 transmission rate within a few days. Our analysis of Germany and Austria in many aspects mimic Switzerland, except that for Germany the growth rate is still positive (R 0 > 1). Our estimated date-of-change coincides with the dates of school closures and partial lockdown. Most German federal states closed schools from March 16, 2020 followed by the remaining country from March 18, 2020 -one day before our estimated date of change. The German government imposed partial lockdown from March 17, closing all non-essential shops, and imposing limitation restaurants and banning leisure activities, which was followed by further restrictions in the following days. On March 16 the government of Austria prohibited gatherings of groups of more than five people in public, and all schools were closed from March 17. On this latter date, the closure of restaurants was also ordered. People were recommended to leave home only for purchasing necessary goods (medications, groceries), for assisting other people, or 5 . CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0    "
66517,"This study explores the role of NPIs in reducing the spread of COVID-19. We extend the spatiotemporal SEIR model in (9) by incorporating daily social distancing numbers from transportation data and mobility patterns. Our model finds that without NPIs in place, COVID-19 cases would likely have shown a 37.8-fold increase across Germany. We also investigate the marginal impact of each of the various NPIs implemented by state governments in Germany by determining the differential impacts of the policies on reducing social mobility. We relate these reductions to disease spread, reconstructing patterns of spread across the 16 states. Finally, we forecast new cases when policies are relaxed, one-at-a-time. We find that certain policies have a larger impact on disease spread than others. Our model forecasts find that early relaxation of some NPIs could lead to an increase in the number of cases, potentially leading to a second wave. This observation is confirmed by an estimated increase in the effective reproduction number ' (Supplementary Material). We also compare case counts if the policies were relaxed with a oneweek delay. Keeping some NPIs in place for an extra week could reduce total COVID-19 cases by up to 19% (as of June 2, 2020). The results confirm that policy restrictions are not all equal in their ability to affect disease spread. The policy of restricting mass gatherings (Contact Restriction) is estimated to be the most effective NPI to contain COVID-19, followed by closures of various businesses and stay-at-home orders. Due to this variation in effect, it is advisable to lift restrictions with minimal effects first, gradually easing restrictions that potentially lead to higher case numbers. This study presents a comprehensive quantitative analysis that includes individual effects of NPIs on the transmission of COVID-19. To the best of . CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0    ()  .   our knowledge, this is the first study that uses variations in policy interventions by governments to discover their differential impacts at reducing mobility that in turn reduces disease spread. Prolonged lockdowns and restrictive policies can have devastating social and economic consequences. However, opening too soon could result in rapid disease spread. Therefore, governments need to develop cautious approaches to lifting restrictions in a bid to return to normalcy (23). The approach presented in this paper allows for a deeper understanding of the policy effects on mitigating the spread of COVID-19. The forecasts of disease spread when NPIs are (partially) loosened guide policymakers towards the appropriate strategy when reversing the interventions. "
66525,"The results show a generally strong correlation between strengthening of the quarantine controls, i.e. increasing Q(t) as learnt by the neural network model; actions taken by the regions' respective governments; and decrease of the effective reproduction number R t . For example, in Italy, government restrictions reportedly (Ghiglione et al. 2020) tightened during the week preceding mid March, which is also when our model shows a sharp increase in Q(t) and corresponding decrease in R t (figures 4b, c). For Wuhan and South Korea, similar cusps in government interventions took place earlier, in the weeks leading to and after the end of January (Cyranoski 2020) and February, respectively (Normille 2020) . These cusps were also captured well by our model (Figures 2b, c and  6b , c, respectively). Even for the USA, Q(t) shows a stagnation till 20 March 2020, after which it shows a sharp increase accompanied with a decrease in R t (Figures 8b, c) , which is in alignment with the ramping up of government policies and quarantine interventions post mid March in the worst affected states like New York, New Jersey, California, and Michigan. is the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the (which was not peer-reviewed)    A comparative analysis of the quarantine strength function Q(t) learned by the neural network for different countries reveals that Wuhan had the highest magnitude and South Korea had the highest growth rate of Q(t). This can be attributed to the stringent government interventions and strict public health measures including immediate isolation and quarantine impositions in Wuhan and South Korea. This eventually resulted in the halting of infection spread and a corresponding R t < 1 within a month for Wuhan ( Figure  2c ) and within 20 days for South Korea (figure 6c) after the first signs of a pandemic were recognized. It is reported that the infected case count stagnated nation-wide in China by the beginning of March (Cyranoski 2020 ) and in South Korea by the end of March (Fisher & Sang-Hun 2020) ; which eventually led to a stagnation in the quarantine interventions employed in these countries. This is in general qualitative agreement with our forecasting results which show a plateau in Q(t) and R t at R t < 1: Figures 3a,b and 7a ,b. In Italy, as of March 20 th , I(t) is appearing to be linear (Figure 4a) , which is consistent with lower rates of infections being actually reported (Horowitz & Kirkpatrick 2020) and can be taken as a precursor to stagnation. It is also consistent with adoption of strict movement restrictions by the government shortly before the March 20 th date. We forecast that, for Italy, R t will drop below 1 and Q(t), R t both will stagnate between mid to end of April 2020 (Figure 5a , b) indicating halting of the spread of infection. Owing to the relaxed quarantine and isolation policies in the US in its initial stages post the infection spread, our model converges to Q(t) ≈ 0.4 − 0.6 ( Figure 8b ) which is the smallest compared to other regions. Even though the effective R t is still greater than 1 as of April 1 2020 (Figure 8c ), its growth has started to show a decreasing trend and we expect the infection to start showing stagnation with R t < 1 by 20 April 2020 if the current US policies continue without change (Figures 9b, 10a ). This will be accompanied by a continuous ramp up of quarantine policies (Figure 9a ). At its peak, we forecast the infected count to reach approximately 600,000 before stagnation, again assuming no change in US policies. Our mixed model analysis for USA, employing Q(t) learnt from the models of Wuhan, Italy and South Korea in the USA model starting from 1 April 2020, reveals that stronger quarantine policies (Figure 10b ) might lead to an accelerated plateauing in the infected case count, as shown in Figure 10a , and subsequently smaller infected case count. On the other hand, in agreement with National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases estimates (Miller 2020) , we forecast that relaxing or abandoning the quarantine policies gradually over the period of the next 17 days may well lead to ∼ 1 million infections without any stagnation in the infected case count (Figure 10a ) by mid April 2020.

66530,"Background: With new cases of COVID-19 surging around the world, many countries have to prepare for moving beyond the containment phase. Prediction of the effectiveness of non-case-based interventions for mitigating, delaying or preventing the epidemic is urgent, especially for countries affected by the ongoing seasonal influenza activity. Methods: We developed a transmission model to evaluate the impact of self-imposed prevention measures (handwashing, mask-wearing, and social distancing) due to the spread of COVID-19 awareness and of short-term government-imposed social distancing on the peak number of diagnoses, attack rate and time until the peak number of diagnoses. Findings: For fast awareness spread in the population, self-imposed measures can significantly reduce the attack rate, diminish and postpone the peak number of diagnoses. A large epidemic can be prevented if the efficacy of these measures exceeds 50%. For slow awareness spread, self-imposed measures reduce the peak number of diagnoses and attack rate but do not affect the timing of the peak. Early implementation of short-term government interventions can only delay the peak (by at most 7 months for a 3-month intervention). Interpretation: Handwashing, mask-wearing and social distancing as a reaction to information dissemination about COVID-19 can be effective strategies to mitigate and delay the epidemic. We stress the importance of rapidly spreading awareness on the use of these self-imposed prevention measures in the population. Early-initiated short-term government-imposed social distancing can buy time for healthcare systems to prepare for an increasing COVID-19 burden.

66600,"These results indicate that public health measures undertaken in China reduced the of COVID-19 to (t ) R below the self-sustaining level of 1 within China by the middle of February. They also suggest, however, the limitations of isolation, quarantine, and large-scale attempts to limit travel. While the world-wide briefly dropped below 1 as China implemented extensive public health measures, the introduction (t ) R of the virus to other nations swiftly led to an increasing world-wide average value of . In Italy, the (t ) R nation hardest-hit following China, social distancing measures brought the local value of down. "
66621,"The current outbreak of novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) poses an unprecedented global health and economic threat to interconnected human societies. Until a vaccine is developed, strategies for controlling the outbreak rely on aggressive social distancing. These measures largely disconnect the social network fabric of human societies, especially in urban areas. Here, we estimate the growth rates and reproductive numbers of COVID-19 in US cities from March 14th through March 19th to reveal a power-law scaling relationship to city population size. This means that COVID-19 is spreading faster on average in larger cities with the additional implication that, in an uncontrolled outbreak, larger fractions of the population are expected to become infected in more populous urban areas. We discuss the implications of these observations for controlling the COVID-19 outbreak, emphasizing the need to implement more aggressive distancing policies in larger cities while also preserving socioeconomic activity."
66631,"We have presented a policy optimization model that can be used to dynamically determine the optimal intervention strategy to control the spread of the COVID-19 epidemic over time. In addition to lockdown measures, the model can also decide to use testing and tracing. We have further given an analysis that shows testing and tracing in a combined strategy can be many times more cost effective at reducing the R number than lockdown measures alone. . CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0    ()  .   When running the model with parameters originating from a least squares fit to the available data for Scotland, we find that testing and tracing results in strategies with a lower death toll and lower costs than without tracing. For high values of tracing effectiveness and fraction of infectious people traced the differences compared to an intervention strategy without tracing are striking. In the cases where the theoretical analysis suggests that tracing alone would be able to contain (or nearly contain) the spread of the virus, the policy optimization confirms that no (or little) additional lockdown measures are needed. However, even for low tracing effectiveness, the model shows a marked reduction in lockdown measures and associated economic costs compared to a model without tracing. This is in contradiction to the popular claim that tracing would need to find at least 60% of infectious people in order to be worthwhile. We should note that there are many assumptions and simplifications in our model and despite our best efforts the data that we used and inferred through the fitting process has large error bars associated with it. The model therefore cannot be used to make any quantitative predictions about the future evolution of the disease or about the optimal intervention strategy. We also want to point out that the model is able to make optimal decisions, and consequently at early times in the intervention cycle will assume that optimal decisions are made later, (e.g. with regard to severity and timing of any future lockdown interventions). This will result in the predictions from the model to be overly optimistic. Also the model is deterministic in that it assumes full knowledge of the disease parameters (in particular the proportion of the population already exposed to the disease), something that is not known (or will only be known at a later point in time) in practice. We have, however, done various robustness tests of our results with changed parameters and are confident of the main qualitative result: mainly that effective tracing is a crucial part of any successful intervention strategy to control the epidemic will hold true in the real life setting. An obvious extension to our study would look at how robust the results are with respect to uncertainty regarding disease parameters, and inexactness of implementing the planned policies in the future.

66660,"Daily new cases dataset since January 2020 were used to search for evidences of SARS-CoV-2 community transmission as the main nowadays cause of constant infection rates among countries. Despite traditional forms of transmission of this virus (droplets and aerosols in medical facilities), new evidence suggests aerosols forming patterns in the atmosphere as a main factor of community transmission outside medical spaces. Following these findings, this research focused on comparing some countries and the adopted policy used as preventive framework for virus community transmission. Countries social distancing policy aspect, of one to two meters of physical distance, was statistically analyzed from January to early May 2020, and countries were divided into those implementing only social physical distance and those implementing distancing with additional transmission isolation (with masks and city disinfection). Correlating countries social distancing policy adoption with other preventive measures such as social isolation and COVID-19 testing, a new indicator results, derived from SIR models and Weibull parameterization, show that only social physical distance measure could act as a factor for SARS-CoV-2 transmission with respect to atmosphere carrier potential. In this sense, the type of social distancing framework adopted by some countries without additional measures might represent a main model for the constant reproductive spread patterns of SARS-CoV-2 within the community transmission. Finally, the findings have important implications for the policy making to be adopted globally as well as individual-scale preventive methods."
66673,"Despite the limitations, we reported through SARI electronic notification systems as a proxy for severe cases of COVID19 an important decrease on the R(t) after two week of the implementation of social distance measures in the SPMA.

66694,"The goal of this study was to quantify the effects of social distancing measures implemented by city and state governments on COVID-19 infection rates. Current commentaries on whether social distancing measures have worked have largely relied on visual representations of epidemic curves looking more or less steep (slope). However, it is crucial to gather statistical support for these observations so that solid conclusions can be made to help guide public health measures. We found that taking longer to close schools was positively associated with cumulative incidence at the state level. The effects of social distancing measures appeared different in cities with a higher population density when compared to those with a lower population density. Some of the findings in this study were counterintuitive, including inverse associations between cumulative incidence and days to closure of non-essential business and restrictions on gatherings. However, it seems doubtful that these measures are actually protective. This finding is more likely due to reverse causality, with locations that initially had slower growth rates initially chose not to implement measures until they absolutely needed to respond to an increased epidemic growth. Analysis is also complicated by the fact that both ""non-essential business"" and ""gatherings"" were defined very differently between locations, making a true comparison difficult. Additionally, we only used the date of the first restriction to gathering of any sort, due to the complexity of creating standard variables that can encompass the numerous variations of restrictions while still gaining meaningful statistical results. For certain social distancing measures, such as school closure, lack of consistent results showing a protective effect on early closings should be interpreted with caution, as the small sample size for number of cities and states make it difficult to achieve statistically significant results. It also   ()   .   cannot be ruled out that closing of schools may not have occurred soon enough in highly populated cities to have a significant effect. Additionally, since all locations ultimately closed schools, the effect of not closing schools at all is unknown. Our results highlight that states and cities may have different social distancing factors associated with cumulative incidence, and these factors may also be driven by additional factors such as higher population density. This suggests that not only do states and cities need individual approaches to containment of an epidemic, each location must be aware of their own structure in terms of crowding and socio-economic variables. Given the exorbitantly high rates of COVID-19 in some cities, cities cannot afford to wait for state mandates to implement social distancing measures. The study by Courtemanche et al. may be the most similar published study to our analysis, which found no evidence that school closures or bans on large social gatherings affected growth rate. They found that closing restaurant dining rooms/bars and/or entertainment centers/gyms led to significant reductions in the growth rates. There were several aspects of their study that differed from our study, including analysis at the county level, an outcome of daily growth rate, and use of a combined variable for restaurant closure with other types of business closures. Additionally, they did not adjust for epidemics beginning at different time points in different locations or socio-demographic variables (13) . The model they used is not one of comparisons between groups, however it must be recognized that the U.S. does have several sub-populations that vary in these variables. It is important to consider that measures are needed to protect children in addition to adults. Recent data suggests that children may be susceptible to rare but severe manifestations of COVID-19 infection. As of May 5, 2020, there had been 64 suspected cases of what is being termed ""Pediatric Multi-System Inflammatory Syndrome Temporally Associated with COVID-19"" in New York state, with similar magnitude observed in Europe (23). There have been 4 confirmed deaths as of May 11, 2020 (24) . The disease appears rare and requires further investigation, but such severe manifestations of COVID-19 in children warrants careful deliberation of the opening and closing schools. There must also be an acknowledgement that several other variables affect cumulative incidence, including percent of Black/African American individuals in a city, percent in poverty and socioeconomic variables such as percent who own a computer, and percent who have internet access at home. Additionally, several medical conditions were associated with cumulative incidence. However, other variables that logically might be associated with cumulative incidence did not show a significant effect, including percent Hispanic, percent with hypertension, percent with heart failure and use of carpooling or public transit for work. Many COVID-19 analyses, including the present study, suggest a disproportionate burden of illness and death among racial and ethnic minority groups, particularly the Black/African American community (25) . Differences in health outcomes between racial and ethnic groups are often due to poor social determinants of health (i.e., living in densely populated and often multigenerational homes, working in essential industries often without proper insurance or sick leave, and facing institutional racism, discrimination, and stigma which undermine prevention efforts).   ()  It is well documented that Black/African Americans have a higher risk for hypertension, type 2 diabetes, obesity, and cardiovascular diseases, which are the most common comorbidities seen in the current outbreak. These were also the most common comorbidities in previous coronavirus outbreaks such as SARS and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV) (26, 27, 28) . It was surprising that the percent of Hispanics in a location did not show a significant association with cumulative incidence in our study, as data sources show that Hispanics (of any race) have a poverty level higher than Whites (17.5% vs 10.1%) (20, 29) . Theoretically, the percent of Hispanics in a location would be associated with higher cumulative incidence as well. This finding needs to be explored in more detail. While our study had many strengths, there were weaknesses as well. The biggest issue is the use of aggregate data from a variety of external sources. Each source has its own strength and limitations. Ideally, socio-economic variables should be evaluated by using individual level data. In terms of social distancing laws, it is unclear how each state and/or city reported their data, which may lead to a great deal of heterogeneity. Similarly, the definitions for social distancing measures were vastly different between locations. We did not distinguish between these details, and they are likely important. Another potential limitation was our use of binary variables using median values as cutoffs for analysis. There are several ways data can be analyzed, and it is possible that there is a superior approach to analyzing social distancing variables. Despite the limitations in categorizing the data, we opted for this method because of sample size limitations which could affect statistical power. We initially conducted analyses evaluating each variable as a continuous variable but opted not to report on these results due to the complexities of reporting the effects of a change in 1 unit of a variable on a 1 point change in cumulative incidence, as is obtained from using continuous predictor variables in regression. We opted to pursue an approach that could be meaningfully understood and used by city and state governments, both in numerical and visual format. Future studies should investigate the effects of social distancing measures in all cities, which would substantially increase sample size. Certain variables, such as use of public transit vary substantially between cities. Additionally, data can also be analyzed by new cases per day, number of hospitalizations or mortality rates, as these may show different patterns than our analysis. Despite the weaknesses in our study, the strengths of our study are the distinction between the effects of social distancing between states and cities, as well as statistical adjustment for multiple confounding variables. Currently, it is unclear whether there will be a second wave of COVID-19 epidemics throughout the country. Limited data on wearing masks and behaviors towards gatherings suggest that failure to follow these measures may be the most challenging aspect of infection control in the U.S. A cross-sectional survey of 1034 US residents showed that 30% of people reported attending gatherings with more than 50 people and 76% of people did not wear masks outside the home (30) . In contrast, a Chinese research study reported that only 3.6% of people reported going to crowded places and 2.0% reported not wearing masks outside the home (31). Ultimately, the success of government mandates will be affected by human behavior.   ()   .   In conclusion, our findings demonstrate the need for a tailored, evidence-based public health response to curbing the COVID-19 pandemic. Given the immense toll the pandemic has taken on human lives in nearly every location in the U.S., all locations must take basic infection control precautions as well as social distancing measures. Areas of high risk must implement localized measures that go beyond broader state measures. While the scientific community acknowledges that there is not a single data source that will guide the pandemic response, this study demonstrates that relying solely on health services data (i.e., number of hospitalizations, tests completed, deaths, etc.) has its limitations. Government officials should be conducting robust evaluations of community mitigation strategies such as physical distancing at the state and local levels. Including an evaluation of these measures to guide reopening efforts will give officials a more holistic sense of community health and wellbeing. Efforts should be guided by a ""health in all policies' framework, which is designed to facilitate collaboration between public health practitioners and nontraditional partners (e.g. school or transportation officials) (32) . The pandemic response workforce should be trained in cultural humility, health literacy, community engagement and outreach, addressing implicit bias, and ensuring all protocols and quality improvement initiatives are systematically implemented and evaluated. Finally, a failure to follow recommended infection control strategies will likely result in a similar result with a second pandemic wave regardless of a second round of government implemented social distancing measures.

66703,"Mobility control measures are of crucial importance for public health planning in the outbreak of the In this study, we explore the relationships between mobility and epidemic spread and If the whole Hubei province was not quarantined after the Wuhan lockdown, further national seeding and subsequent infections might become inevitable. By Mar 12, 2020, Hubei excluding Wuhan has more confirmed cases (17, 795) than China excluding Hubei (13, 032) . 24 Our results suggest that, in cities outside Hubei, the travel restriction of Hubei (excluding Wuhan) is more effective than other inter-city .

On Jan 26, all airports and railway stations in Hubei were closed. 25 Before Jan 30, all other provinces in mainland China suspended their inter-provincial road transport to and from Hubei (Table S1) For cities without reported infections before the Wuhan lockdown, the preventive prohibition of both inter-city and intra-city population movement is essential to their epidemic control. The prohibition of inter-city population movement from cities outside the Hubei and intra-city population movement prevented 405 more confirmed cases (95%PI: 342-468) in Stage One (Table S3) , occupying 69.9% of the number of preventions by all local travel bans. The travel controls in cities without initial confirmed cases tend to be relatively late or loose than those in cities having initial infections. From Jan 24 to Jan 30, 2020, the inter-city population movement from cities outside Hubei and intra-city population movement in cities without initial confirmed cases decreased on average to 64.4% and 72.6% of those in the same period of 2019, while the percentage are averagely 59.2% and 65.2% for cities with initial confirmed cases ( Table   . CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0   author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity. is the (which was not peer-reviewed)    S2). The local travel restrictions were necessary and practical to cities without initial confirmed cases, even if they were not that strict. Different mobility patterns influenced the COVID-19 spread in different periods. Our results show, in the early stage of epidemic development, it is the inter-city mobility, including from Wuhan, from Hubei excluding Wuhan, and from other cities outside Hubei, that promotes the spatial spread of the virus. After the quarantine of the whole Hubei and the prohibition of inter-city transport, the importance of restricting the intra-city population movement is highlighted. If there were no restrictions on intra-city population movement, the confirmed cases in cities outside Hubei might increase 33.1% (95%PI: 19.3%-46.9%) in the third and fourth weeks after the Wuhan lockdown. The intra-city travel restrictions played vital roles in the epidemic control in China. It is worth noting that China has implemented many non-pharmacological interventions, not limited to these travel restrictions. Source control measures, like isolating people with the virus, monitoring or quarantining symptoms of healthy contacts, requiring masks for individuals in all public places, etc., have been introduced to reduce potential secondary infections. 26, 27 It is the intensive source control that reduces new local infections. The contribution of population movement from Wuhan or Hubei to subsequent epidemic development might also be dampened due to the implementation of source control measures. 7 Without the implementation of combined source control measures, our study, at least in the model of Stage Two, might have different results. Our study quantified the relationships between mobility patterns and epidemic trajectory in China and highlighted the importance of synchronized travel restrictions across cities. Several policy implications . CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0   author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity. is the (which was not peer-reviewed)    can be drawn. First, the geographical extension of the quarantine should be carefully considered by the government before the official announcement. In the early stage of epidemic development, there might be a nonnegligible number of infected but undetected people in the areas that have geographical connections and frequent traffic with the epidemic-stricken ones, like other cities in Hubei. In particular, there are many asymptomatic virus careers that are highly contagious. 23, 28 On the other hand, the expansion of the quarantined area would also bring substantial economic losses. Whether to include farther hinterlands, and if so to what extent, will need to be carefully considered carefully in making the quarantine decision. Second, our results show the importance of timely and active local countermeasures by cities outside of the epicenter. While actual travel control measures may differ across cities, simply by compressing the time gap between Wuhan and other cities could further reduce the COVID-19 outbreak. It is important for countries and governments to impose timely interventions to combat the pandemic. "
66751,"Many studies focused on the estimation of the basic reproductive number R 0 of the COVID-19 epidemic, based on data-driven methods and mathematical models (e.g., [21, 4] ) describing the epidemic from its beginning. In average, the estimated value of R 0 was about 3.3. We focused here on an observation period that began after the lockdown was set in France. We obtained an effective reproduction number that was divided by a factor 7, compared to the estimate of the R 0 carried out in France at the early stage of the epidemic, before the country went into lockdown (a value R 0 = 3.2 was obtained in [12] ). This indicates that the restriction policies 7 . CC-BY-ND 4.0    "
66775,"The purpose of this study was to assess the regional and national impacts of the French lockdown on epidemiological outcomes, namely hospital requirements and mortality, using a deterministic, compartmental model. Indeed, one month after its beginning, to our knowledge, no figures are available on the averted burden of the COVID-19 in France. From March 19 to April 19, we estimated that the lockdown might have averted around 590,000 hospitalizations and 140,000 ICU admissions over all metropolitan France, corresponding to relative reductions of 88% and 91%, respectively. We estimated that, over this period, more than 100,000 ICU beds might have been occupied at the same time at the national level. Regarding the mortality burden of the COVID-19, the French lockdown might have averted slightly more than 61,000 deaths in hospitals. These results varied slightly between regions, but the lockdown seems to have had an important impact in all regions. Indeed, the regional relative reductions ranged from 70% to 98% for the different considered hospital requirements and deaths. Related to theses regional disparities, we noted that the estimated reproduction numbers were surprisingly high in some regions, especially in Pays de la Loire and Nouvelle-Aquitaine with values greater than 4. However, these values may not reflect a high number of cases in these regions, but may be likely related to a more recent introduction of COVID-19 in the region (smaller initial lag were estimated for these regions compared to the other regions). This may also be due to population movements before the start of the lockdown to these two specific regions located on the West coast of France, which could contribute to bias our estimates. However, this assumption should be confirmed with geolocalisation of mobile phones for example, as data currently at our disposal do not allow us to answer this question. Taking into account the latest information on the SARS-CoV-2 and its characteristics, namely regarding its transmission and its infectivity, the model used here is an enhanced version of our previous model developed to forecast hospital needs at the start of the epidemic in France. 5 The present model is composed of 8 compartments, whom 5 are dedicated to the infected phase, compared to 1 in a classic SEIR model. In more details, based on the knowledge on the transmission of the virus, we included two 11 . CC-BY-NC 4.0    With a month's hindsight, our study shows that the national lockdown, started in France on March 17, 2020, had an important impact on the evolution of the COVID-19 epidemic. This unprecedented measure drastically reduced the number of hospital and ICU admissions, and prevented a large number of deaths at the national level. Without this lockdown, the COVID-19 epidemic would have had a critical morbidity and mortality burden in France, overwhelming the French healthcare system in a matter of weeks. Without any efficient treatment or vaccine, our results reinforce the need to control the COVID-19 pandemic by measures at least as efficient as a nation-wide lockdown. "
66865,"The world is going through a pandemic, and almost every country is affected by it. A country as well as the States needs to know how much burden of active and confirmed cases it will have to bear in the coming time. It will help the states in taking pre-active measures to prepare adequate health infrastructure for the coming time based on future needs. We used ARIMA model and Auto ARIMA model on the time series data of COVID-19 cases in West Bengal for forecasting the total confirmed and active cases till August end. Based on the forecasts, confirmed cases for West Bengal at the end of June are expected to be 17838-18724 (95% CI: 128806, 227968). West Bengal will be having 27147-30616 confirmed cases (95% CI: 173917, 415800) in the mid of July from the estimates, Even West Bengal will be having 50588-55617 confirmed cases (95% CI: 198917, 525800) in the mid of August from the estimates & we expect that India will be having Estimated Cases -62279 ± 5000 at the end of August. These results also show that daily confirmed cases are increasing at a faster pace even at the end of June with around 400-500 daily confirmed cases, so it is likely that peak will be attained afterwards. According to our forecasts, it is a very alarming situation for India & West Bengal in coming days. However, the actual numbers can go higher than our estimates of confirmed cases, active cases & trends we made based on the data till June 3rd in this forecast, when West Bengal observed complete lockdown. Currently, West Bengal has a partial lockdown or Following Unlock 1.0 with restrictions varying for three zones (red, orange and green zone) based on the current assessment of the situation in there. Lockdown is getting lifted, and in this case, there will be a surge in the number of daily confirmed and active cases. The requirement of isolation beds, ICUs and ventilators will also be increased in that scenario. The migrants are returning to their homes due to loss of livelihood and income in the lockdown period, which may lead to a rise in the number of cases, and could not be accounted for, in our projections. So, India and its majorly affected states like Maharashtra, Gujarat, Tamil Nadu and Delhi & West Bengal need to be well prepared for the pandemic challenge in coming time and focus on increasing their healthcare infrastructure, and other states should also remain alert till the pandemic completely recedes. We suggest a Public-Private Partnership (PPP) model in the health sector to accommodate COVID-19 patients adequately and reduce the burden of the already overstretched Indian public health care system. "
66901,"Aiming at a balance of infections, deaths and economic loss, we simulated and evaluated how and when to take which intensity level of interventions was a feasible way to control the COVID-19 outbreak in the Europe. We found rolling intervention between suppression and mitigation with high intensity could be an effective and efficient choice to limit the total deaths but maintain essential mobility for avoiding huge economic lose and society anxiety in a long period. Rolling intervention was more effective in smaller cities. Due to lower population density and less human mobility, realising some intervention intensity would not lead to a second breakout of COVID-19 and benefit maintenance of business activities. Considering difference and diversity of industrial structure of the regions with large population density and small population density in Europe, hybrid intervention was more suitable and effective to control outbreaks. For example, such strategy could complete London outbreak with suppression in 3 months and tolerate a longer recovery period of non-London regions taking 3 weeks rolling intervention. The rapid completion of outbreak in the city like London would strongly benefit to economic recovery. Other regions maintained essential production and business activities to offer sufficient support. In above scenarios, our model found that the total infections in the UK was limited to 9.3 million; the total deaths in the UK was limited to 143 thousand. Also, the peak time of healthcare demand would occur at the 70 th day (16 th April 2020), where it needed sufficient hospital beds to accommodate 61.3 thousand severe and critical cases. This scenario echoed that applying suppression at a right time was crucial to delay the peak date of healthcare needs and increase available hospital beds for severe and critical cases. We found that while immediate suppression being taken in Wuhan at 14 days earlier than London reduced 4.7 times infections, it led to nearly 2.34 times of severe and critical cases at non-hospital places (Wuhan: Peak 2789 at the 43 th day, London, Peak 1191 at the 57 th day). It implied that taking immediate suppression without sufficient hospital beds was risky and led to more deaths in the early breakout. Our finding revealed that implementing suppression intervention required considering other conditions of this region like culture difference, industrial structure, etc. Success of immediate suppression in Wuhan relied on strict lockdown of human mobility to community level and sufficient resource support from other cities or provinces in China. If there were no sufficiently external support, it would be risky to take highly intensive suppression to entire country due to shortage of healthcare resources and huge impacts on its economics. In Europe, it was hardly to practically implement the same level of intensity as Wuhan. If intensive suppression was relaxed at any time points, the transmission would quickly rebound. This was more like a multi-modal curve when taking multi-intervention strategies in Fig.1 . Therefore, we concluded that taking rolling intervention was more suitable to Europe. Specifically, this control measure could be named as ""Besieged and rolling interventions"", that implements hybrid interventions with diverse intensities and different periods of maintenance in region-levels of a country, which .

66939,"This analysis does support the assertion that a bad test is worse than no tests, but a good test is only effective in a carefully designed strategy. More is not necessarily better and over estimation of the test accuracy could be extremely detrimental. This analysis is not a prediction; the numbers used in this analysis are estimates, and therefore, when such policies are devised and implemented this analysis would need to be repeated with more up-to-date numerical values. As such, the authors are not drawing firm conclusions about the absolute necessary capacity of tests. Nor do they wish to make specific statements about the necessary sensitivity or specificity of tests or the recommended rate of release from quarantine. The authors do, however, propose some conclusions that would broadly apply to the present situation, and therefore believe they should be considered by policy makers when designing strategies to tackle COVID-19.

67014,"The state got into the action by January and rolled out measures that reduced the spread of the Covid-19. The first coronavirus case in India was confirmed in Kerala's Trissur district on January 30, 2020. Ever since, the state has been fighting the pandemic in an exemplary manner. The steps were simple but proactive. The equation for Kerala's success has been simple, prioritized testing, widespread contact tracing, and promoting social distance. Besides that two factors fuelled this success, the 'formidable' grass root level primary health care system and the experience it gleaned in the last two years when it handled another deadly virus outbreak (2018 Nipah virus outbreak in Kerala). State announces its strategy is trace, quarantine, test, isolate and treat in the beginning only. The state soon began implementing mandatory quarantines for visitors arriving from abroad and from outside of the state, weeks before the Centre instituted similar measures across the country. They also imposed uncompromising controls, were supported by an excellent healthcare system, government accountability, transparency, public trust, civil rights and importantly the decentralized governance and strong grass-root level institutions. This much decentralized system has hold out the test of two severe floods and another viral outbreak in past years, ordinarily making good use of the active and voluntary engagement of the public. While the rest of India worries about the rate at which new cases are doubling, that question has become almost irrelevant in Kerala, the curve has been flattened for now and transmission limited. Currently, how it manages to ease the lockdown safely will depend on a large number of factors. The summer monsoon rains, the floods that will follow, as well as returning migrants will add layers of complexity. But one thing is clear: when the next wave of novel coronavirus hits, which it will, the state will be ready. The ""proactive"" measures taken by Kerala such as .

67045,"The trend of effective reproduction number (R t ) of COVID19 in India indicates that control measures have been effective in slowing down the spread of COVID19 across the country. To achieve sustained suppression, monitoring of the time varying R t at district, state and national level should be done to reach and maintain an R t close to the threshold value of 1. If lockdown is to be extended, additional benefits can be achieved if it is extended farther after the peak of active cases has passed. As these restrictions are relaxed, increased detection through testing will be essential in limiting the resurgence of cases and thus testing capacity should be ramped up . CC-BY-NC 4.0    "
67103,"COVID-19 cases are alarmingly increasing in Pakistan since May 2020. Laboratory based surveillance system has been in place since the start of the pandemic. The genomic surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 strains isolated locally has been conducted based on partial ORF1b. The sequences were classified to show the phylogenetic correlation and showed 100% homology with those detected in neighboring countries India and China. The rapid increase in cases has led to development of robust strategies to enhance the laboratory testing capacity. We are currently meeting the country requirement to diagnose the virus in the community. Nonetheless, factors like recent ease in lockdown measures has led to massive rise in number of cases in few weeks time."
67114,"In conclusion, in this article it was possible to determine the role of lockdown of susceptible population and isolation of infectious population, depending on the basic reproductive number, which is a key element in the spread of epidemics in general, and of Covid19 in particular. To deal with this problem we have subdivided the time period from 2 March to 5 April 2020 into three periods: 1-Beginning of the outbreak (March 2-8): Appearance of a few imported cases. We showed that, in the first period, the transmission rate was low, which explains the moderate growth in the cumulative number of infected population. In the second period, the transmission rate of the epidemic becomes higher, and the cumulative number of infected population increases. In the last phase and taking into account lockdown and isolation, the transmission rate becomes smaller compared to the second phase. Since the basic reproductive number depends on the lockdown and isolation rates, we have shown that if these rates are increased, the number becomes smaller than 1, and larger than 1 otherwise. In conclusion, controlling an outbreak means controlling the lockdown rate of the susceptible and isolation rate of infected, which is confirmed by figures 4, 5 and 6. "
67137,"The SIR and Logistic Growth models have been implemented based on the trends in COVID-19 cases obtained for all of India as well as the highly affected states of Maharashtra, Gujarat and Delhi until 13 May. MATLAB functions have been utilized in order to forecast future trends. A high goodness of fit (R 2 > 0.99, p < 0.0001) was obtained for all the cases and models studied. ()   (Figure 4 ) converges at 50,874 (95% CI, 50,453-51,295) cases on 5 July with the peak being attained on 15 May with 1,327 (95% CI, 1156-1498) cases. It is interesting to observe that the logistic model suggests a decline in the number of cases towards the end of the third stage of the lockdown, rendering it effective, whilst the SIR model depicts that cases will peak well after the lockdown is over, implying the need for further restrictive measures. Gujarat has recorded 8,903 cases as of 13 May, the second highest tally in India after Maharashtra. The highest hike in cases recorded in a span of 24 hours was reported to be 441 cases on 6 May. The SIR model ( Figure 5 ) suggests that cases in Gujarat will begin to decline after attaining a peak at 373 (95% CI, 313-433) cases on 11 May, which is in agreement with the actual data. The total number of cases is expected to reach 16,011 (95% CI, 15,561-16,461) by 30 July. On the other hand, the logistic model ( Figure 6 ) converges to 12,114 (95% CI, 11,540-12,688) cases with an endpoint of 23 June. The model also implies that epidemic has already peaked at 362 (95% CI, 314-410) cases on 5   ()  On an analysis of the results obtained, a number of deductions may be made from the trends yielded by both models. The most prominent observation deals with the region-specific nature of the propagation of the pandemic. The endpoints of the pandemic vary widely with region, with a cessation in cases being forecast for 30 July in Gujarat and 9 September in Delhi by the SIR model. The logistic model similarly forecasts wide variation in endpoints, from 23 June in Gujarat to 10 August in Delhi. A possible reason for this may be the restriction on inter-state travel implemented in India since 25 March 2020, which seem to have stemmed the propagation of the disease among states. Similar results were obtained by Calafiore et al. [33] , who predicted varying trends for the spread of COVID-19 in different Italian provinces. At the same time, the SIR model indicates evident similarities in the propagation of COVID-19 in all the regions studied. The contact rate β is observed to be similar (0.54-0.56) for all the three states studied (Table 1) . This indicates a partial success of social distancing measures, suggesting that the rate of transmission of disease is similar in all highly-affected regions irrespective of demographic indices such as population density. The value of average infectious period 1/γ is 6   ()   .   Figure 5 : Cumulative and daily cases forecast for Gujarat using the SIR model. Figure 6 : Cumulative and daily cases forecast for Gujarat using the Logistic Growth model. also observed to be minimally variant among the states studied, with a minimum of 2.04 for Delhi and a maximum of 2.22 for Maharashtra. The value of β for India is 0.42, indicating the diminishing impact of other, less-affected regions, while 1/γ is 2.94, which is similar to the median incubation period of 3 days observed in China [39] . The estimated value of R 0 for India as a whole is minimally variant from the R 0 values of individual Indian states which constitute 55% of the total cases nationwide (Table 1) , with a maximum variation of 6.6% for Delhi. These values are also in concordance with reported values [40] . The Logistic Growth model forecasts lower case numbers as well as early endpoints for all the regions studied. It is also observed to be significantly less sensitive to variations in recent case numbers as compared to the SIR model. Using the logistic model, significant variations in the infection rate parameter r may be observed among states. The lowest infection rate of 0.07 is estimated for Delhi while the highest is estimated for Gujarat (0.12). The forecast of the logistic model indicates that the impact of restrictive measures has varied widely over the country, and demographic factors have a role to play in determining the progression of disease in different states. Significant deductions may also be drawn from the forecasts obtained regarding the impact of restrictive measures such as the lockdown on the propagation of COVID-19 in India. In the states of Gujarat and Maharashtra as well as for India as a whole, the progressively-eased lockdown totaling 53 days seems to have had a prominent impact, with the SIR model forecasting a peak in cases being reached inside the lockdown period for Gujarat and within 15 days of Lockdown 3 for India and Maharashtra. The logistic model forecasts that a peak in cases will be reached by Maharashtra and Gujarat as well as India within the lockdown period. Both the models indicate that the impact of the lockdown in Delhi has been nominal, with a peak being reached 15 to 30 days after Lockdown 3 as per existing trends. Previous studies such as those by Sardar et al. [38] and Singh and Adhikari [41] forecast that a complete lockdown 7   ()  would lead to a sharp drop in cases during the initial 21-day period itself. That such a drop hasn't taken place yet indicates that stricter enforcement of social distancing guidelines is required throughout India. It is prudent to mention here that a significant majority of cases which the forecasts are based on, were detected during the lockdown period; an easing of the lockdown after 17 May is likely to lead to a spike in cases and a delay in the peak number of cases being reached. Especially for states such as Maharashtra and Delhi, where the peak is forecast to be reached after 17 May, it would be recommended that restrictions stay in place until a fall in cases is begun to be observed. As with any study involving mathematical modeling, the current work involves caveats and limitations. The primary elements of the study are the data, the mathematical models applied and the numerical code, the sources and explanations ()   .   for all of which have been included. However, future incidences such as the easing of social distancing measures may lead to a further increase in the number of cases than forecast. Additionally, factors that might increase the number of cases such as testing capacity have not been considered. While using the current forecast for a qualitative and quantitative understanding of the progress of COVID-19 in India, it would hence be prudent to consider these, as well as a number of other economics, social, demographic and medical factors. The present work calibrated the Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) model and the Logistic Growth model to forecast the spread of SARS-CoV-2 virus using the data available till 13 May 2020 in India and its highest impacted states, namely Delhi, Maharashtra and Gujarat. The following are the primary conclusions from the same. • The total number of cases forecasted using the SIR model were greater than those for the Logistic Growth model for all cases considered. The expected endpoints also show a similar trend, with the Logistic Growth model predicting an earlier endpoint in contrast with the SIR model for all regions. • The endpoint of COVID-19 in India using the SIR model is predicted to be 12 September 2020. The Logistic Growth model forecasts the endpoint to be 23 July 2020. • For the state of Maharashtra, the end point is expected to be 20 August 2020 as per the SIR model and 5 July 2020 as per the Logistic Growth model. • Cases in Delhi are expected to converge on 9 September 2020 according to the SIR model and on 10 August 2020 according to the Logistic Growth model. • The SIR model predicts an endpoint of 30 July 2020 for the state of Gujarat, while the Logistic Growth model forecasts the same to be 23 June 2020. • Modelling the spread of COVID-19 using two distinct mathematical models has allowed us to tune different parameters derived from actual data, and has provided broad insights over the present situation. • Our projections also take into account the various lockdowns and restrictive measures imposed by the Government of India. Analysing the data from various states has enabled us to identify changes in the trajectories of the spread of SARS-CoV-2 as a result of social distancing. • It is recommended that current restrictive measures stay in place with even improved implementation in order that an eventual rise in cases doesn't exceed the forecast values.

67164,"By May 29, 2020, all 50 states in the United States had reopened their economies to some extent after the coronavirus lockdown. There have been many policy debates about when a state should reopen its economy. On one hand, reopening the economy reduces unemployment. On the other hand, reopening the economy prematurely may increase the spread of the coronavirus. There have been few rigorous, quantitative studies of this topic. This study uses the synthetic control method to rigorously study the short-term effect of reopening the economy on the daily confirmed COVID-19 cases, daily deaths, and daily tests in 6 states (Alabama, Colorado, Georgia, Mississippi, Tennessee, and Texas) that reopened before May 1 st . I find that all these states experienced a sharp increase in both confirmed COVID-19 cases, and COVID-19 related deaths. Except for Georgia, the other 5 states saw a decline in the number of tests performed after they reopened the economy. The magnitude of the increase in confirmed cases and deaths is substantial. It resulted in an additional 2000 deaths in the 6 states compared with their control counterparts. It also increased daily confirmed cases by 40%, 52%, and 53% after the first, second, and third weeks of reopening, respectively. However, the increase 5 The average number of daily tests performed at week 0 is 5,684. . CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0    "
67165,"The reproduction number (R0) is broadly considered as a key indicator for the spreading of the COVID-19 pandemic. The estimation of its value with respect to the key threshold of 1.0 is a measure of the need, and eventually effectiveness, of interventions imposed in various countries. Here we present an online tool for the data driven inference and quantification of uncertainties for R0 as well as the time points of interventions for 51 European countries. The study relies on the Bayesian calibration of the simple and well established SIR model with data from reported daily infections. The model is able to fit the data for most countries without individual tuning of parameters. We deploy an open source Bayesian inference framework and efficient sampling algorithms to present a publicly available GUI () that allows the user to assess custom data and compare predictions for pairs of European countries. The results provide a ranking based on the rate of the disease's spread suggesting a metric for the effectiveness of social distancing measures. They also serve to demonstrate how geographic proximity and related times of interventions can lead to similarities in the progression of the epidemic."
67179,"This work has addressed the problem of monitoring and tracking the evolution of a viral epidemic, such as Covid-19, through the application of signal processing techniques to the time series of data reported by governments and health agencies. Three main contributions can be pointed out: 1) the exclusive use of time-varying geometric ratios of daily data to track the disease, rather than the customary virus reproductive number ( : ); 2) the development of a simple algebraic model relating the geometric ratio of infectious people, ( ), with those of positives, reported and dead; 3) the application of a nonlinear KF, along with a smoothing technique, to estimate the evolution of ( ). By properly fitting the estimated values of ( ) to a decreasing exponential, an accurate prediction of the epidemic peak can be made, as early as two weeks before the peak actually takes place. The proposed methodology has been satisfactorily tested on a simulated case, in the presence of Gaussian noise and other sources of uncertainty, the main one being the number of infectious people at the onset of the outbreak. It has also been applied to a pool of countries, six of which are reported in this paper, namely: China, South Korea, Italy, Spain, UK and the USA. The evolution of ( ) reflects in all cases the severity of the lockdown, allowing the peak of the epidemic to be forecasted well in advance. For UK and the USA, a noticeable change in the trend of ( ) can be observed over the last two weeks, suggesting that the peak may be further away than expected in April.  "
67185,"We find that unmitigated transmission of Covid-19 in a population of 30,000 staff, faculty and students would lead to hundreds of illnesses, many hospitalizations and likely some deaths in this population, which would be an unacceptable outcome by administrators and the university community. A testing strategy whereby symptomatic students, staff and faculty are identified, administered viral testing, and isolated is effective at controlling transmission. We find that the success of this strategy relies on contact tracing and quarantining most contacts of infected individuals. Screening would have to be performed at least monthly to have much of an impact on the course of the outbreak on campus and increases the sample collection and assay requirements considerably. Overall, we recommend that these results be interpreted qualitatively, since there is considerable uncertainty in these projections stemming from lack of precision of parameter inputs (e.g. true R0 in this population). There are a number of limitations to this modeling analysis, which we outline here. First, we do not make any assumptions about the efficacy of any prevention and control measures aside from testing that are implemented on campus for Fall 2020. Smaller class sizes, staggered class times, use of face coverings, use of other protective equipment and general behavior change are not explicitly accommodated in this model. (16) In that sense, our results are conservative in that we may overestimate risk. We suggest that this is an appropriate baseline scenario for risk-averse planning. Moving more students to off-campus housing has little effect on our projections because we make the assumption that transmission on-campus (R0 = 3.5) is only moderately higher than off campus (R0 = 2.5). This assumption is based on risk factor data on influenza-like illness among students during the 2009 H1N1 outbreak, but if more data become available, we could revisit this assumption. (17) In our model, the campus outbreak cannot go extinct because we assume a constant rate of introduction from the community. Depending on levels of student, staff and faculty behavior off-campus and the general prevalence in the surrounding community (Atlanta metro area in our model), this could be an under-or overestimate of risk. We have not explicitly included a scenario in which all or a subset of students (e.g.., those residing on campus) are screened upon return to campus. Given our assumptions that student prevalence is the same as among the general population, screening on return would have limited effect, but would increase requirements by ~4,500 to 15,000 tests, depending on the breadth of testing of the student body. Finally, we have not included seasonal effects whereby virus becomes more transmissible in Fall or alternative semester dates (e.g.., end of classes at Thanksgiving break) whereby the period of campus transmission is reduced. In conclusion, we present a model of SARS-CoV-2 transmission and control to assist universities in planning potential impacts and resource needs. Our model is conservative in that we assume a high reproductive number that is not reduced through non-pharmaceutical interventions. Despite this, we find that community-introduction of SARS-CoV-2 infection onto campus can be controlled with effective testing, isolation, contract tracing and quarantine, consistent with observations that this strategy has been successful in the general population where implemented properly (e.g. South Korea). (18) The results of this model simulation approach have been influential in Emory University's decision to open in Fall 2020. The University will implement a comprehensive testing strategy and will shorten the semester with an early start, with no breaks in order to end by Thanksgiving, amongst a number of other strategies to suppress transmission. 8% )(4 = 8% )(4 .

67195,"Exponential spread of covid-19 is becoming a threat for human survival and until no treatment is discovered social distancing is the only vaccine. India is the second most populated country in the world [17] and in high population density areas social distancing becomes difficult. One possible solution to tackle this is lockdown. Indian government implemented lockdown very timely and effectively and that controlled the spread of disease significantly. Since the spread of covid is impacting multiple sectors like industry, education, agriculture , health and many more, effective interventions are required which need the projection of spread , in this study we made available different models with different scenarios to project disease with an interactive dashboard. The ecological models were trained on the data downloaded from the ministry of health and welfare website. Building these models involves parameter optimisation, a slight error in a given parameter can lead to error propagation in the final projections. We had therefore used a minimum parameter optimisation. We did an extensive literature review to get a reasonable range of parameters.

67210,"Our analyses based on our proposed LSTM model are divided into two main parts: the prediction models that show predictions of COVID-19 confirmed cases/deaths and evaluations on how well social distancing/mitigation measures are working in the present scenario. In all our plots, dates in January, February, March, April and May are prefixed with 'J', 'F', 'M', 'A' and 'MA' respectively followed by the day of the month. As aforementioned, all modeling is carried out based on the data provided for a specific location. The COVID-19 pandemic affected countries globally and led to an unprecedented number of infections and deaths. Countries took vital steps in mitigating the pandemic by enforcing lockdowns, social distancing, and a variety of other mitigation measures. In this paper, we propose an LSTM based learning model that can learn from the cumulative rise in COVID-19 confirmed cases and deaths and provide valuable insights on how well mitigation measures are working quantitatively in terms of the rate of infections and deaths. The predictions of the model can be helpful for countries deciding to make important decisions regarding the effects of currently implemented mitigation measures and aid in making plans for reopening various places.

67267,"Based on the epidemic of COVID-19 in mainland China, we developed data-driven SEIQR models to investigate the impact of social distancing and epicenter lockdown on the epidemic dynamics. Activating social distancing at the possible earliest time with comprehensive and rigorous measures could significantly reduce the epidemic size of COVID-19. A stepwise implementation of social distancing in the epicenter city first, then in the province, and later the whole nation could be more practical and cost-effective. The . CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0    (which was not peer-reviewed)    decision of epicenter lockdown depends on the primary goal of epidemic control. To minimize the epidemic size and death, the epicenter city should not be locked down. To better confine the epidemic to the origin region, and mitigate the impact on nationwide socio-economy, the epicenter lockdown should be taken earlier. Gratefully, the epidemic in mainland China has been declining steadily, especially in non-Wuhan regions. However, the epidemic out of China may just begin. Several countries, i.e. Korea, Italy, Iran, and Japan, etc. are confronted with an ongoing epidemic outbreak. With caution, the COVID-19 epidemic may even evolve into a global pandemic. Besides, other virulent infectious diseases may attack humans again in the future. We sincerely hope that our work could help the decision-making of epidemic prevention and control strategy for other countries in this COVID-19 epidemic and for future infectious disease epidemics. Tailored and sustainable approaches should be adopted in a different situation, striking a balance among the control of infection and death number, confining epidemic regions, and maintaining socioeconomic vitality.

67295,"COVID-19 infection, first reported in Wuhan, China in December 2019, has become a global pandemic, causing significantly high infections and mortalities in Italy, the UK, the US, and other parts of the world. Based on the statistics reported by John Hopkins University, 4.7M people worldwide and 84,054 people in China have been confirmed positive and infected with COVID-19, as of 18 May 2020. Motivated by the previous studies which show that the exposures to air pollutants may increase the risk of influenza infection, our study examines if such exposures will also affect Covid-19 infection. To the best of our understanding, we are the first group in the world to rigorously explore the effects of outdoor air pollutant concentrations, meteorological conditions and their interactions, and lockdown interventions, on Covid-19 infection in China. Since the number of confirmed cases is likely to be under-reported due to the lack of testing capacity, the change in confirmed case definition, and the undiscovered and unreported asymptotic cases, we use the rate of change in the daily number of confirmed infection cases instead as our dependent variable. Even if the number of reported infections is under-reported, the rate of change will still accurately reflect the relative change in infection, provided that the trend of under-reporting remains the same. In addition, the rate of change in daily infection cases can be distorted by the government imposed public health interventions, including the lockdown policy, inter-city and intra-city mobility, and the change in testing capacity and case definition. Hence, the effects of the lockdown policy and the inter-city and intra-city mobility, and the change in testing capacity and case definition are all taken into account in our statistical modelling. Furthermore, we adopt the generalized linear regression models covering both the Negative Binomial Regression and the Poisson Regression. These two regression models, when combined with different time-lags (to reflect the COVID-19 incubation period and delay due to official confirmation) in air pollutant exposure (PM2.5), are used to fit the COVID-19 infection model. Our statistical study has shown that higher PM2.5 concentration is significantly correlated with a higher rate of change in the daily number of confirmed infection cases in Wuhan, China (p < 0.05). We also determine that a higher dew point interacting with a higher PM2.5 concentration is correlated with a higher rate of change in the daily number of confirmed infection cases, while a higher UV index and a higher PM2.5 concentration are correlated with a lower rate of change. Furthermore, we find that PM2.5 concentration eight days ago has the strongest predictive power for COVID-19 Infection. Our study bears significance to the understanding of the effect of air pollutant (PM2.5) on COVID-19 infection, the interaction effects of both the air pollutant concentration (PM2.5) and the meteorological conditions on the rate of change in infection, as well as the insights into whether lockdown should have an effect on COVID-19 infection."
67360,"In this work, we provide estimations of the key parameters of the dynamics of the COVID-19 epidemic in French regions as well as forecasts according to NPIs especially regarding the proportion of infected when lifting the lockdown policy. The point estimates of the basic reproductive ratios for French regions fluctuated between 2.4 and 3.4 before lockdown took effect, but according to the uncertainty around these estimates they are not substantially different from one region to another. Therefore, observed differences in the number of cases were due to the epicemic starting first in Grand Est and Île-de-France regions. These estimates were close to those reported before isolation using other models (Alizon et al., 2020; Flaxman et al., 2020) . The model provided estimates of the impact of the lockdown on the effective reproductive ratio and although recent data led to a substantial reduction of R e after the lockdown, it remains close to 1 thus without a clear extinction of the epidemic. These estimates should be updated with more recent data that may lead to an estimated R below 1. On the other hand, it is an argument to add other measures such as intensive testing and strict isolation of cases. In addition, the model provides estimates of the size of the population of people who have been or are currently infected. As already reported (Di Domenico et al., 2020a) , this proportion of subjects is around 2 to 4 percent, so excluding any herd immunity and control of the epidemic by having a large proportion of people already infected and therefore not susceptible. With our estimates of basic reproduction ratio, the epidemic would become extinct by herd immunity with a proportion of 89.5% (95% CI [88.0%; 90.7%]) of infected people. Interpretation of our results is conditional on the mechanistic model illustrated in Figure 1 , and careful attention must be given to the parameters set 24 . CC-BY 4.0    "
67373,"We proposed a SEIR model and used the available data 24, 25 to estimate the parameters for the spread of COVID-19 in nine different countries. The time series data, starting from 22nd January to till 2nd April, 2020, for both the developed and developing countries were taken into consideration for the estimation of country-wise parameter values. We then varied the estimated parameter values to see their effect on the course of epidemic in each country. The effect of lockdown and personal hygiene, which affect the human-to-human transmission at the community level and household level, were considered in the model through the parameters β and w. As expected, lockdown and individual hygiene measures had shown their influences in reducing the epidemic burden in all nine countries. Looking at the country-wise prevalence percentage for the next three months, we observed that disease burden will decline in all the four considered European countries except UK. The situation of USA is almost similar to UK, where disease prevalence will be around 25%. At the current infection rate, India and Pakistan will reach their peak with disease prevalence around 60% and 70%, respectively, after 150 and 85 days. Bangladesh will attain its epidemic peak much later. The best part in Bangladesh is that the highest disease prevalence is lower than 9%, which however may be the result of small amount of data availability. We were more interested to see the effect of lockdown and individual precautionary measures on India and Pakistan, though the latter is yet to go for complete lockdown. With the existing contact rate, the epidemic in Pakistan is going to affect around 70% of its population in the coming 3 months, where as 3% of Indian population will be affected by the disease in the same duration. However, the number of infective in India will exponentially grow in the next 2 months and the disease prevalence may be about 60% of the total population. To decrease the prevalence percentage to 0.03% in next 3 months, Pakistan has to reduce the human-to-human transmission rate to one-fifth of the current value, while for India it can be achieved by reducing it to half of the existing rate. Lockdown not only reduces the size of epidemic but also causes delay in the occurrence of peak. The length of delay increases further if the individual level precautionary measures are increased, see Fig. 7 . It is observed that the non-pharmaceutical measures, lockdown, maintaining social distance and individual hygiene, have negative correlation with infective numbers. But none of these can individually decrease the infected population from its current value. They, however, can prevent the outbreak within a period of one month when applied jointly and their measures remain above some threshold values. Our 2D parameter space analysis showed the existence of such parametric region (the green colour portion in Fig 8) even when there is no pharmaceutical intervention. Number of infected population would decrease from its current value after one month if the parameters (β and w) attain their values from the green zone. Though this region is very small, but it could be attainable if every individual strictly follows the lockdown and social distance at the community level and personal hygiene at the household level. Finally, we want to conclude that the number of infected populations is going to increase in India for the next 3 months if human-to-human transmission and personal precautionary measure continue with the existing rates. We can, however, reduce the size of epidemic and prolong the time to arrive at the peak of epidemic by seriously following the measures suggested by the authorities. We need to wait for another one month to obtain more data and epidemiological parameters for giving a better prediction about the pandemic. It is to be mentioned that research community is working for drugs and/ or vaccines against COVID19 and the presence of such pharmaceutical interventions will significantly alter the results.  "
67389,"Recently, a novel coronavirus (COVID-19) has caused viral pneumonia worldwide, spreading to more than 200 countries, posing a major threat to international health. To prevent the spread of COVID-19, in this study, we report that the city lockdown measure was an effective way to reduce the number of new cases, and the nitrogen dioxide (NO2) concentration can be adopted as an environmental lockdown indicator. In China, after strict city lockdown, the average NO2 concentration decreased 55.7% (95% confidence interval (CI): 51.5-59.6%) and the total number of confirmed new cases decreased significantly. We also determined that the global airborne NO2 concentration steeply decreased over the vast majority of COVID-19-hit areas based on satellite measurements. We found that if NO2 emissions significantly decreased, the total number of confirmed new cases reached an inflection point after approximately two weeks. Italy, Germany and France are good examples. Our results suggest that NO2 satellite measurement can help decision makers effectively monitor control regulations to reduce the spread of COVID-19."

67407,"An epidemic disease caused by a new coronavirus has spread in Northern Italy with a strong contagion rate. We implement an SEIR model to compute the infected population and number of casualties of this epidemic. The example may ideally regard the situation in the Italian Region of Lombardy, where the epidemic started on February 25, but by no means attempts to perform a rigorous case study in view of the lack of suitable data and uncertainty of the different parameters, namely, the variation of the degree of home isolation and social distancing as a function of time, the number of initially exposed individuals and infected people, the incubation and infection periods and the fatality rate. First, we perform an analysis of the results of the model, by varying the parameters and initial conditions (in order the epidemic to start, there should be at least one exposed or one infected human). Then, we consider the Lombardy case and calibrate the model with the number of dead individuals to date (April 19, 2020) and constraint the parameters on the basis of values reported in the literature. The peak occurs at day 37 (April 1) approximately, when there is a rapid decrease, with a reproduction ratio R0 = 3 initially, 1.38 at day 22 and 0.64 after day 35, indicating different degrees of lockdown. The predicted death toll is almost 14000 casualties, with 2.4 million infected individuals at the end of the epidemic. The incubation period providing a better fit of the dead individuals is 4.25 days and the infection period is 4 days, with a fatality rate of 0.00144/day [values based on the reported (official) number of casualties]. The infection fatality rate (IFR) is 0.57 %, and 2.36 % if twice the reported number of casualties is assumed. However, these rates depend on the initially exposed individuals. If approximately nine times more individuals are exposed, there are three times more infected people at the end of the epidemic and IFR = 0.47 %. If we relax these constraints and use a wider range of lower and upper bounds for the incubation and infection periods, we observe that a higher incubation period (13 versus 4.25 days) gives the same IFR (0.6 versus 0.57 %), but nine times more exposed individuals in the first case. Therefore, a precise determination of the fatality rate is subject to the knowledge of the characteristics of the epidemic. We plan to perform again these calculations and publish a short note when the epidemic is over and the complete and precise data is available. Besides the specific example, the analysis proposed in this work shows how isolation measures, social distancing and knowledge of the diffusion conditions help us to understand the dynamics of the epidemic. Hence, the importance to quantify the process to verify the effectiveness of the isolation."
67428,"As many country, states, cities, and organizations struggle with the decisions to lift social distancing measures put in place to limit the spread of COVID-19 and reopen economies, it is important to understand the associated risks and plan for appropriate public health measures.

Transmission rate (R ) is the number of newly infected individuals derived from a single case is the factor that can calibrated the reproduction rate of coronavirus utilizing the SIR model. In the traditional SIR model, taking Ro as a constant cannot predict the actual scenario of coronavirus spreading. The value of R can be different for different places and time period. Moreover, Ro can be changed with the behavioral changes of people because of the adopted policies by respective authorities. Therefore, in this research R is not considered a constant rather it is used as a time varying function. By taken the possible measures to reduce the social contact R can be minimized with the time causing less death and forecasting to reopen the economy. "

On April 24, GA reopened some sectors of the economy, with specific guidelines pertinent to social distancing. 3 Nevertheless, given the ongoing SARS-CoV-2 transmission, it is likely we will observe an increase in daily number of new confirmed cases if increased unprotected social mixing ensues as the economy reopens.

67492,"Background: The novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) has rapidly evolved into a global epidemic. To control its spread, countries have implemented non pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs), such as school or border closures, while others have even enforced complete lockdowns. Here we study the impact of NPIs in reducing documented cases of COVID-19. Documented case numbers are selected because they are essential for decision-makers in the area of health-policy when monitoring and evaluating current control mechanisms. Methods: We empirically estimate the relative reduction in the number of new cases attributed to each NPI. A cross-country analysis is performed using documented cases through April 15, 2020 from n=20 countries (i.e., the United States, Canada, Australia, the EU-15 countries, Norway, and Switzerland). Results: As of April 15, venue closures were associated with a reduction in the number of new cases by 36 % (95% credible interval [CrI] 20-48 %), closely followed by gathering bans (34 %; 95% CrI 21-45 %), border closures (31 %; 95% CrI 19-42 %), and work bans on non-essential business activities (31 %; 95% CrI 16-44 %). Event bans lead to a slightly less pronounced reduction (23 %; 95% CrI 8-35 %). School closures (8 %; 95% CrI 0-23 %) and lockdowns (5 %; 95% CrI 0-14 %) appeared to be the least effective among the NPIs considered in this analysis. Conclusions: With this cross-country analysis, we provide early estimates regarding the impact of different NPIs for controlling the COVID-19 epidemic. These findings are relevant for evaluating current health-policies.

67556,"The different spatiotemporal clustering patterns between COVID-19 and SARS could point to changes in social and demographic factors, local government containment strategies or differences in transmission mechanisms between these coronaviruses. . CC-BY 4.0    Compared to the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak in 2003, which was also caused by a similar coronavirus, COVID-19 has been much more transmissible and rapidly spread from a single city to the entire country in just 30 days [2] . The estimated basic reproductive numbers (R0s) for COVID-19 and SARS were approximately 3.1 [3] and 2.7 [4] , respectively. The transmission mechanisms of COVID-19 are currently poorly understood, although this disease is considered to be one of the most widespread and destructive infectious diseases. There is a need for a more integrated investigation and coordinated international response to the outbreak. Spatiotemporal analyses, which integrate spatial and time-series analyses, can provide additional information on the persistence of patterns over time and illuminate any unusual patterns. Therefore, in this study, by collecting the daily numbers of newly confirmed COVID-19 and SARS cases during the two epidemics, we aimed to determine the spatial behavior and temporal features of the COVID-19 spread in mainland China and compared then with the respective features from the SARS epidemic using . CC-BY 4.0    ()  .   5 spatiotemporal analysis. In our study, we found that there were different spatiotemporal clustering patterns between COVID-19 and SARS. Compared to SARS, COVID-19 had a higher incidence as well as wider and faster transmission in mainland China. The significant high-risk areas for COVID-19 were predominantly clustered in south-central China, around Hubei, from Jan. 28 to Feb. 18. Additionally, our results showed that the quarantine measure taken in Hubei might have played a crucial role in restricting the infected areas, shortening the epidemic period, and reducing the national infected risk of the disease. The 2003 SARS outbreaks represented one of the most serious public health challenges to China and the world [12] . Seventeen years later, the outbreak of COVID-19 could encounter a similar situation but lead to a different outcome. The different transmission mechanisms of these coronaviruses can also present different spatial and temporal distributions nationally and globally. For SARS, we observed that the distance transmission chain started from Guangdong to Beijing and the nearby provinces. However, for COVID-19, we observed a shorter transmission chain around Hubei but a wider infected region nationally. Outside the epicenter, we identified more secondary clusters for SARS, which indicated that the transmission was wider for second generations. Compared to SARS, the secondary clusters of COVID-19 were mainly clustered around Hubei. This could be explained by the relatively high infection rate nationally, as well as the different demographic factors and local government containment strategies regionally. Another secondary cluster identified in Shandong around Feb. 20 was mainly due to the newly reported cases previously identified in jails [13] . Because the reporting system of the jails was independent from the national . CC-BY 4.0    "

67602,"The COVID-19 is spreading world-wide but stopped spreading in China. Since the spread of the disease is highly related to population migration, it follows a Lévy flight behavior which is characteristic of human mobility [21] . The long incubating period together with the Lévy flight long jumps makes the disease very hard to control and raise the alarm for the other countries. By the time that infected individual is being detectable, one can already perform a long-distance trip and further spread the disease. In fact, the strong relation of population migration and the disease spreading indicates that early quarantine of Hubei province could prevent the worldwide spreading. This is the reason why quarantines are so critical not only for infected persons, but also for others that were nearby infected individuals. The lifetime of the disease in a city is characterized by two stages, uncontrolled infection in early times and decaying stage at later times once quarantines are being performed. These two stages can explain the disease situation in China and predict the situation in other locations in the world if similar strategies will be adopted. Our results suggest that early action may attenuate the disease propagation and prevent overload of the health system which may not be ready for the large amount of unexpected new patients. The stage of the disease in China is almost stable although it was the country with most of infection cases up to the middle of March 2020. The reasoning is that most of the infected cities in China applied strict quarantine measures, leading to exponential decay of disease. However, in other locations around the world, most of the cities are still at the early stages at which the disease is less controlled and may lead to another or even worse outbreak at high risks. "

Along the similar argument, we show that the transmission rate and basic reproduction number R 0 for India are in the expected range. This is contrary to several reports questioning the testing strategies adopted by India quoting a low transmission rate and hence the smaller basic reproduction number. Two epidemiological models -a simple exponential model and an SIR model, are used respectively to forecast short and long term outcomes. These models assume all the seed cases to be symptomatic, which may underestimate the actual numbers due to an uncertain number of asymptomatic individuals. With this limitation, the exponential model based on data till March 23 nicely predicts the values till today (March 30). The SIR model based on data till March 30 indicates that India will enter equilibrium by the end of May with an estimated total number of infected cases to be approximately 13,000. It is estimated that the impact of social distancing will be visible after April 8 following which we may see a significant reduction in the reported infections. However, India is on high risk to enter into community transmission due to reported violation of quarantine norms by individuals as well as other social and demographic issues. The predictions made using the current epidemiological models in the current work will be invalid if such an event occurs. Finally, the model is as good as the underlying data. Because of real time change in data daily, the predictions will accordingly change. Hence, the results from this paper should be used only for qualitative understanding and reasonable estimate of the nature of outbreak, but are not advisable for any decision making or policy change.

67674,"A novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, has caused a pandemic of COVID-19. The evolutionary trend of the virus genome may have implications for infection control policy but remains obscure. We introduce an estimation of fold change of translational efficiency based on synonymous variant sites to characterize the adaptation of the virus to hosts. The increased translational efficiency of the M and N genes suggests that the population of SARS-CoV-2 benefits from mutations toward favored codons, while the ORF1ab gene has slightly decreased the translational efficiency. In the coding region of the ORF1ab gene upstream of the −1 frameshift site, the decreasing of the translational efficiency has been weakening parallel to the growth of the epidemic, indicating inhibition of synthesis of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and promotion of replication of the genome. Such an evolutionary trend suggests that multiple infections increased virulence in the absence of social distancing."

This uncertainty is inherent to the SARS-Cov-2 pandemic, as can be viewed by the fact that R 0 has been ranging in the literature from 1.4 to 7.23 [7, 8] . We show that our approach provides a good fit for the COVID-19 cases in these locations. Our approach demonstrates that the end of social distancing will be around October 2020, under mild assumptions. 12 . CC-BY 4.0    "
67724,"The spread of SARS-CoV-2 since December 2019 has become a pandemic and impacted many aspects of human society. Here, we analyzed genetic variation of SARS-CoV-2 and its related coronavirus and found the evidence of intergenomic recombination. After correction for mutational bias, analysis of 137 SARS-CoV-2 genomes as of 2/23/2020 revealed the excess of low frequency mutations on both synonymous and nonsynonymous sites which is consistent with recent origin of the virus. In contrast to adaptive evolution previously reported for SARS-CoV in its brief epidemic in 2003, our analysis of SARS-CoV-2 genomes shows signs of relaxation of selection. The sequence similarity of the spike receptor binding domain between SARS-CoV-2 and a sequence from pangolin is probably due to an ancient intergenomic introgression. Therefore, SARS-CoV-2 might have cryptically circulated within humans for years before being recently noticed. Data from the early outbreak and hospital archives are needed to trace its evolutionary path and reveal critical steps required for effective spreading. Two mutations, 84S in orf8 protein and 251V in orf3 protein, occurred coincidentally with human intervention. The 84S first appeared on 1/5/2020 and reached a plateau around 1/23/2020, the lockdown of Wuhan. 251V emerged on 1/21/2020 and rapidly increased its frequency. Thus, the roles of these mutations on infectivity need to be elucidated. Genetic diversity of SARS-CoV-2 collected from China was two time higher than those derived from the rest of the world. In addition, in network analysis, haplotypes collected from Wuhan city were at interior and have more mutational connections, both of which are consistent with the observation that the outbreak of cov-19 was originated from China.

67734,"It must be noted that the congregation, that impacted the social distancing pattern, had happened in the middle of March. Given that the incubation period of this virus, that is the number of days between contracting the virus and showing symptoms, is around 6 days. It was only after the 1 st April 2020 that news about this single source event started emerging and they were traced and tested which is caused a sudden spike in the number of infected cases in our country. This clearly shows that the attendees of the congregation were not tested in the first week of the lock-down 1.0 lest the number would have spiked early on, between March 23 and 30. In figure 1 we depict the ratio between the number of infected cases and the number of tests conducted. There are two trends shown in the figure. The blue trend line is the ratio taken for individual days and the orange trend line is ratio of the cumulative numbers. This ratio of new cases to total test, although too simplistic, yet indicates the need for more tests to be carried out if the ratio appears constant or increases over a period of time. In case this ratio trend line has even a light negative slope, it gives an early indication on the containment of the virus. From the figure we see that in both the trend lines, there is a significant spike in the first week of April, precisely on April 01 and 02, 2020. This is an early indication about the disruption in the social contact pattern. .

67766,"The results suggest that the rate of Covid-19 positive deaths in Wales and the UK have peaked, although there is predicted significant mortality in the coming weeks and months, consistent with multiple other forecast models of Covid-19 [9] . The situation is different in North Wales, where there remains significant uncertainty concerning the timing of peak mortality. Concerns that the incidence of new cases may be rising at a higher rate than the remainder of Wales, and the ≥2 week lag in mortality implies that reducing current controls on population movement may be detrimental to the region's population health. The fragility of rural North Wales in dealing with Covid-19 in the context of substantial increases in holidaymakers and second home residents is significant. The May 10 th announcement of the relaxation in the lockdown for England, included freedom for exercise and outdoor activity, ""irrespective of distance"".   ()   .   6 Whether this includes travel to Wales and other parts of the UK is unclear -the Welsh Government has ruled that stopping people breaking Welsh coronavirus lockdown laws is not a ""real option"". Our analysis has strengths in consideration of multiple sigmoidal growth functions, contrasting with many others, including the influential Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation modelling which relies on a single model, namely the ERF error function. Their approach has been criticised as predictions are extremely labile since new data are included on a daily basis [10] . Neither our model nor the IHME model is a disease transmission model, and this represents a limitation. Although in predicting mortality (as opposed to cases), SEIR compartmental models (representing susceptible, exposed, infectious, recovered) may be less reliable. Model averaging benefits from possible reduction of predictive error. However the confidence bounds for averaged models are not readily calculable, hence our presentation of the range of outputs from each individual model as a conservative estimate. A further limitation relates to the data, as not all Covid-19 deaths are reported in NHS and Government figures. Estimations of excess mortality in relation to historic data for the months of March to May should provide a more robust estimate, and which are inclusive also of wider impacts of hospital pressures and cancellation of elective procedures. In conclusion, policies governing the movement of people in the gradual release from lockdown are likely to impact significantly on areas -principally rural in nature -where cases of Covid-19, deaths and immunity are likely to be much lower than in populated areas. This is particularly difficult to manage across jurisdictions, such as between England and Wales, and for popular holiday destinations. "
67771,"We consider a simple model for the COVID-19 pandemic to analyse the relative effectiveness of several stages of the lockdown in Belgium, as well as of several phases of its relaxation.

67826,"The present analysis, based on the daily reported confirmed cases of COVID-19, suggests that there has virtually been little impact of the nationwide lockdown and subsequent extension and relaxation in restrictions on the progress of the COVID-19 epidemic in India. There has also been little empirical evidence to suggest that relaxation in the restrictions under the third and the fourth phase of the nation-wide lockdown has resulted in spiking the reported confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the country. The analysis also suggests that if the trend in the reported confirmed cases of COVID-19 during the period 4 April through 21 May 2020 continues in the immediate future, then the daily reported confirmed cases of COVID-19 is likely to increase to around 21 thousand by 15 June 2020 whereas the total number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 will increase to around 422 thousand. This trend can be changed or reverted by introducing appropriate interventions that may help in containing the spread of the disease. In this context, population-wide testing for COVID-19 along with isolation of positive cases and contacts to the positive cases appears to be the need of the time. reuse, remix, or adapt this material for any purpose without crediting the original authors. preprint () in the Public Domain.

67836,"On March 11, 2020 the World Health Organization (WHO) had declared SARS-CoV-2 pandemic; and at present there are over 6 million cases across the globe. Based on the interim guidelines of WHO, most of the countries opted for social distancing with lockdown as the only way to control the pandemic. This led to Manufacturing shut down, which acted as a spanner in the wheel for international supply chain leading to pressure on governments to review the protocols of the lockdown. We studied epidemiological parameters for 18 countries and obtained crossover time point referring to cumulative case active and case recovery rates and the time point for the peak positive confirmation rate in a time window of 92 days; and linked with the respective governmental decisions. For countries awaiting crossover, time series non-linear models could be used for predicting the crossover point. A sample study was carried out for India. The median time for reaching crossover for 12 countries was 37 days, while peak positive confirmation rate was 30 days after their first intervention. These countries enforced strict lockdown regulations and have shown constant improvement in their recovery rate even after crossover time point. A phase wise relaxation of lockdown is evident after crossover point in most of these countries. The crossover time point with the subsequent increasing recovery rate can be a strategy for lockdown relaxation as evident from the experiences of few countries. Also, we propose a criterion based on cumulative recovery and fatality rate for micro-management of lockdown."
68048,"Due to the recent diffusion of COVID-19 outbreak, the scientific community is making efforts in analysing models for understanding the present situation and predicting future scenarios. In this paper, we propose a Susceptible-Infected-Exposed-Recovered-Dead (SEIRD) differential model [Weitz J. S. and Dushoff J., Scientific reports, 2015] for the analysis and forecast of the COVID-19 spread in Italian regions, using the data from the Italian Protezione Civile from February 24th 2020. In this study, we investigate an adaptation of SEIRD that takes into account the actual policies of the Italian government, consisting of modelling the infection rate as a time-dependent function (SEIRD(rm)). Preliminary results on Lombardia and Emilia-Romagna regions confirm that SEIRD(rm) fits the data more accurately than the original SEIRD model with constant rate infection parameter. Moreover, the increased flexibility in the choice of the infection rate function makes it possible to better control the predictions due to the lockdown policy."
68063,"Our results show an early deceleration in the spread of COVID-19, probably resulting from personal hygiene and social distancing recommendations that preceded the enforcement of the nationwide lockdown in most regions (see also Santamaría & Hortal 2020). The nationwide lockdown marks a clear turning point in the apparent reproductive number: the strongest decrease in Rt detected in all regions follows such enforcement (see also Tobías 2020). However, in nine regions the decrease in Rt that preceded the nationwide lockdown was interrupted by increases in Rt values (most notably Aragón, Castilla-La Mancha, Navarra and Extremadura). It is likely that these increments are related to the increases in inter-regional mobility from the most affected regions (Madrid, Catalonia, Basque Country and La Rioja; see Maxxoli et al. 2020) , triggered by local lockdown measures (such as the closure of schools and universities in Madrid and parts of Basque Country, in March 11) that unwittingly incentivized the migration of students and wealthy citizens to family homes and second residences (a response observed also in other countries, such as France and the US; Onishi and Méheut, 2020; Hoffower 2020). .

68083,"Our study builds on the recent emerging epidemiological data supporting the efficacy of NPIs, and specific to our study, stay-at-home mandates, in the control of the COVID-19 pandemic. 6, 17, 16, [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] Our analysis supports a protective effect of earlier implementation of stay-athome orders both globally and within US states. Notably, when the timing of mandate implementation was analyzed as a continuous variable, the effect on timing to peak case and death counts was modest with an increase in the time to peak of approximately one day. By contrast, a relatively strong effect was demonstrated when we evaluated regions categorized as late mandate implementers, corresponding to the largest predicted prolongation in the number of days to peak daily case and death counts. This strong association supports the possibility of a ""threshold"" date or range of dates only until which an implemented mandate may be efficacious. Strengths of this study include the temporality of the interventions and outcomes included in our analysis, which supports biological plausibility. Furthermore, our study included multiple iterations of analyses to support the observed trend. Our findings were replicated for both US states as well as for our included countries, which supports the consistency of the observed effect.

68090,"The Spanish government declared the lockdown on March 14th, 2020 to tackle the fast-spreading of COVID-19. As a consequence the Balearic Islands remained almost fully isolated due to the closing of airports and ports, These isolation measures and the home-based confinement have led to a low incidence of COVID-19 in this region. We propose a compartmental model for the spread of COVID-19 including five compartments (Susceptible, Latent, Infected, Diseased, and Recovered), and the mobility between municipalities. The model parameters are calibrated with the temporal series of confirmed cases provided by the Spanish Ministry of Health. After calibration, the proposed model captures the trend of the official confirmed cases before and after the lockdown. We show that the estimated number of cases depends strongly on the initial dates of the local outbreak onset and the number of imported cases before the lockdown. Our estimations indicate that the population has not reached the level of herd immunization necessary to prevent future outbreaks. While the low incidence, in comparison to mainland Spain, has prevented the saturation of the health system, this low incidence translates into low immunization rates, therefore facilitating the propagation of new outbreaks that could lead to secondary waves of COVID-19 in the region. These findings warn about scenarios regarding after-lockdown-policies and the risk of second outbreaks, emphasize the need for widespread testing, and could potentially be extrapolated to other insular and continental regions."
68118,"We believe that especially the two results shown in Figure is that what really matters is not to keep everyone at home (""Italian approach"") but rather to impede virus transmission (""German approach""), e.g., by wearing masks, adequate hygiene, and social distancing. Infection transmission does not strongly increase upon easing as long as face masks and social distancing prevent SARS-CoV-2 virus spreading. One should add at this point -an important fact that appears to be currently inadequately understandthat, along with a less pleasant effect of a short-term slight increase of the daily new cases, a moderate increase in the infection rate also has a positive impact. It reduces epidemic duration; compare the right tail the green and orange curves in Figure 3b . (ii) The fact that the carrying capacity N does not change upon lockdown easing is equally important. This is the maximum number of individuals that can be infected in a given environment. Rephrasing, the maximum number of infected individuals does not increase when the lockdown is released; the total carrying capacity of a given environment does not change. From a methodological perspective, one should emphasize the important technical strength of the approach proposed above, which made it possible to arrive at the aforementioned conclusions.

68124,"Here we present the main findings of the study and the predictions of the standard SEIRD and Distancing-SEIRD models. First, we depict the short-term and longer-term fits to the country-wide data for Canada and China, as well as the fits to COVID-19 epidemiological data from Quebec and Ontario. We use the parameter fits to inform the Distancing-SEIRD model to ultimately make long-term predictions about the impact of social distancing strategies on the dynamics of the pandemic in Quebec and Ontario. The fits to the epidemiological data for China and Canada, obtained with the standard SEIRD model, are depicted in Figure 3 . The full fitting process is described in the Supplementary Information Section B.2. The process involves estimating key parameters from the raw epidemiological data and using machine learning techniques to optimize the remaining parameters. Figure 3 illustrates that the SEIRD model captured the overall trends in the number of infected individuals, the total number of deaths, and the number of recovered individuals. Importantly, with a suitable and realistic choice of parameters, the model captured the peak and the tail of the longer-term temporal data from China. Note that while the data fits for the infected curve for Canada (Figure 3 b) show quantitative disagreement, the qualitative dynamics of the curve are captured. Importantly, the deceased and recovered curves fit the data quite well. As discussed in Section 2, in the early dynamics of the epidemic at the national or provincial level the epidemic does not evolve as a single outbreak, but rather as the sum of multiple outbreaks in multiple cities with temporal delay. As a result, a model like Eq. (A.1) ought not to perfectly fit these early dynamics. In fact, if we did not set some of the parameters with epidemiological insights (as described in the Supplementary Information Section B.2) we could achieve stricter quantitative fits of 4 . CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0    Mathematical models of pandemic progression can serve as a useful tool for policy-makers crafting a societal pandemic response. If used correctly, they can also serve as tools for persuading the general public on best practices for controlling the virus' spread. One of the main tactics the public can employ to combat the virus is social distancing: limiting the amount of social interaction in order to lower the effective transmission rate. Unfortunately, the widespread use of social distancing can cause many economic, social, and personal challenges, leading some to question the value of social distancing in achieving pandemic control. Naturally, questions arise regarding how many people must social distance, and for how long, in order for these tactics to be effective. In this work, an epidemiological mathematical model, the Distancing-SEIRD model, is developed for use in predicting the effectiveness of various social distancing strategies in Canada. Disease parameters are fitted to the model using machine learning techniques for the specific cases of Ontario and Quebec and used to project the number of deaths and ventilator demand for proposed social distancing strategies. Social distancing strategies are defined by the proportion of the population social distancing and the length of time over which social distancing occurs. Allowing for a proportion of the population to social distance, rather than all-or-nothing, allows for the more realistic case of imperfect social distancing to be modelled. "

68173,"In the absence of any pharmacological intervention, one approach to slowing the COVID-19 pandemic is reducing the contact rate in the population through social distancing. Governments the world over have instituted different measures to increase social distancing but information on their effectiveness in reducing mobility is lacking. We analyzed the mobility data from 41 cities to look at the effect of these interventions. The median mobility across cities on March 2, 2020 was 100% (IQR: 94%, 107%), which decreased to a median of 10% (IQR: 7%, 17%) on March 26, 2020. We found that the mobility decreased on average by 3.4% (95%CI: 3.3%, 3.6%) per day from March 2 through March 26. Social distancing measures decreased the mobility by an additional 23% (95%CI: 20%, 27%). Our study provides initial evidence for the reduction in mobility in cities instituting social distancing measures."
68192,"Here we introduce a mathematical model, based on demographic and clinical data that 381 enables evaluating the relative benefit of social distancing and massive testing. Using this 382 simple model, we investigate scenarios of COVID-19 evolution in two types of 383 representative cities (i.e., 3,500,000 inhabitants and 5,000 hab km 2 , and 5.0 X 10 6 384 inhabitants and 10,000 hab km 2 ). 385 Our modeling simulations show that for Type-I cities, extreme and sustained social 386 distancing (i.e., effectively decreasing the demographic density by 60% or more) may design/redesign of urban areas.

68243,"In this report we utilise a semi-mechanistic Bayesian model of COVID-19 transmission, calibrated using data on reported deaths at the state level, to infer the epidemiological characteristics of the epidemic in Brazil to date. The results presented here suggest an ongoing epidemic in which substantial reductions in the average reproduction number have been achieved through non-pharmaceutical interventions. However our results also show that so far the changes in mobility have not been stringent enough to reduce the reproduction number below 1. Therefore we predict continued growth of the epidemic across Brazil and increases in the associated number of cases and deaths unless further actions are taken. Our results reveal extensive heterogeneity in predicted attack rates between states, suggesting that the epidemic is at a far more advanced stage in some states compared to others. Despite this heterogeneity however, in no states do any of our results indicate that herd immunity is close to being reached, underscoring the early stage of the epidemic in Brazil currently, and the prospect of the situation worsening unless further control measures are implemented. The estimated attack rates are calculated from the reported number of deaths.

68257,"School closures alone hardly impact the epidemic curve. Immediate social distancing measures that reduce non-household contacts by over 75% were required to ensure that COVID-19 cases do not overwhelm local hospital surge capacity. These findings Introduction A novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) appeared in Wuhan, China in December 2019 and was declared a pandemic on March 11, 2020 by the World Health Organization (WHO) [1] . As of March 28, 2020, 191 countries, areas, or territories have reported a total of 571,659 confirmed COVID-19 cases and 26,493 deaths, with substantial outbreaks emerging in Italy, the Republic of Korea, Iran, and the United States, which surpassed China to become the country with the highest cumulative confirmed cases [2, 3] . The US reported its first imported SARS-CoV-2 case from Wuhan on January 20, 2020 in Washington state [4] , 6 and 40 days ahead of California and New York City [5, 6] , and its first locally-infected cases on February 28, 2020 [7] . The number of confirmed cases has continued to grow exponentially [8] . As of March 26, 2020 , all 50 states have reported confirmed cases, 27 have reported community spread and the cumulative confirmed COVID-19 cases are 68,440 with 994 total deaths [8] . Surges in COVID-19 hospitalizations are undermining local healthcare systems in New York and Seattle [9, 10] . In order to contain the spread of SARS-CoV-2, cities have implemented social distancing measures at multiple scales, including school closures, limiting mass gatherings, issuing stay at home orders, imposing travel restrictions, and banning non-essential commercial activities. As of March 28, 2020, 26 states have issued a statewide shelter-in-place order or have at least one city-level stay-at-home order, affecting over 229 million people [11] . However, the timing of interventions has been idiosyncratic and many cities have yet to enact substantial social distancing orders [12, 13] . As COVID-19 emerged into a global threat, we took a national pandemic influenza model that was built through a pandemic preparedness contract with the CDC and adapted it to model the spread and control of COVID-19 within and between 217 US cities. We used this model to project the potential impact of school closures coupled with social distancing, in terms of reducing cases, deaths, hospitalizations, ICU visits, and ventilator needs, on local, regional and national scales. Here, we have focused our analysis on the city of Austin, which is the capital of Texas and the fastest growing city in the US [14, 15] . as a representation of major US metropolitan areas. The scenarios and inputs (e.g., epidemiological parameters) were determined in consultation with the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the city of Regional Healthcare System Executive Council of the Austin-Travis County Emergency Operations Command. As COVID-19 emerged as a global threat in early 2020, we rapidly adapted a pandemic influenza model that was under development as part of an effort coordinated by the US CDC to build a strategic national modeling resource for pandemic planning and response. The analyses presented herein originated in time-sensitive requests from the CDC, the city of Austin, and the state of Texas to evaluate the potential impact of school closures and social distancing on the emergence and spread of COVID-19 in US cities. Our projections indicate that without extensive social distancing measures, the emerging outbreak will quickly surpass healthcare capacity in the region. However, with extensive social distancing, the number of cases, hospitalizations, and deaths can be substantially reduced throughout the summer of 2020. Although these analyses are .

68270,"Our analysis suggests that quarantine greatly reduced the number of cases and deaths seen in Hubei's COVID-19 outbreak. In addition, while quarantine does not appear in the representation of R 0 , it still indirectly reduces R 0 . We also saw that the dynamics of the outbreak is very sensitive to the quarantine rate s q and contact rate β, as indicated by our sensitivity analysis. The basic reproductive number is estimated as 5.49 and the study shows that any change in β or i q directly affects the basic reproductive number. The quarantine decidedly reduces the number of cases and deaths. Increasing (or decreasing) the speed of movement from the susceptible class to the quarantine class by about 10% would double (or half) the number of cases and deaths due to the outbreak (This speed of movement is controlled by the rate s q ). Of course, the efficiency of the quarantine is also very important. In our model, the efficiency of the quarantine measured by the reduction rate, r. The reduction rate shows how much reduction is effected in the contact of COVID-19 thanks to the quarantine. Based on our sensitivity analysis, this parameter is very important (see Figure 6 ). Our model shows that the quarantine in Hubei was almost perfect since it caused about 98.9 percent reduction in the contact rate of COVID-19. Another important parameter that plays a crucial role in the dynamics of the outbreak is the rate of reported (infected) cases i q which is directly related to the number of tests given to detect infected individuals. Similar to the quarantine rate s q , the rate of reported (infected) cases i q could double (half) when we have 10% reduction (or increase) in the rate. As of 30 March 2020, there were no reported cases in Hubei in the past week and the total number of cases and total number of deaths were 67801 and 3187, respectively. Based on our 15-days forecasting, the number of cases in Hubei was projected to be about 67994 and the number of deaths was projected to be about 3254. Thus, we estimate the fatality rate of the outbreak to be about 4.8% in Hubei. Our model gives about 6% relative error and we are confident that using the model will be helpful for forecasting local outbreaks of the pandemic in other regions. From existing COVID-19 data from Turkey and the dynamics of our model understood from the Hubei analysis, the outbreak in Turkey is expected to reach its peak between April 20 and April 26 depending on the number of individuals (amount of people) in quarantine and the number of COVID-19 tests carried out each day in Turkey. The daily number of tests given in Turkey is large when we compare to the rates of reported cases in Hubei. As we showed in the sensitivity analysis, increasing the number of COVID-19 tests and the number of individuals in quarantine will significantly reduce the number of cases (and deaths). Based on our forecasting, the number of cases will be about 203,700 with the range 148,100 and 281,500, and the number of deaths will be about 8,269 with the range 6,005 and 11,430 depending on quarantine rate, s q and the rate of reported cases, i q in Turkey. Thus, in any cases that are given in Figure 9 and 10, the fatality rate of COVID-19 will be about 4.1% in Turkey. .

Since then Chile has accumulated a total of 14365 cases as of April 28th, 2020. We estimate the reproduction number during the early transmission phase in Chile and study the effectiveness of control interventions by conducting short-term forecasts based on early transmission dynamics of COVID-19. The incidence curve displays sub-exponential growth dynamics with the scaling of growth parameter, p, estimated at 0.8 (95% CI: 0.7, 0.8) and the reproduction number estimated at 1.6 (95% CI: 1.5, 1.6). The sub-epidemic model indicates a stationary wave of stable epidemic size. Our current findings point to sustained transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in Chile. While the social distancing interventions have slowed the virus spread, the number of new COVID-19 cases continue to accrue, underscoring the need for persistent social distancing efforts to control the epidemic."

This underlies the fact that lockdown alone is not enough to stop the epidemic in India and other measures such as extensive testing, contact tracing and isolation of COVID-19 positve subjects is essential. Limitations of the estimation include poor testing rate and variations in testing rate between states. Since enough data is not publicly available to estimate generation time for COVID-19, the generation time reported by a study from China was used and this could limit the accuracy of the estimates for the reprodcution number.

68373,"The wide territorial, demographic, infrastructural diversity of mainland countries as Brazil demands an epidemic modeling of the COVID-19 with geographical resolution higher than usual compartmental epidemic models, which can be achieved using the metapopulation framework. Performing simulations of COVID-19 epidemics at municipality level for Brazil with diverse mitigation scenarios (none, moderate, and strong) and considering the integration of different regions through long distance mobility of persons, we have identified a high degree of heterogeneity and desynchronization of the epidemic curves in the main metropolitan areas and countryside regions. The diversity of outcomes is observed in several geographical scales from states to immediate regions, that encloses groups of nearby municipalities with strong economic and social ties. The stronger mitigation attitudes the more remarkable are the differences. We found moderate or strong correlation between the delay of the epidemic peak in countryside regions when compared with the capital cities of the respective state for most of states with well connected immediate regions. However, one exception was PR state where diverse epidemic foci evolving apparently independently of the capital city. The administrative organization of Brazil gives to the federative state and municipalities some independence to adopt mitigation approaches but are limited by the economic dependence on superior spheres. So, the tendency is to have similar approaches within states. Our simulations indicate that uniform mitigation measures may not be the optimal strategy. In a municipality where the peak naturally happens after the capital of its state, it will delay even more if strong mitigation measures are adopted synchronously with the capital. On the one hand, such a municipality probably would have to extend the mitigation for much longer periods since once the epicenters of epidemics start to relax their restrictions the viruses would circulate faster, reaching these vulnerable municipalities with essentially the entire population still susceptible. The social and economic impacts could be higher. On the other hand, an eventual collapse of the local heath system in countryside regions could also occur after the larger metropolitan areas were under control paving the possibility of unburdening the local healthy care system. Actually, the desynchronization of the epidemic curves and consequently of the sanitary systems' collapse can be used as an important ally in the prospection of optimal resource distributions. One important attitude is to preserve these reservoirs in countryside as long as possible. It could be done in at least two forms. The first one is reducing to a lowest possible level the flux of people from areas with high incidence of COVID-19, in other words, strict sanitary cordons in the epidemic epicenters. This approach is theoretically obvious but can hardly be achieved in practice and only Wuhan had success in this endeavor [5] . The second option is to flatten the curves as much as possible in the . CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0    ()  .   main metropolitan regions. Beyond the positive consequences for their own sanitary systems, this attitude would have the positive side effect of delaying epidemics in the countryside. Our study points that countryside regions are not safe in medium-term but have a precious additional time to be prepared. Not less important, a constant monitoring of possible local transmission by massive testing policies [36] even without significant epidemic incidence still is the only safe path to keep countryside economically active while others epidemic epicenters are locked down.

68378,"The primary data for Covid-19 pandemic is in the form of time series for the number of confirmed, recovered and dead cases. This data is updated every day and is available for most countries from multiple sources. In this work we present a two step procedure for model fitting to Covid-19 data. In the first step, time dependent transmission coefficients are constructed directly from the data and, in the second step, measures of those (minimum, maximum, mean, median etc.,) are used to set priors for fitting models to data. We call this approach a ""data driven approach"" or ""data first approach"". This scheme is complementary to Bayesian approach and can be used with or without that for parameter estimation. We use the procedure to fit a set of SIR and SIRD models, with time dependent contact rate, to Covid-19 data for a set of 45 most affected countries. We find that SIR and SIRD models with constant transmission coefficients cannot fit Covid-19 data for most countries (mainly because social distancing, lockdown etc., make those time dependent). We find that any time dependent contact rate, which falls gradually with time, can help to fit SIR and SIRD models for most of the countries. We also present constraints on transmission coefficients and basic reproduction number R0~ as well as effective reproduction number R(t). The main contributions of our work are as follows. (1) presenting a two step procedure for model fitting to Covid-19 data (2) constraining transmission coefficients as well as R0~ and R(t), for a set of most affected countries and (3) releasing a python package PyCov19 that can used to fit a set of compartmental models with time varying coefficients to Covid-19 data."
68414,"Since the outbreak of novel coronavirus, Government of India took a series quick actions and as a part of it announced a nationwide lockdown on March 25 th 2020. Measures like social distancing, covering face and nose, maintaining hygiene and avoiding public gathering were made compulsory. The measures were to ensure the break of human chain for transmission and thus ultimately tackle the SARS CoV-2 spread. The government has been trying to beat Covid-19 at two fronts, one, flatten the curve of coronavirus positive cases and second, to restrict the exponential growth in the number of positive cases [14] . However with the announcement of first unlock on June 1 st 2020, the statistics are bound to change. This study, has thus, tried to show how India's numbers have behaved since lockdown to till June 10 th i.e. 10 days into the unlocked India and the strategies used by Government of India to counter Covid-19. The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare stated on June 12 th that India's doubling rate of Covid-19 cases has increased from 3.4 days when lockdown began (March 25 th ) to 17.4 days currently [15] . Along with it India's active cases rate and case fatality rate are decreasing whereas recovery rate is showing an upward trend since the outbreak. At present, recovery rate is higher than active cases rate, however this is not the point to let our guards down as the peak is yet to reach of the pandemic. Also, recovery rates talks about cumulative/accumulated numbers whereas active rate give the current situation thus making them non-comparable [16] . Simultaneously, an analysis of the current situation in terms of new active cases and new recovered cases (in the duration of 10 days from unlock 1.0), the situation is opposite, the active cases are more than recovered cases [17] . .

68436,"Strict social distancing policies, enforced to contain the COVID-19 outbreak, will have to be relaxed to prevent excessive damage to society and the economy. However, this must be achieved while avoiding a resurgent disease outbreak [21] . Contact tracing is one of the key measures for reducing the risk of subsequent epidemic waves, while allowing social distancing measures to be eased. Contact tracing needs to be fast and scalable to effectively disrupt infection chains (see [7] and SI Appendix Section S3 D). Digital contact tracing via smartphone applications makes this possible, but raises the question of which among the many detected contacts to notify [13] . This problem hinges on an inherent trade-off: the lower the notification threshold, the greater the disease control, but the more healthy individuals sent unnecessarily to quarantine. In this work, we embedded a compartmental model for COVID-19 disease progression, in a modeling framework that captures testing and digital contact tracing. Our results indicate that saturated testing capacities, and the consequence of less effective contact tracing, lead to an acceleration of the epidemic and more severe long-term outcomes. This suggests that the model can serve as a basis for quantitative studies on the role of limited PCR-testing during the spread of COVID-19. Our model introduces a mechanistic description of contact tracing in a compartmental model, which, guided by an asymptotic analysis, makes a dominant contribution at the disease free equilibrium and thus features in the basic reproduction number. This allowed us to derive contact tracing precision from the underlying process rather than prescribing an exogenous efficacy a priori [8, 7] . We investigated outbreak mitigation and prevention as a function of social intervention measures, contact tracing adoption (Figure 3 left), initial population immunity (Figure 3 right), testing rates (SI Appendix Section S3 A) and capacities (Figure 2 ), delays in contact notification (SI Appendix Section S3 D), and the notification threshold (Figure 4 left) . The complex interplay in this high-dimensional parameter space highlights the practical challenge of achieving disease control. We emphasise that, when the outbreak is not preventable, contact tracing remains an important public safety measure: in many circumstances, every person who signs up to the contact tracing application saves another from infection (see SI Appendix Section S3 C). The objective of our study was primarily to establish a comprehensive contact tracing modeling framework that can be adapted to a wide variety of models. Therefore, we did not present results for different parametrizations of the disease dynamics, which are expected to vary regionally and over time, but chose to focus on one set of values reasonable for COVID-19. While we have explored only constant control parameters u s , u a , and u n , we emphasise that the framework allows them to vary in time. Our results do not qualitatively depend on the precise shapes of ρ c (e) and p i (e) (see SI Appendix Section S3 E). Nevertheless, to adapt the framework to a specific locale, it is important to determine these distributions from real-world data: the exposure distribution may be obtained directly from contact tracing platforms, and the infection probability can be deduced from the contact data in combination with further virological and epidemiological studies. We have shown that our formulation of digital contact tracing, based on the contact exposure distribution ρ c (e) and corresponding relative infection probabilities p i (e), exposes a non-trivial notification threshold for optimal contact notification. Investigating this optimum reveals how, with more stringent social distancing measures or more adoption of the smartphone application, the contact tracing can be tuned to notify fewer contacts while still preventing an epidemic (Figure 4 right) . Importantly, this leads to an overall reduction in unnecessary quarantining. Threshold adjustment allows policy makers to achieve a balance between disease management on the one hand, and social and economic cost on the other hand. We expect that our framework, within which this trade-off can be efficiently studied, will contribute to the implementation of digital contact tracing as a central tool in the sustainable fight against communicable diseases.

68437,"Our analyses showed that rapid diagnosis and isolation of infections based on COVID-19 disease alone cannot control outbreaks of SARS-CoV-2, but that the addition of tracing and isolation of traced cases could in theory be successful (Figure 2 ).

68485,"The present work investigates, using an approach from Optimal Control theory, what could be optimal interventions for limiting the spread of a disease like the COVID-19 epidemic. We consider first the case where only the lockdown lever is operated, as was done in France when massive testing was still not an option. Then, in the other scenarios, optimization is done on both lockdown and detection capacity. The notion of 'best scenario' depends of course on the choice of cost function that is made. The optimization takes into account the trade-off between lowering the number of deaths and minimizing the economic and social costs. To our knowledge, taking into consideration these diverse aspects into the cost function has not been done much in the recent literature (see e.g. Acemoglu et al. (2020)). Another originality of our work how we dealt with the constraint on the ICU capacity. We see that in the solutions, the lockdown and testing controls are set so that the occupation of ICU remains a high as possible under max (due to the economic and social costs). It is really this constraint that shapes the decisions leading to a curve that is 'flattened' sufficiently to ensure the sustainability of the health system. This is particularly visible in the scenario where max is increased of 50% at the beginning of the epidemic: we see a relaxation of the lockdown that is permitted by the increased flux allowed in ICUs. The best scenarios that we obtain are structured into 4 phases: 1) quick and strong measures to recover the control of the epidemic, 2) relaxation of the epidemic once under control to reach the fluxes imposed by the sustainability of the health care system, 3) the fluxes obtained after the period 2 are kept as long as possible to flatten the curve in order to avoid overwhelming the ICUs, 4) once a herd immunity is reached, the lockdown and testing controls can be lowered. Without being an explicit target in the control problem, the evolution of ℜ is extremely interesting, and consistent with existing epidemiological literature. Again, without monitoring that 21 .

68542,"The focus of our work is on predicting the total number of infections in India due to COVID-19 over a short forecast horizon and also studying the effect of lockdown and increased testing on these total infections. The important observations from the first part of the Results section, when total infections are estimated using IFRs are: From Figures 1 and 2 we see that in the pre-lockdown period, the ratio ( At It ) increased with time t and the undetected cases were at least 30000. However, in the first week of the lockdown, the ratio ( At It ) became almost constant over time. This slowing down effect on the rise in the undetected cases may be assumed to be the immediate effect of lockdown. From second week of the lockdown, the ratio ( At It ) is noted to be decreasing with time. This leads to a further decrease in the number of undetected cases. This further decrease may be attributed to the additional effects of increased testing and active hotspot containment during the lockdown period. Thus, it seems from the data, that lockdown and increase in testing have lowered or slowed down the rate of rise in the number of undetected cases. However, one should note carefully the increasing A t /I t ratios prior to lockdown and consider the possible effect of increasing undetected cases before any relaxations of intervention measures. From the model fit and prediction in second step of the Results section, we note a fall in the increase in undetected cases and a simultaneous increase in detection of infections. At the end of the active lockdown we note that 21940 infections will be detected while the undetected cases will vary between 1.75-3.13 lakhs, given the two IFR values. Thus, it seems lockdown and increased testing have been effective measures in reducing the rise in infections from COVID-19 in India. However, as a word of caution, we would like to add that though the rate of increase of undetected cases seems to have slowed down with the interventions, at the end of 3 weeks into lockdown we already have 1.97 -3.36 lakhs existing infections to combat. We would also like to point out that the linear fit to the model coefficients (β t and γ t ) are valid only in the short term, and the proposed infection model should not be used for long term predictions. We understand that ignoring the susceptible population dynamics, limits the proposed model to only predict an exponential increase in the rise of infections. However, we believe that this is a reasonable assumption in the short to medium term when the susceptible population remains very high and the recovered population is negligible. As reported above, we see slight dampening in the exponentially increasing infection figures over differing time periods (during and upto the end of the formal lockdown period). We believe that this decrease in the 10 . CC-BY 4.0    ()  .  /2020 infection rate is due to intervention measures and gradual buildup of awareness in the general population rather than development of herd immunity or recovery dynamics. As an extension of this work, we plan to use our model for predicting state-wise total infections. "
68573,"We concluded that a high fatality among elderly population and its association with co-morbidities gives us a chance to taper our intervention. Standard Operating Procedures for quarantine and isolation of elderly should be revised. Keeping our traditions and cultural norms regarding respect and care of elderly, home quarantine measures should be robust in big cities like Karachi. Male population is more prone linking their social activities in a male dominant society. Analysis of first 100 COVID-19 related deaths is a cue to assess the outcome of measures taken so far. All provinces should take all necessary measures to protect their vulnerable population to lower the CFR further down. "
68574,"As in other countries that adopted isolation measures, the spread of COVID-19 in BR had a slow start. Despite that, after about two months since the first confirmed case, on May 20, 2020 BR reaches second place among the countries that present more confirmed cases of the disease, only behind the United States of America [3] . The results shown in this work point to the necessity to quantify the effectiveness of social distancing interventions for the control of the disease in BR, specifically in its most affected localities. Besides, it is essential to take rapid responses to the emergence of new cases and their impact on the public health system. The Brazilian continental 5 . CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0    ()  .   dimension and great social and demographic differences are factors that hinder the elaboration of public policies for the disease control. The present paper aims to contribute to the development of a model framework to investigate the expansion of COVID-19 in Brazilian locations and the impacts of different measures of social distancing. We apply the developed approach to model the COVID-19 dynamics in BR and RJ. This high populated Brazilian state was one of the first states to adopt mitigation actions, such as the suspension of classes, cancellation of events, and home isolation [13] . According to the current data released by the Brazilian Ministry of Health, RJ is one of the most affected states, both in the number of registered cases of COVID-19 and in the number of deaths. For this reason, the present study analyzes the spread in this state, as well as in the country as a whole, in order to assess the particular characteristics of the pandemic at those different spatial scales. Extensive research for the spread of COVID-19 in BR with multiple perspectives has been reported, e.g., [7, 13, 8] . The present work takes into account factors that are predominant in the Brazilian reality, such as the current limited testing capacity and the policy to test only severely ill hospitalized individuals. We hope that the present investigation brings some insights or guidelines for public health and policy-makers. Due to data paucity, parameter identifiability is a major difficulty. To overcome this issue, only four model parameters were calibrated using a Bayesian approach. Other parameters, as well as model ICs, were set based on available information on COVID-19 (SI -Table A. 3). Our simulation forecasts that the peak of active cases occurs on May 24, 2020 (95% CI: 21-26) and May 28, 2020 (95% CI: 24-2) for BR and RJ, respectively. This difference can be explained due to the discrepancy of the spatial scale, and the way the disease has spread along the different Brazilian locations, considering, for instance, the different political measures taken and the social and demographic structure of each state. The social measures implemented in RJ at the beginning of the pandemic seemed to be able to flatten the epidemic curve and postpone the peak of active cases [13] . Aiming to evaluate the influence of uncertainties in hard-to-track populations such as undiagnosed infected individuals (I and A), as well those who carry the disease and are unable to transmit (E), we performed a sensitivity analysis to understand which model factors (parameters and ICs) play important roles at the various stages of the epidemic for both BR and RJ. The analysis confirms that a proper understanding of how the disease spreads can provide insights and aids to elaborate containment decisions in order to reduce R(t). In this sense, considering both BR and RJ, sensitivity analysis suggests that the most influential parameter for a long term perspective is the quarantine removal rate parameter (ω). We have shown that the rate at which S, E, I and A individuals are removed due to quarantine measures significantly affects R(t), C and D. Such average values under the actual social distancing policy are an idealization since actual values are dynamic and spatially heterogeneous, as mentioned in the last paragraph. In order to study the qualitative effects of changes in social distancing policies, we propose to model ω as an exponential decay function, which can represent different social distancing relaxation scenarios. When more abrupt social distancing relaxation is implemented after the occurrence of the peak of active cases, it accompanies a longer extension of the duration of the disease, with approximately 19% increase in the projected numbers of C and D. If implemented before the peak, the consequences can be devastating, as indicated by our results. The hypothetical scenario built by considering a slow and gradual release implemented 20 days before the original peak indicates a delay of 14 days in the occurrence of the peak of active cases, with more than 890 thousand C and about 85 thousand D accumulated over less than nine months of the presence of the disease in BR. Our simulations highlight the importance of relaxing social distancing measures only under a very careful follow-up. We note that the analysis performed in this paper should be viewed from a qualitative perspective. The conclusions for the considered hypothetical scenarios (with and without distancing relaxation) are based on model predictions and current employed policies. Model simplifications and the calibration procedure of model parameters can explain potential quantitative discrepancies between our predictions and data. Such simplifications include: (i) homogenization of age, social, and spatial structure, (ii) some model parameters are fixed, with values obtained from the literature, and (iii) model parameters are constant along time (except ω, that in some simulations varied in time). Moreover, data have limited information due to sub-notification, since only hospitalized cases are tested in BR. These simplifications are inherent of the modeling procedure, and should be viewed as part of the scientific process of the understanding of the natural phenomena. The present paper can be extended in forthcoming studies, for example, by considering models with spatial heterogeneity, parameter dependence in time and space, and also analysing data considering sub-notification. Data considering other BR states could also be analyzed employing the same procedure adopted in the present paper. Another possible extension could be related to the determination of limit thresholds in the number of P cases under different relaxation social distancing measures. It is important to highlight the impacts of social distancing relaxation in order to control the epidemic. Adoption of this type of measure directly affects the evolution of R(t), as shown in our results. For both BR and RJ, it implies a much slower stagnation or decrease in R(t) from the time the measures are implemented. Since R(t) is in a controlled situation for both scenarios, i.e. R(t) < 1, a direct consequence is that the disease would need more time to be eradicated. Our analyses suggest that policies based on short-term social distancing are not enough to control 7 . CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0    "
68589,"A simplified model applied to COVID-19 cases detected and officially published by the italian government, seems to fit quite well the time evolution of the disease in Italy during the period feb-24th - may-19th 2020. The hypothesis behind the model is based on the fact that in the lockdown period the infection cannot be transmitted due to social isolation and, more generally, due to the strong protection measures in place during the observation period. In this case a compartment model is used and the interactions between the different compartments are simplified. The sample of cases detected is intended as a set of individuals susceptible to infection which, after being exposed and undergoing the infection, were isolated ('treated') in such a way they can no longer spread the infection. The values obtained are to be considered indicative as they depend not only on the quality of the data collected, but also on the qualitative approximation of the curves modeled to the data and on the number of available data. The same model has been applied both to the data relating to Italy and to some regions of Italy (Lombardia, Piemonte, Lazio, Campania, Calabria, Sicilia, Sardegna), generally finding a good response and indicatively interesting values."
68644,"In this final section, after studying the Covid-19 outbreak, we begin by listing the steps we suggest to be followed: Step 1) The weekly spreading rate of the DCCpM (DDpM) as the countries reached the same number of TCCpM (TDpM) can be used to compare countries which are in a different stage of the outbreak, what we called α (β) factor; Step 2) Before reaching the peak, the dynamical (oscillatory) curve of the parameters to be fitted can be used to understand when such a curve crosses the critical line and tends to stabilise; Step 3) After reaching stabilisation, asymmetrical distributions have to be introduced to model the DCCpM and DDpM curves (we used the skew-normal ones). Remembering that herd immunity and low mortality are both fundamental keys in tackling the outbreak, we introduce a factor that could be used to easily compare countries. Observing that if two countries have the same number of TCCpM, the one with an higher number of TpC should have a lower number of infected people in its population with respect to the other, we introduce the following factor As shown in section II, the timely massive testing strategy of the German authorities make the great difference between Germany and Italy. Indeed, mitigation measures (such as physical distancing, contact tracing, restricting public gatherings, closing schools, and university) surely become more effective when a country adopts a timely and massive testing strategy, avoiding that asymptomatic people contribute to transmission and helping sick people to be treated in time before the disease gets worse. The quantitative impact of a massive testing strategy has been studied in [29] . Clearly, if a country has not enough tests, a random smart-testing strategy is required. By testing a much smaller number of randomly selected people per day, it is possible to obtain information on the local spreading rate [30] . Let us now calculate the ρ factor for some countries worldwide that have adopted a smart testing strategy and reduced the number of deaths per million of inhabitants. At the end of May [2] , we find It is important to recall that the ρ factor considers not only the mortality rate but also the immunization rate. It is clear that with an indiscriminate and strict lockdown, one will avoid deaths, but at the same time one will have a very low immunization when facing the second wave of pandemic. The previous table is also useful to understand why the factor TpC is important. Considering South Africa and South Korea, we immediately see that they have practically the same mortality rate: 12/552 and 5/224, respectively. But the testing strategy of South Korea led to a number of tests 4 times the one of South Africa. Consequently, the number of infected people in South Africa is expected to be greater that one of South Korea by probably the same factor. This explains the final ratio of the ρ factor between South Africa and South Korea. In the case of Italy, where a full national lockdown was applied on the beginning of March, we find for its regions the following numbers . CC-BY 4.0    "
68664,"In this work we propose a mathematical approach to investigate the eects on the COVID19 epidemic of social behavioral changes in response to lockdowns. Starting from a SEIRlike model, we assumed that the transmission and quarantine rates are partially determined on voluntary basis and depend on the circulating information and rumors about the disease, modeled by a suitable timedependent information index. We focused on the case of COVID19 epidemic in Italy and explicitly incorporated the progressively stricter restrictions enacted by Italian government, by considering two step reductions in contact rate (the partial and full lockdowns). The main results are the followings: • we estimated two fundamental informationrelated parameters: the information coverage regarding 16 . CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0    Tables 1, 2, 3. the daily number of quarantined and hospitalized individuals (i.e. the parameter k) and the information delay (the quantity a −1 ). The estimate is performed by tting the model's solution with ocial data. We found k = 0.8, which means that the public was aware of 80% of real data and a −1 = 3 days, the time lag necessary to information to reach the public; • social behavioral changes in response to lockdowns played a decisive role in curbing the epidemic curve: the combined action of voluntary compliance with social distance and quarantine resulted in preventing a duplication of deaths and about 46% more contagions (i.e. approximately 360,000 more infections and 35,000 more deaths compared with the total unresponsive case, as of May 18, 2020); • even under circumstances of low information coverage and high information delay (k = 0.2, a = 1/60 days −1 ), there would have been a benecial impact of social behavioral response on disease containment: as of May 18, cumulative incidence would be reduced of 6% and deaths of 11% about. Shaping the complex interaction between circulating information, human behavior and epidemic disease is challenging. In this manuscript we give a contribution in this direction. We provide an application of the information index to a specic eldcase, the COVID19 epidemic in Italy, where the information dependent model is parametrized and the solutions compared with ocial data. Our study presents limitations that leave the possibility of future developments. In particular: (i) the model captures the epidemics at a country level but it does not account for regional or local dierences and for internal human mobility (the latter having been crucial in Italy at early stage of COVID19 epidemic); (ii) the model does not explicitly account of ICU admissions. The limited number of ICU beds constituted a main issue during the COVID19 pandemics [22] . This study did not focus on this aspect 17 . CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0    "

68754,"Using travel flow data extracted from mobile phone trajectories, we documented a large drop in both short-range and long-range population mobility following lockdown enforcement in France. Overall, trips were reduced by 65%, similarly to reductions found in Belgium 8 , Spain 14 , and Italy 11 during lockdown, albeit different data sources, spatial resolutions, and definitions of mobility proxies prevent direct numerical comparisons. The transition signaling the drop in mobility lasted almost a week, anticipating the enforcement of lockdown and creating opposite mobility behaviors. Individuals started spontaneously reducing their mobility on Saturday following the announcement of school closure, likely because of fear of the growing epidemic and heightened risk awareness 36-40 generated by the first governmental decision on nationwide interventions. The weekday-to-weekend pattern was disrupted, with overall mobility on Monday following the closure of all non-essential activities similar to the preceding Saturday. At the same time, fear of an imminent change in policy imposing stricter restrictions -as already implemented in Italy, Spain, Austria 41 pushed individuals to relocate themselves even to farther away regions where to spend the period of lockdown, if put in place. The exodus, largely covered by the press 33,34 , occurred already before the announcement of lockdown and led to anomalous increases in mobility flows out of certain regions (e.g. Île-de-France) and incoming in others (e.g. Normandy). Such behavior was similarly reported in China (from Wuhan to other regions), in Italy (from the North to the South) prior to the implementation of lockdown, and in India 10 . It demonstrates that the timing at which a policy is announced might disrupt social dynamics as much as the direct effect of the policy, at least in the short term. Increased caution should therefore be considered in the period from announcements to enforcement to avoid unpredictable behaviors that may result in unwanted seeding of the epidemic to other areas. No increase in viral circulation became then visible in the receiving regions in the following weeks, as lockdown strongly suppressed epidemic activity in all regions 3, 4, 42, 43 . Seeding events due to relocations may however become more important in phasing out the lockdown, as less strict social distancing measures may prevent such suppression. Region-specific interventions may increase this risk by inducing similar behavioral responses. New York State reported for instance increased mobility in counties with no imposed lockdown 19 . In this perspective, nationwide interventions and restrictions limiting displacements were adopted by several countries 44, 45 to prevent compensation effects and reduce the possible geographical spread of the epidemic. Once lockdown entered into effect, population mobility reductions were heterogeneous across regions. Larger reductions were measured in regions more severely hit by the epidemic, with an estimated 1% decrease in regional mobility every 10 additional hospitalizations (per 100,000 inhabitants). This suggests that individuals witnessing a larger COVID-19 burden on the hospital system in their region may have further limited displacements compared to those living in less affected regions. Media largely communicated on the epidemic, also providing early on region-specific information on hospitalizations and mounting pressure on the healthcare system. Exposure to this information likely triggered a behavioral response increasing compliance to movement restrictions. A similar, though stronger, behavior was observed during a 3-day national lockdown enforced nationwide in Sierra Leone in March 2015 in an effort to control Ebola epidemic 6 . The correlation remains significant even taking out the region of Île-de-France, which experienced a reduction in population due to relocation of individuals. . CC-BY-ND 4.0    "
68764,"Overall, this paper's results highlight the importance of interconnections to understand not only the spread of the virus, but also adaptation and gradual learning in importing ideas and behavior from other countries. Risk perceptions and the willingness to engage in social distancing by the populations of most countries significantly respond to the corresponding variables in socially-connected countries. We stress the role of existing social networks across borders in the transmission of health shocks, perceptions about the risk of the disease, and ideas regarding the merit of social distancing. The results reveal heterogeneous responses across countries to their own domestic coronavirus shocks. A common feature in all responses is that individuals responded with a lag and only gradually reduced their social mobility. This observation is consistent with epidemiological models that include adaptive human behavior and stress the role of informing and motivating people to reduce personto-person contacts, such as the model presented in Fenichel et al. (2011) . Institutional differences among the countries' labor markets are likely responsible for substantially different increases in unemployment. The lower degree of employee protections in the U.S. and the large share of temporary workers in the Spanish economy, are likely to account for the far worse outcomes in these countries. Everywhere else, fluctuations in unemployment have remained much tamer. We estimated a global model of 41 countries to examine the interconnections in coronavirus cases and social and economic responses over the first months of the COVID-19 pandemic. The results suggest that social connections across borders are helpful in understanding the spread of the disease, but also the spread in perceptions and social behavior, among countries. The outbreak led to risk perceptions about Coronavirus that differed internationally. The heterogeneous risk perceptions likely affected the countries' social distancing responses. Populations in most countries, through their social networks, learned from experiences abroad and started to pay more attention to the evolving coronavirus situation and reduced their mobility. They displayed, however, a degree of behavioral adaption: they didn't change their habits immediately, but only gradually over time. Some countries were outliers: they didn't respond much through social distancing, to global or domestic shocks. As a result, they don't show the same reduction in the growth rate of COVID-19 cases in response to social distancing that exists in other countries. The original health shocks, either directly, or through increased uncertainty and social distancing, have economic effects. We focus, in particular, on the response of unemployment. While we do not have data at high frequency on the realized variable, we exploit daily data on an indicator that has been shown to predict actual unemployment quite accurately: unemployment from Google searches. The response of unemployment across countries is very heterogeneous. In the US, unemployment skyrockets. This is consistent with the response of initial unemployment claims in the country. The same happens in Spain, with a large increase of unemployment in response to health shocks. In other countries with less precarious labor markets, the responses are more muted. While their economies are still likely to face a deep recession, fears of unemployment remain lower.   ()   [27] Pesaran, M. H. and Y. Shin (1998).

68791,"In this section, we provide results regarding the short-term analysis with the Kalman filter. From the long-term perspective, we first present results based on GEMF stochastic simulations and then compare the results based on non-Markovian processes and Markov processes. In this work, the ensemble Kalman filter is used to make short-term predictions of the COVID-19 cases in Wuhan City, which resulted in accurate forecasts of daily case reports. The model is able to predict daily cases and the epidemic peak. Knowing the daily cases from forecasts three days in advance allows for the proper resource allocation. The ensemble Kalman filter also allows parameter estimation, which is extremely useful for modeling purposes. From an epidemiological modeling perspective, we simulate the epidemic spreading in Wuhan city based on non-Markovian processes, and show that different distributions with the same mean infectious period can lead to inconsistency in terms of epidemic dynamics. Since most current network-based approaches are based on Markov processes, in which epidemiological parameters are assumed to follow exponential distributions, non-Markovian process-based models need to be further explored to better predict the COVID-19 spreading. Our results show that reducing the infectious period via measures such as early case identification and isolation can reduce the epidemic size significantly. In the long-term perspective, we test and confirm the effectiveness of non-pharmaceutical interventions on the containment of the epidemic dynamics by performing GEMF stochastic simulations. The daily cases . CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0    ()  .  of the COVID-19 epidemic in Hubei Province peaked at over 15,000 on February 12 th and became almost zero in mid-March (Xinhua, 2020) . Our simulation results indicate that the containment of this highly contagious disease was achieved by stringent control measures by the Chinese government. Without continued and aggressive control measures, the epidemic in Hubei Province would have become persistent. If the infection rate is reduced through the enhanced protective measures by 25%, the epidemic would reach the peak in mid-February and fade out in late September. Reducing the average node degree inside each city via social distancing measures, the number of infectious cases would peak at mid-February and decrease to zero at mid-June. Only with combined implementation of enhanced protective measures and social distancing measures, the epidemic dynamics would peak at around mid-February and approximate the actual epidemic trajectory in March. This can be an important message for countries going through the exponential growth of the epidemic in the current days. "
68796,"After an initial period of inactivity, many governments have now moved to impose international travel restrictions to prevent any further importation of COVID-19 cases. However, given that the virus is now a global pandemic and has reached most countries it is reasonable to question the impact of ongoing travel restrictions. In this short communication we have used international flight data and models of disease transmission to predict the national epidemic trajectory had travel bans not been put in place. Our results show that the travel ban on individuals arriving from China successfully delayed the onset of widespread transmission in Australia by four weeks. We also showed that travel bans from Hubei Province alone would have been much less effective, as the virus had already spread to many other provinces by the time the bans were enforced. Similarly, until now travel bans for South Korea and Iran (imposed on February 9 and March 5 respectively) were also shown to have negligible impact. However, as the number of cases in these countries continues to rise we expect these restrictions to become increasingly effective. Universal international travel bans coming into force now appear to be the only rational response, however, we need to consider how long they can and should last. Future travel restrictions may have an impact for the next few weeks but potential importations will eventually be overwhelmed by local transmission, unless we can completely control transmission by achieving a reproduction number below 1. We estimate local transmission will outweigh imports sometime in the next two weeks if transmission proceeds at the pace it did in China prior to Jan 21 (R0 = 2.63), but will be delayed if Australia can successfully reduce transmission to a level similar to China from Jan 21 (R0 = 1.73). is the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in () preprint is the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in () preprint 3 Transmission rates for 2 , 1 , 2 classes 0.3125, 0.5, 0.176 ( (7)) 1 First stage incubation rate 0.3125 ( (7)) 2 Second stage incubation rate 0.5 ( (7)) 1 First stage of recovery 0.5 ( (7)) is the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in () preprint where superscript indicates country.

68836,"Table1 enlists the reproduction number R0 obtained for different values of E f showing that if lockdown is not implemented strictly, the reproduction number will get increased creating large burden on the healthcare system of the country. From Figure 7 , it is evident that the curve shifts to left with increase in E f , which means that when restrictions are waived off, the number of infections will be high and growth rate will also be very high. If current restrictions are continued i.e. E f = 1, then total number of active infections will start to decrease after 22 May 2020. These results are in accordance with the study by DDI lab, Singapore university of technology and design [8] . In addition, this study also models the effect of any waivers on social restrictions with E f > 1, the total number of Figure 11 . Daily new cases/day predicted by SIR model infections are expected to increase before reaching its peak. From Figure 7 and 8, with waiver in restrictions, the number of new infections will be much higher than the recovery. Figure 9 shows that with help of restrictions we can control the number of infections as well as the rate at which are approaching the peak of curve. From Figure 10 , it is evident that only China and South Korea have reached the inflection point which means that infections are yet to reach it's peak in India. The model tells us that to scale back the impact of the disease we would like to lower the 'contact ratio' the maximum amount as possible -which is strictly what the present social distancing measures are designed to try to do. Figure 11 , for E f =1, it shows that the count of daily new cases per day will decrease to 97% of its peak on 16 July 2020 and 99% on 8 August 2020. Only China and South Korea are able to reach their inflection points as of now. We found that if current restrictions like lockdown in India continues with same control till 22 May 2020 then, the number of active infected patients will achieve its peak and start decreasing after this date. To model the impact of travel restrictions like lockdown, social distancing on the reproduction number; we used a parameter E f whose value is used to simulate the effectiveness of social restrictions. With more travel restriction like lockdown the value of E f decreases and hence, effective contact rate decreases which results in reduced R0 [9] . Reproduction number is the average number of non-infected people who got infected by a infected patient. By practising social 5   ()   . distancing and lockdown the value of E f decreases. Any waiver in the current restriction will result in higher reproduction number R0 as well as increase in number of infections in very short time. In addition to lockdown, rapid testing strategies are required [10] for the faster infection detection and thus helping in lifting up lockdown and revival of economy. "
68855,"Figures 3, 4 and 5 illustrate the comparison of actual data and estimated infected population for different contact rates in Colombo, Kalutara and Gampaha districts respectively. There is a discrepancy between the actual data and simulation results in Figure 3 , 4 and 5. Considering the less chances of getting admitted to a hospital and the possibility of having unidentified cases in the country cannot be ruled out in this context. We believe the actual number of infectious persons is not exactly same as the number of reported cases on that day. As stated in the previous section we used .

The computational results over several contact rate values suggest that reduction of contact rate by not less than 50% would make the outbreak easier to control and the results over several quarantine percentage values suggest that tracing not less than 40% of the contact history of infected individual and quarantined them could contribute to reducing the overall size of COVID-19 outbreak. Assuming an ideal situation for self-quarantine, we implemented the simple SEIR model over household data to estimate the approximate time period for the quarantine process and the results indicated the approximate maximum time the household should quarantined is 60 days. In addition, the human mobility inside the country has to be regulated or restricted, in order to stop the disease being transmitted. "

68877,"In this work, we propose to model the behavior of a government as far as the lockdown policy is concerned. The proposed model, despite of its simplicity, has the merit to capture the fundamental tradeoff between economic and health aspects. By modeling the Covid-19 epidemic with a standard SEIR model, we derive the optimal parameters of the 3−phase lockdown policy. The conclusions in terms of optimal policies depend in part on whether economic losses can be considered uniform 8 . CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0    "
68917,"The intention of the present manuscript is to present a model, which permits to trace the Corona virus spread as a function of interventions and to quantify effects on the basis of empirical data and few significant fit parameters. Such models are of great relevance for giving a justification for imposing or releasing measures such as contact ban or lockdown, which have a huge worldwide impact on the economy and daily life. This work is complementary to extended studies using epidemiological models with a large overhead, which are often difficult to apply and to transfers. It has been shown that the approach followed here permits the straightforward comparison of data from different countries. I want to make the following points: . CC-BY 4.0    "
68952,"The United States has become an epicenter for the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. However, communities have been unequally affected and evidence is growing that social determinants of health may be exacerbating the pandemic. Furthermore, the impact and timing of social distancing at the community level have yet to be fully explored. We investigated the relative associations between COVID-19 mortality and social distancing, sociodemographic makeup, economic vulnerabilities, and comorbidities in 24 counties surrounding 7 major metropolitan areas in the US using a flexible and robust time series modeling approach. We found that counties with poorer health and less wealth were associated with higher daily mortality rates compared to counties with fewer economic vulnerabilities and fewer pre-existing health conditions. Declines in mobility were associated with up to 15% lower mortality rates relative to pre-social distancing levels of mobility, but effects were lagged between 25-30 days. While we cannot estimate causal impact, this study provides insight into the association of social distancing on community mortality while accounting for key community factors. For full transparency and reproducibility, we provide all data and code used in this study."
68963,"The aim of this study was to investigate the method used by the ICCRT in [4] for estimation of NPI effects on SARS-CoV-2 spread. We found the combination of high model sensitivity, and the assumption of Rt being driven solely by the NPIs, to constitute a fundamental limitation. This should be considered when the modelling results are used as a basis for policymaking. The perhaps most remarkable result in [4] is that almost all the decrease of viral reproduction was attributed to the lockdown intervention in the 10 countries where it was effectuated. In those same 10 countries, the effects of the 5 other considered intervention categories were almost negligible. In the one country where lockdown was not effectuated (Sweden), it was instead the public events ban intervention that almost alone contributed to attaining Rt<1. It seems unlikely that this would be the result of fortunate circumstances, where lockdown was . CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0    "
68973,"Real-time COVID-19 data analytics have been mainly focused on visualizing the spread [19] 40 with limited effort in developing models to dynamically analyze the data. Epidemiological models, i.e., SIR/SIER models, have a strong foundation in analyzing epidemic growth/decline, and have been substantially explored for modelling the speed of infectious disease progression. Yet, such models are often offline/static, require assumptions for the parametric formulation of the model and rely on multitude of initial parameters. 45   ()   .  We developed a time-series based statistical model to dynamically predict the future trend of COVD-19 spread. It is built upon the strength of SIR/SIER models in considering the speed of progression and coupled with the capacity of time-series models in 1) considering higher orders of derivatives of the number of cases in previous time intervals, 2) accounting for the impact of residuals of the previous time intervals, and 3) incorporating intervention effect as external 5 variables. We presented an automated modelling platform that delves into multiple layers of information in the COVID-19 time series data to find the best fit with the aim of providing robust forecasts. The platform-unlike numerous counterparts that are primarily limited to disseminating the existing patterns-measures the average impact of previous interventions to reduce the growth of the infected cases. This measure is then used for predicting the future 10 spread when similar interventions are considered to further control the outbreak. The presented platform was shown to be effective in estimating the trend of outbreak for each country. We elaborated the importance of data transformation as a preprocessing step and shown that there is no transformation operation which consistently provides the best fit to the data. 15 Hence, exploring multiple options are recommended to stabilize variations prior to modelling using conventional econometrics formulations. A unique aspect of the presented platform is that it facilitates real-time model development incorporating latest reported data into modelling. We have shown that such adaptive model estimation significantly improves the prediction power and therefor, forecasting reliability. 20 One major challenge ahead of governments and policymakers, is the uncertainty around the effectiveness of containment policies in controlling the outbreak. Yet, authorities can observe the effectiveness of what they have done in the past few days, weeks, and months and learn from the impact of their previous decisions to enhance their intelligence in proposing new mechanisms to 25 control the outbreak. We have shown that examining the effect of controlling policies can inform policymakers on number and types of controlling policies required to achieve their objective in reducing the number of infected cases. We have shown for Australia, as a case study, that containment policies not only decline the number of infected cases right after implementation, but also reduce the slope of progression. The latter is a more outstanding factor, especially when 30 such policies are coupled with economic related policies given the recession or depression that is expected to happen during or after the COVID-19 pandemic. Overall, given the unknown nature of SARS-CoV-2 spread, we need to relax the boundaries of potential methods, beyond classical epidemic models, to further explore the behavior of data to account for unknown aspects the virus spread.

69014,"In conclusion, the hybrid model developed combining exponential and polynomial functions showed promising results to predict the trends of the COVID-19 epidemic. Further, additional simulations incorporating control measures clearly showed that deviations in the levels of compliance could trigger a higher number of active cases and bring upon the exponential features of the epidemic. At this stage our evidence indicates that early relaxation of the control measures that are in place is not advisable. "

69152,"The World Health Organization (WHO), on March 11, 2020, declared COVID-19 a pandemic caused with the infection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), a virus that first emerged in the Wuhan city of Hubei province, China, and rapidly spread in every country in the world [11] . As of April 9, 2020, more than 2.3 million COVID- 19 . CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0    ()  . In the present study, the dynamic changes of the epidemiologic parameters were taken into account at three different geographical locations: India, China, and countries outside China. The prevailing epidemic scenario in India was compared with the situation worldwide in countries outside China, and China only as depicted in Figure 1 , Figure 2 and Figure 3 respectively, in each figure (a) to (d) representing variation in daily growth rate (DGR) with infected case numbers, observed case numbers with predicted numbers, case recovery rate (CRR) with case fatality rate (CFR), and SI with R, respectively. Since the first detection of COVID- 19 An undulating pattern of DGR of COVID-19 infected cases was observed for India as well as world excluding China, but with gradual decrease in the latter for the last few days, while in China the DGR was <0.3 % since February 23, 2020 onwards, as found in the present study. Sanche et al. [12] estimated the growth rate of the early outbreak of COVID-19, in China, as 0.21-0.30 per day. The CFR, which was defined as the ratio of deaths from COVID-19 to the number of cases, provides an assessment of virulence/clinical severity. Therefore, in order to explore the early insights into the severity of ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, CFR of the disease was also estimated. Yang et al. [13] , using data-driven statistical method, estimated CFR in the early phase of COVID-19 as 0.15% in mainland China without Hubei, 1.41% in Hubei province without Wuhan city, and 5.25% in Wuhan. The COVID-19 CFR in China has been reported to be as high as 15%, due to low initial case number, which on later time decreased to 3·4% [14] . As of March 17, 2020, in Italy, the CFR of COVID-19 has been recorded as 7.2%, which stands higher than the CFR (2.3%) in China, as of February 11, 2020 [15] ; interesting to note, Italy had CFR of 2.3% (as of February 28, 2020), which was identical to the CFR of China [16] . Therefore, though the transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 is high, the CFR of COVID-19 seems to be lesser compared to that of the other human coronaviruses: SARS (9·5%) and MERS (34·4%), but higher than that of influenza (0·1%) [14] . The CFR in India and the world excluding China showed a rising trend CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0    ()  . representing the time from illness onset in a primary case to illness onset in a secondary case is imperative to recognize the turnover of case generations and COVID-19 transmissibility [17] . Sanche et al. [12] determined the doubling time of COVID-19 at early outbreak, in China, as 2.3 -3.3 days, reflecting the high transmission rate of the virus, SARS-CoV-2. The distribution of COVID-19 SI is a critical input for determining R0 and the extent of interventions required to control an epidemic [18] . The mean SI for COVID-19 estimated as of February 8, 2020, by Du et al. [19] was 3.96 days, which was shorter than that found in the current study, and as calculated for SARS (8.4 days) [20] , or MERS (14.6 days) [21] as well, implying that contact tracing strategies must contend with the fast replacement of case generations, resulting into number of contacts surpass the existing healthcare facilities [22] . The mean incubation period (time from exposure to symptoms development) for COVID-19 is approximately 5 days (range 1-14 days) [23] . A longer SI than the incubation period is indicative of symptomatic COVID-19 transmission [22] , as has been observed for India and world excluding China [ Figure Table 1 represents the R0, R, and Re values estimated from data based on DGR, exponential and SIR mathematical models for three locations.

69165,"Both scenarios involve strong mitigations, certainly stronger than current measures already implemented. Both mitigations end the epidemic eventually, around August. But one causes along the way a catastrophic event for the healthcare system, with many potential deaths predicted, and one does not. We note that in both Wuhan and Italy, strong mitigation measures were taken such as lockdown, but they were taken too late and still resulted in thousands of lives lost, including those of healthcare professionals. As the epidemic develops along its inevitable exponential growth trajectory, it is equally inevitable that leadership will eventually be forced to implement lockdown. Thus, if this is going to happen anyway, it should be taken as early as possible. Our calculation shows that the just-in-time scenario accomplishes this and that the window for such a strong mitigation will soon be closed. Of course, one cannot be sure that the dates and course of the epidemic are going to follow the precise predictions we have made. There are inevitable uncertainties in making predictions for such a powerful phenomenon as an epidemic. However, whether the outcomes predicted by our scenarios occur on exactly the dates given here, and with exactly the numbers provided here, they will occur as we have predicted. The window that we have predicted is rather short, perhaps two weeks at the longest. Thus to be safe, the mitigation measures should be implemented as soon as possible, while they will be effective; at the same time, for humanitarian reasons, the societal implications of lockdown require appropriate arrangements to be made for the city's population, as has already done for the mitigation efforts to date. "
69202,"Modeling and analyzing the spread of COVID-19, and assessing the effect of various policies could be instrumental to national and international agencies for health response planning (9, 14, 21, 28, 36, 38) . We show that the effect of interstate travel reduction is at most modest in the United States when the outbreak has already widespread in all states. On the other hand, we need to impose strong transmission-reduction intervention and increased testing capacity and report rate to contain the spread of virus. The result is in agreement with previous findings (9, 12, 14, 23, 36, 40) , suggesting that the effect of travel ban at a later stage of the outbreak is rather modest. This is also in line with the fact that the outbreaks still occurred in Europe even upon the strong travel ban on the earlier epicenter of Wuhan and its surrounding cities in China. We also show that the transmission-reduction intervention such as policies on the social-distancing and shelter-in-place rules, and the increase of testing rate, which facilitates immediate isolation upon exposure, will significantly reduce the total infected population. Such effect is mostly visible for the states of NY, NJ, MI, and IL. Particularly, our modeling results showed that for states such as NY and MI, to achieve an optimal infection reduction, a more proactive approach needs to be taken to quickly identify the exposed population and isolate them within two days of exposure in order to ensure the infection reduction. The result is in agreement with previous findings (24, 28) . We do need to emphasize that the model itself does not distinguish different ways of traveling across states. Indeed, if the interstate travel is conducted mostly through transiting through busy airports and train stations, and the social-distancing policy is not strictly imposed, then the high population density at these places will bring up the transmission rate b locally in space and time, leading to a higher infection rate. This is a severe consequence, but it should not be counted as the direct result of relaxing travel restrictions. "
69224,"In this work we proposed time dependent modifications of the SIR compartmental model, referred to as SIR-T, SIRD-T and SIAR-T, as fit models for understanding the evolution of the COVID-19 outbreaks in Italy and other countries (Spain in our case). In particular, those models allow us to infer the most important epidemic parameters fitting simultaneously active and concluded cases in presence of lock-down and social distancing restrictions. The study that we have reported in this paper shows that the SIR model, with the changes proposed above, describes so far satisfactorily the COVID-19 Italian data time dependence with lock-down effects. The same model and assumptions work for other country data, as e.g. for Spain. Yet, in some cases reported, as an example, for the latest Spanish data, South Korean data, and Chinese data [6] some non-statistical effect are evident. These effects can be due to a strong lock-down procedure impact or to a sudden increase of the infection. In these cases the statistical model discussed in this work is not appropriate to account for important discontinuities in the data. However, it is worth mentioning that indeed the effect of the lock-down is evident in the data that we have analysed. As a matter of fact, data show small discontinuities due to the lock-down which are taken care by the model described in this work. Among all candidates, the SIR-T model represents, given its simplicity, the best model fit, being the concluded cases (recovered+deceased) more stable with respect to the separate components, even in presence of an asymptomatic hidden component (especially if in constant ratio with the visible components). This model represents a good candidate for predicting the time evolution of the outbreak, with a sizable time scale, especially after the active case peak is overtaken. The model has satisfactory agreement with data if restrictions play important role in limiting the possible susceptible population inside the virtual box. If restrictions are reasonably respected by people, the model predicts the end of the critical period in less than a few months. Inattention and carelessness by communities and governments will open the virtual box again exposing more people to the infection and creating a new starting point for the new cases evolution. As a consequence, an out-of-control spread of the epidemic can make the final number of cases a sizeable fraction of the total country population, quantified in many tens of millions. In cases of lack of attention to the lock-down the model fails to predict the evolution because of uncontrolled effects. . CC-BY-ND 4.0    ()  .   "
69227,"In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, a large number of countries worldwide have implemented or are planning to implement national-scale control interventions to slow or eliminate transmission of the virus. Our review of the extent to which interventions have successfully reduced Reff, a measure of transmissibility, informs future modelling to predict the outcomes we might expect from interventions employed in Aotearoa New Zealand. Our analysis of case data for COVID-19 in 25 countries/states found that Reff consistently decreased between the early and late phases of exponential growth in all locations considered. Lasting immunity is yet to be confirmed for those who recover from COVID-19, therefore a mitigation strategy aimed at allowing controlled spread (i.e. small Reff values greater than 1) does not guarantee herd immunity will develop in the population. There is therefore value in achieving Reff < 1, and our results show that several countries implementing strong interventions have successfully reduced Reff below this outbreak threshold. The time taken to implement high intensity (Alert Levels 3-4) interventions and the stringency with which they were implemented varied considerably between countries, as did the resulting late-phase Reff estimates. However, in general, faster implementation and longer durations of sustained Alert Level 3-4 interventions yielded greatest reductions in Reff. . CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0    "
69246,"The short story of Covid-19 has shown a range of fundamental issues in relation to the available options of epidemic control. Ruling out -unless alternative choices are unavailable -the ""herd immunity"", or ""ng nothing"" solution, initially invoked by the UK Prime Minister, the first of these issue is that border surveillance plus containment at onset are difficult due to the presence of a remarkable number of presymptomatic, asymptomatic and pauci-symptomatic subjects. If such measures fail, and the epidemic spreads, the only strategy to contain its dramatic burden, protecting fragile people and avoiding hospital collapses, is by resorting to extreme measures, namely early and intensive lockdown. The earlier the lockdown is declared, the lower the negative impact on economic. Indeed, the lockdown duration required for adequate epidemic control, will in this case be minimal. These facts are undoubtedly clear from the evidence comparing situations of late lockdown e.g., Lombardy Region, against situations, as regions of Central and Southern Italy (Riccardo et al 2020) , where the national lockdown declaration came for these regions at a sufficiently early stage of the epidemic. However, the Lombardy case showed that, if delayed, even a full lockdown cannot prevent a prolonged mortality bulge due to the collapse of the diagnostic chain and hospitals (Remuzzi and Remuzzi, 2020, Ferguson et al 2020) . In other words: there is a maximal lockdown date. Notably, the time window for lockdown declaration is short due to the fast timescale of Covid-19 growth characterised by a doubling time of 3 days about (Cereda et al 2020 , Guzzetta et al 2020 and to its intrinsic ""delays"", namely: i) the presence of a latency period and ii)the time needed for case-confirmation procedures. These delays imply that cases confirmed today result from infections caught even, say, 12 days ago. In this work, we have used a simple game-theoretic framework to analyse the inertia effects in political decisions that arise due to the strategic interaction between the political actors in such emergency situations, namely the Government, the opposition, and myopic economic lobbies opposing the lockdown due to its presumed economic costs. Our results are as follows. As a rule, the lockdown will always be declared immediately (i.e., without delay) as sustained transmission arises, only if the government feels to be fully responsible towards all citizens. This situation is unlikely to occur as an outcome of the pre-epidemic phase, due to the fact that the political debate (and payoffs) in this phase will still be biased by evaluations typical of ordinary political phases. Second, unless the government does not attribute any cost to the epidemic, the exponential growth of the epidemic will eventually dominate the agents' payoffs, so that -sooner or later -the lockdown declaration will always occur. That is, both the government and the opposition will unavoidably be forced by the epidemic to switch towards a higher degree of ""responsibility towards citizens"" regardless of their initial position. However, this will occur with a delay. There is a further nontrivial situation where the lockdown can be declared with short or no delay, which arises when the political opposition is at least as responsible as the Government since the beginning, or when it becomes such during the epidemic course. This however requires the solution of coordination issue which cannot taken for granted. Finally, the success of the lockdown in containing the epidemic and reducing incidence will unavoidably bring a situation where a payoff re-switch will occur, causing players to return to a situation of lower responsibility. This might cause an untimely unlock of activities, thereby promoting a fast return of above threshold. As a consequence, epidemic restart given that the susceptible proportion in the population likely is still very high. This unless the majority of citizens have 'interiorized' the lockdown lesson and spontaneously maintain for a sufficiently long period a reduction of behaviours at risks of infection. Tis, however, would imply that the behavioural changes of citizens are fully or mildly dependent on the information on the disease prevalence, which is unlikely (Manfredi and d'Onofrio, 2013) . Another possible scenario is that the unlockdown coincides with external factors possibly reducing the disease transmission, e.g. increase of temperature (Buonomo et al, 2018) . To sum up, our main point here is that the presence of a lower initial degree of players' political responsibility, jointly with inappropriate evaluation of epidemic cost and pressure enacted by economic lobbies, can be responsible of substantial delays in the timing of the lockdown declaration. But these delays will add to the objective delays that are intrinsic to Covid-19 transmission (latency times and delays related to cases confirmation process), thereby causing a dramatic amplification of epidemic impact, even in the presence of a full lockdown. Just to exemplify in plain language, suppose science suggests that the lockdown should be declare today based on some epidemic marker. This implies that the first evidence of the lockdown success -in terms of a slowing down of the epidemic curve -will be detectable only after say 12 days, during which -given a 3 days doubling time -a 16-fold increase in cases, hospitalizations and deaths is expected to occur. However, if political inertia causes a further 6-9 days delay -that is 2-3 further doubling times -prior to lockdown, the observed growth would bring a 64-128-fold cases increase-a very large epidemic almost surely overwhelming whatever hospital resources might be available. A further negative impact would be at world-wide scale. Indeed, untimely end of lockdown would be dependent on local dynamics of the disease, thus causing a heterogeneous distribution of the disease dynamics, which potentially could favour the pandemics. More than this, we would like to pinpoint the pernicious role that mild degrees of responsibility of the government and the opposition, combined with lobby pressures can have (and actually had) on the entire war against Covid.-19. Indeed, these factors can delay the lockdown declaration, eventually implying the need of a longer lockdown (due to the much worse epidemic outcome, despite lockdown). But the longer lockdown will unavoidably increase its overall economic impact. And the economic losses will motivate the lobbies and low-responsible political parties -which caused the lockdown delay -to ask for the need to unlock earlier given the economic damage. Thereby accelerating the need for further lockdown and potentially increasing the economic damage they claim they want to mitigate. . CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0    "

69319,"Important insights drawn from the study are summarized by the following points. (1) ng Nothing (DN) and allowing infection to spread in the hope of growing Herd Immunity is clearly not acceptable as it results in far too many infections and death. (2) The study confirms that Lockdown(LD) is an acceptable strategy with and without contact tracing as it reduced the attack rate to 0.52% compared to 85% with no interventions. When used with TC2S it further improves to 0.35%. (3) Lockdowns of limited duration or relaxed Lockdowns are not acceptable even in the early stages. However, Lockdowns of limited duration is extremely useful to bring down the infections temporarily. (4) Releasing the lockdown for a few days in a week(TDWW) can be considered but it can be risky. Contact Tracing should be a must for such policies. (5) TC2S when used as a stand-alone strategy may not be effective but when used with some of the other alternatives it can generate much improved policies. Mild lockdowns, which on its own is not acceptable, but when coupled with TC2S produces an acceptable policy. Another intervention, shortened week with lockdown (TDWW+LD) is risky but when applied with TC2S becomes very effective. When used with TC2S it reduces the attack rate by 1/3 that of Lockdown. The effectiveness of TC2S, as proposed here, would depend on not only identifying the complete list of infected people in the contact network but also would require identifying any infected people in the network of the contacts. These findings are similar to [9, 11] where it is argued that extensive contact tracing and case isolation may help (6) WSO(0,3) appears to be the most promising alternative to LD. It not only outperforms LD on attack rate but also reduces the duration of the epidemic by 1/2 when augmented with contact tracing. Even mild lockdowns with contact tracing in WSO can be an acceptable alternative. 12 .

Any policy with score less than 1 should be preferred over LD. From the chart two distinct policy alternatives emerge which could match the effectiveness of Lockdown when applied as Intervention measures in early stages of the pandemic. In this note we reported an empirical study of various policy alternatives to Lockdown for suppressing COVID19 pandemic on a city modeled by MLSW, a small world model. This type of small world model does not seem to have been investigated before and a detailed mathematical study of the properties should be an important area of investigation. Our results indicate three interesting highlights. Firstly, Tracing the Contacts and their Contacts shows substantial benefits over the usual practice of Tracing the Contacts. Secondly, opening the economy partially, say 2 days a week followed by a Lockdown, could be more effective than Lockdown. Thirdly, and most importantly, the most preferred strategy should be to do hotpot surveillance. It is argued that not only it has lower attack rates, it also is much faster in destroying the virus. On top of these two things it is also economically far more efficient. If this is introduced early enough it is possible that 14 .

69432,"The COVID-19 pandemic has prompted a lockdown in many countries to control the exponential spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. This resulted in curbing the epidemic by reducing the time-varying basic reproduction number (Rt) to below one. Governments are looking for evidence to balance the demand of their citizens to ease some of the restriction, against the fear of a second peak in infections. More details on the specific circumstances that promote exponential spread (i.e. Rt>1) and the measures that contributed most to a reduction in Rt are needed. Here we show that in 33 of 35 Western countries (32 European, plus Israel, USA and Canada), Rt fell to around or below one during lockdown (March - May 2020). One third of the effect happened already on average 6 days before the lockdown, with lockdown itself causing another major drop in transmission. Country-wide compulsory usage of masks was implemented only in Slovakia 10 days into lockdown, and on its own reduced transmission by half. During lockdown, decreased mobility in retail and recreation was an independent predictor of lower Rt during lockdown, while changes in other types of mobility were not. These results are consistent with anecdotal evidence that large recreational gatherings are super-spreading events, and may even suggest that infections during day-to-day contact at work are not sufficient to spark exponential growth. Our data suggest measures that will contribute to avoiding a second peak include a tight control on circumstances that facilitate massive spread such as large gatherings especially indoors, physical distancing, and mask use."
69477,"In this study we have estimated the severity of the COVID 19 outbreak in Pakistan, modelling the transmission dynamics of the disease using an extension of the SEIR model. The model includes important transmission pathways such as asymptomatics, quarantined and isolated individuals as well as the medicated population sub group. We also use this model to project the epidemic curve and give estimates of the disease burden under various realistic control strategies. An ordinary differential equation based model is used for the transmission dynamic of COVID 19 as described above. Disease free equilibrium (DFE) and an en equilibrium when the disease is endemic in the population is derived. We establish a threshold quantity R0 in terms of the parameters of the model, observing that the disease dies out whenever R0 < 1 and is endemic if R0 > 1. We study the variation of R0 on some of the model parameters, specifically on the parameters which can be varied by various control mechanisms, such as quarantine, social distancing and medication. We note that quarantine and social distancing and medication can help in lowering the value of R0 and bring the epidemic under control, with quarantine being the most effective mechanism followed by social distancing and medication. However there are practical difficulties in establishing a strict quarantine as is evident from the relaxation of lock downs in most countries, hence a mix of all these strategies is perhaps the best way forward. Noting that in Pakistan the epidemic progressed in two distinct phases, before and after the lock down restrictions were relaxed, we estimate the value of R0 separately for both these phases. For the pre relaxation phase we estimate R0 = 1.07 and for the post relaxation phase our estimate comes out to be R0 = 1.86. This is consistent with the growth dynamics and other estimates in the literature. These results are then used to project the epidemic curve. We explore various possible scenarios, with varying levels of lock down, social distancing and medication. The lock down and social distancing measures are captured by quarantine rate ( ) and contact rate (β) in our study. In the case where a strict lock down is enforced taking the quarantine rate back to pre-relaxation level, varying the contact and medication rates, we observe that in the best case scenario with high level of all controls the epidemic will peak around late June to early July with a maximum active infected number around 90000. For a moderate lock down which is modelled by taking the quarantine rate to be twice the post-relaxation rate, and varying the contact and medication rates we note that the epidemic will peak around mid July with the active infected numbers around 120000 at that point considering that social distancing measures are enhanced. Finally, we look at the case when no further lock down measures are taken and the quarantine rate remains at the value estimated on June 15, in this scenario we note that the epidemic will peak around late September with the maximum active infected number around 700000. In this work we estimated the severity of the COVID 19 outbreak in Pakistan, noting that the epidemic followed two different trajectories before and after lock down restrictions were relaxed. The restrictions we observe kept the value of R0 close to 1, however once the restrictions were eased the number of cases increased at a high rate, reflected in R0 = 1.86. We also generated possible future trajectories based on intervention and control measures to varying degrees. In case no significant measures are taken at the peak of the epidemic, which will occur in September the maximum active cases will cross the 700000 mark while in a very optimistic scenario this will happen in early July with maximum active cases contained to around 150000. We strongly agree with the recent WHO recommendation that some form of moderate lock down needs to be reinforced, this along with social distancing and possible medication will result in a disease peak sometime in mid July and contain the maximum active infected numbers to around 120000. Inaction at this point of the epidemic is projected to have very serious consequences both in terms of disease burden and mortality. 14 . CC-BY-ND 4.0    "
69515,"Until a vaccine is widely available, social distancing in some form will continue to be one of the only effective approaches for preventing the spread of the coronavirus. Despite its importance, social distancing practice remains sensitive to shifts in announcements, policy enactments, and individual and community-level characteristics. Using mobility data as a proxy for social distancing, we found that social distancing in the US increased significantly throughout March and peaked on the Sunday (April 12) before the US government announced the OUAA guidelines. After the peak, despite continued growth in the total number of new cases, we observed significant declines in social distancing nationallyinitially in the absence of guidance and policies permitting movement, but with additional significant declines following the OUAA announcement and the relaxation of individual state policies restricting movement. Interestingly, we found that shifts in social distancing began prior to specific policy enactments (whether to restrict or to relax movements), suggesting that people may shift behavior in anticipation of policy changes. We also observe that social distancing was much greater on weekends than weekdays throughout March, suggesting weekday activities (presumably employment-related) were still limiting how much people could social distance. By early May this gap disappeared and reversed, with even less social distancing on weekends than weekdays. This suggests a fundamental shift in how much caution individuals were choosing to exercise in their free time. These findings have important implications for the future of the pandemic response. First, social distancing behaviors change over time, regardless of specific policy mandates. The observed decline in social distancing prior to any policies allowing increased movement could be due to individual social distancing fatigue leading to reduced precautions in behavior, or to public discussion of predicted reopening policies triggering preemptive behavior change. During outbreaks, protective behaviors can be influenced by news coverage on the current reported severity (Andersen, 2020; Fenichel, Kuminoff, & Chowell, 2013; Wong & Sam, 2010) or mismatched expectations between individual perception and actual policy mandates (i.e. policies lasted longer than expected) (Briscese, Lacetera, Macis, & Tonin, 2020) . While this analysis cannot show what caused the decline in social distancing, the fact that individuals change their behaviors before policies are enacted suggests the need to keep a close pulse on social distancing behaviors so that policy can appropriately respond to behavioror, more importantly, accurately anticipate it, to enforce social distancing as needed. Research suggests that risk perception and community norms are key predictors of social distancing behavior (Charles et al., 2020) . Mitigating the negative costs of social distancing (e.g., providing monetary compensation for lost income) (Bodas & Peleg, 2020; Wright et al., 2020) or targeting risk communication to those who may feel less impacted (e.g., wealthy individuals) can improve social distancing compliance (Bodas & Peleg, 2020) . Responding to observed changes in behavior requires policy, messaging, and communication that will appeal to these behavioral drivers and consider expectations of social distancing compliance. Second, policy signaling can influence behavior. Although social distancing declined prior to reopening decisions, there remains an observed relationship between national policy announcements and shifts in . CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0    "

Our findings are summarized as follows. First, our empirical analysis indicates that mandating face masks have reduced the spread of Covid-19 without affecting people's social distancing behavior measured by Google Mobility Reports. Our counterfactual experiment based on the estimated model indicates that, if all states had have adopted mandatory face mask policy on April 1st of 2020, then the   ()   .  Second, we find that the impact of all policies combined on case growth is quite large, reducing the growth rate of cases by 60 percent. Except for mandatory face mask policy, the effect of all other policies on case growth is realized through their impact on social distancing behavior.

69612,"In this work, we have introduced a novel epidemiological model of the COVID-19 pandemic which incorporates explicit social distancing via separate compartments for susceptible and asymptomatic (but infectious) individuals. We believe that this is the first model which characterizes social distancing protocols as rates of flow between these compartments, with the rates determined by guidelines implemented by regional governmental intervention. In particular, we view these rates as controls, and one of our primary focuses of study is disease response (measured by peak symptomatic proportion) to different mandated social distancing controls. Our major contributions are described below: 1. In model formulation, we decouple the rate of social distancing (h 2 ) with the decrease in contact due to social distancing ( S , A , I ). The latter we term the contact rescaling factor (CoRF), which should be interpreted as an effectiveness of social distancing. Hence we explicitly account for both the rate at which individuals distance, and how effective distancing is as a means of suppressing viral transmission. 2. The basic reproduction number, R 0 , is explicitly calculated for our model system. For parameters obtained from data, we show that no amount of distancing will result in an R 0 < 1, i.e. that there will always be an initial outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the situation is not hopeless, as social distancing policies are able to push R 0 < 1 as the disease spreads throughout the population. 3. R 0 is very sensitive to the fraction of infective individuals that are asymptomatic, and to the infectivity of these asymptomatic individuals. Hence understanding this population (through, for example, widespread testing) is critical for making informed policy decisions. 4. There is a critical time to implement social distancing guidelines (what we label the critical intervention delay (CID)), after which social distancing will have little effect on mitigating the outbreak. Surprising, the CID occurs well before the peak symptomatic proportion would have originally appeared under non-distanced protocols (CID is approximately 30 days for our parameter values, while non-distanced peak occurs at about 51 days). 5. Periodic relaxation strategies, where normal behavior is allowed for certain periods of time, can significantly reduce the symptomatic burden. However, such scheduling is not robust, and small errors (either in timing, or via parameter estimation) may have catastrophic repercussions. 6. Gradual relaxation can substantially improve the overall symptomatic response, but the rate of relaxation is important to prevent a ""second wave"" of virus outbreak. Prolonged relaxation and relaxation at flattening can significantly ""flatten the curve."" As noted throughout the manuscript, exact predictions rely on estimated parameter values, which currently vary widely throughout the literature. On the other hand, we believe that the qualitative phenomenon observed are robust, and should be considered during policy design. Future work will involve a more systematic control analysis involving both the rate of social distancing (h 2 ) and the stringency of distancing (CoRF, i.e. terms). Ideally, we would like to minimize the peak of the symptomatic population (I) while simultaneously maximizing the time to reach this peak; we view such an objective as a precise quantification of ""flattening the curve."" This must be done with distancing constraints imposed, to reflect the fact that a certain percentage of the population must remain active to maintain a functional society (healthcare workers, food supply, emergency responders, etc.). Using optimal control and feedback laws, our model can help inform policy makers as they make difficult decisions about how to adapt to the ongoing pandemic. "
69623,"The COVID-19 virus has spread worldwide in a matter of a few months, while healthcare systems struggle to monitor and report current cases. Testing results have struggled with the relative capabilities, testing policies and preparedness of each affected country, making their comparison a non-trivial task. Since severe cases, which more likely lead to fatal outcomes, are detected at a higher rate than mild cases, the reported virus mortality is likely inflated in most countries. Lockdowns and changes in human behavior modulate the underlying growth rate of the virus. Under-sampling of infection cases may lead to the under-estimation of total cases, resulting in systematic mortality estimation biases. For healthcare systems worldwide it is important to know the expected number of cases that will need treatment. In this manuscript, we identify a generalizable growth rate decay reflecting behavioral change. We propose a method to correct the reported COVID-19 cases and death numbers by using a benchmark country (South Korea) with near-optimal testing coverage, with considerations on population demographics. We extrapolate expected deaths and hospitalizations with respect to observations in countries that passed the exponential growth curve. By applying our correction, we predict that the number of cases is highly under-reported in most countries and a significant burden on worldwide hospital capacity."
69663,"In this Twitter analysis of social distancing-related tweets during the COVID-19 pandemic, several observations emerged. During the early phases of the COVID-19 pandemic in January and February, outbreaks were confined to China and nearby countries; consequently, tweets during these early months were thought to be confined and in reference to the situations in these countries. . CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0    We conclude that social distancing can be defined in terms of facets which may respond to certain moments and events in a pandemic. Social distancing efforts during the COVID-19 pandemic are unprecedent and measurement of these practices is challenging, but Twitter can be applied to understanding the public's practice of and response to social distancing. The spatiotemporal analysis of multiple facets of social distancing in this study helps evaluate the penetration of information and has the potential to provide insights in evaluating public health measures.

69677,"We have inferred the effective start date of NPIs in several geographical regions using an SEIR epidemiological model and an MCMC parameter estimation framework. We find examples of both late and early effect of NPIs ( Figure 1 ). For example, in Italy and in Wuhan, China, the effective start of the lockdowns seems to have occurred five days or more after the official date ( Figure 2 ). This difference might be explained by low compliance: In Italy, for example, the government intention to lockdown Northern provinces leaked to the public, resulting in people leaving those provinces 9 . Late effect of NPIs may also be due to the time required by both the government and the citizens to organise for a lockdown, and for the new guidelines to be adopted by the population. In contrast, in most investigated countries (e.g., Spain and France), we inferred reduced transmission rates even before official lockdowns were implemented ( Figure 3 ). An early effective date might be due to early adoption of social distancing and similar behavioural adaptations in parts of the population. Adoption of these behaviours may occur via media and social networks, rather than official government recommendations and instructions, and may have been influenced by increased risk perception due to domestic or international COVID-19-related reports. Indeed, the evidence supports a change in infection dynamics (i.e. a model with fixed or free τ) even for Sweden (Table S1, Figure S4a) , where a lockdown was not implemented * . Attempts to asses the effect of NPIs 3,7 generally assume a seven-day delay between the implementation * Sweden banned public events on Mar 12, encouraged social distancing on Mar 16, and closed schools on Mar 18 7 . 6 . CC-BY 4.0    We have inferred the effective start date of NPIs and found that they often differ from the official dates. Our results highlight the complex interaction between personal, regional, and global determinants of behavioral response to an epidemic. Therefore, we emphasize the need to further study variability in compliance and behavior over both time and space. This can be accomplished both by surveying differences in compliance within and between populations 2 , and by incorporating specific behavioral models into epidemiological models 1,5,18 . "
69697,"Since its discovery in the Hubei province of China, the global spread of the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 has resulted in millions of COVID-19 cases and hundreds of thousands of deaths. The spread throughout Asia, Europe, and the Americas has presented one of the greatest infectious disease threats in recent history and has tested the capacity of global health infrastructures. Since no effective vaccine is available, isolation techniques to prevent infection such as home quarantine and social distancing while in public have remained the cornerstone of public health interventions. While government and health officials were charged with implementing stay-at-home strategies, many of which had little guidance as to the consequences of how quickly to begin them. Moreover, as the local epidemic curves have been flattened, the same officials must wrestle with when to ease or cease such restrictions as to not impose economic turmoil. To evaluate the effects of quarantine strategies during the initial epidemic, an agent based modeling framework was created to take into account local spread based on geographic and population data with a corresponding interactive desktop and web-based application. Using the state of Massachusetts in the United States of America, we have illustrated the consequences of implementing quarantines at different time points after the initial seeding of the state with COVID-19 cases. Furthermore, we suggest that this application can be adapted to other states, small countries, or regions within a country to provide decision makers with critical information necessary to best protect human health."
69718,"Our results on the numerical values of the (effective daily) reproduction number R 0 show that a social distancing of 2 contacts per day is not effective to reduce its value below 1.7, even with a test rapidity t I = 1 day to quarantine infected people. Our study suggests that the two parameters have to be activated at the same time. Requesting strict social distancing without reaching a critical value for R 0 in a reasonable number of days risks a failure and the lose of faith in the adopted mea- sures. The most favorable Scenarios (D) and (E) (cfr. lower panel of Fig. 4 ) need from 10 to 15 days before reaching values of R 0 < 1 despite a screening rapidity of 8 hours (from a starting point of 3 days). The inertia of the distribution can force the time interval up to one month before seeing visible effects. The improvement of rapid diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 with automation and large number of sample processing, is essential in order to implement infection prevention measures lowering R 0 significantly. After March 8th, the measures proposed to reduce the social distancing in Italy have been enhanced each week in order to lower the contact rate (already as low as 2 contact per day, as assumed in the scenarios of Section III. The combined effect of the imposed isolation and a strong reduction of screening time can be seen in the lower curve of Fig. 5 (scenario (D) ). The cumulative effect reduces the delay from 10 days to 5 days to reach R 0 ≈ 1 and in a further 5 days R 0 ≈ 0.15, a value drastically low to see, day by day a 30% reduction of new infected people each day. The corresponding parameters are c ≈ 1 contact per day and t I ≈ 10 hours. These results seem to be fully consistent with the Comment by Anderson et al. [12] . The flexibility of the model we are using can allow the introduction of the effects of such further control restrictions. Eq. (9) shows how such a measures have been further implemented reducing the contact rate from c(t = t 0 ) = c 0 = 2 day −1 to c(t t 0 ) ≈ 0.4. In this case the reproduction number assumes the limiting values R tically lowered and (probably) one can even see such an effect already at the early stage of the epidemic looking at the recent data on upper panel of Fig. 5 (yellow squares) . The same approach can be applied to evaluate the evolution of an epidemic secondary event at the moment of a partial relaxation of the isolation measures adopted. Our findings manifest an unavoidable occurrence of secondary events, however they can find our countries prepared thanks to the delay obtained in the first phase by means of isolation. The strategy to implement is largely based on technological resources opening a new era of fast screening. For a deeper discussion of the results one wonder if the choice of the moment can influence the secondary event in a substantial way. The need of saving the intense care from a large peak of presence pushes the inertia of the event to produce a long time tail it is very hard to keep isolation for a corresponding period. However one can analyze the effects of shift in time. In Fig. 8 the results of this further analysis. The technological improvement of the screening process remains the relevant mitigation ingredient and the structure of the secondary event does not change enough to suggest a further delay. "
69830,"This article describes a simple Susceptible Infected Recovered (SIR) model fitting with COVID-19 data for the month of march 2020 in New York (NY) state. The model is a classical SIR, but is non-autonomous; the rate of susceptible people becoming infected is adjusted over time in order to fit the available data. The death rate is also secondarily adjusted. Our fitting is made under the assumption that due to limiting number of tests, a large part of the infected population has not been tested positive. In the last part, we extend the model to take into account the daily fluxes between New Jersey (NJ) and NY states and fit the data for both states. Our simple model fits the available data, and illustrates typical dynamics of the disease: exponential increase, apex and decrease. The model highlights a decrease in the transmission rate over the period which gives a quantitative illustration about how lockdown policies reduce the spread of the pandemic. The coupled model with NY and NJ states shows a wave in NJ following the NY wave, illustrating the mechanism of spread from one attractive hot spot to its neighbor. }"

When planning for an upcoming reboot of the economy, it is essential to assess and mitigate the risks of relaxing some of the restrictions that have brought the COVID-19 epidemic under control. In particular, the policy strategy chosen must suppress a potential second exponential wave when the economy is rebooted, and so avoid a perpetual stop-and-go oscillation between relaxation and lockdown. Feedback and control models are designed with precisely this goal in mind. Having random testing in place, the risk of a second wave can be kept to a minimum. Additional testing capacity of r min = 7 700 day −1 tests (on top of the current tests for medical purposes) carried out with randomly selected people would allow us to follow the course of the pandemics almost in real time, without huge time delays, and without the danger of increasing the number of infected people by more than a factor of two, if our intervention strategy is followed. If testing rates r significantly higher than r min become available, a regionally refined analysis of the growth dynamics can be carried out, with G ≈ r/r min regions that can be distinguished. In the worst case scenario, where releasing certain measures immediately make the country jump back to the unmitigated growth rate of k 0 = 0.23 day −1 , random testing would detect this within 3-4 days from the change coming into effect. This is in stark contrast to the nearly 14 days of delay required for symptomatic individuals to emerge in statistically significant numbers. After such a time delay a huge increase (a factor of order 20) of infection numbers may have already occurred, which would be catastrophic. Daily random testing safely prevents this. Thereby the significant reduction of the time delay is absolutely crucial. Note that without daily polling of infection numbers and without knowledge about the quantitative effect of restriction measures, a reboot of the economy could not be risked before the number of infections has been suppressed by at least a factor of 10-20 below the current level. Given the limits of suppression rates that can be achieved without most draconic lockdown measures, this will require a very long time and thus translates into an enormous economic cost. In contrast, daily polling will allow us to carefully reboot the economy and adjust restrictive measures, while closely monitoring their effect. Since the reaction times are so much shorter, one can safely start an attempted reboot already at infection numbers corresponding roughly to the status quo. At some point one might consider the option to start releasing different sets of restrictions in different regions, with the aim to learn faster about their respective effects and thus to optimize response strategies in subsequent steps.

69854,"The rate of COVID-19 transmission in India is low as compared to countries like the United States, Spain, Italy, France, etc. So far, India is in a better position in the battle as compared to many other countries where spread was almost equal once but now total infected cases in those countries have gone up much fold (as on 23rd April). Given the very complex demography (e.g., population density, diversity, belief system), it raised challenges to the government in imposing the sudden restrictions on people to curb the virus spread. However, the Indian government managed to take bold and timely actions such as lockdown and mobility restriction to fight against COVID-19. Thus, considering the current situation in India, projection using a linear growth model is found suitable for this study. Now that India is resuming certain economic activities, it poses further speculations if the cases may rise again due to people's mobility and gathering. Under this circumstance, we considered two scenarios in our analysis; optimistic, and pessimistic. The optimistic scenario indicates that the spread of the virus follows the current trend with a complete lockdown in the infected states. The pessimistic scenario indicates that the growth of spread would be with a higher transmission rate due to people's non-compliance of social distancing norms due to removal or relaxation of lockdown. Thus, according to optimistic models, the COVID-19 pandemic in India will end in the 3rd week of June 2020 with a total of 77,900 cases. . CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0    "
69887,"The novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 has paralysed our societies, leading to self isolation and quarantine for several days. As the 10th most populated country in the world, Mexico is on a major threat by COVID-19 due to the limitations of intensive care capacities, and a total of about 1.5 hospital beds for every 1000 citizens. In this paper, we projected different scenarios to evaluate sharp or gradual quarantine lifting strategies, however, even in the hypothetical scenario that Mexico would continue with full confinement, hospitals would be reaching the maximum capacity of hospital bed occupancy. Mexican government is planning to relax the strict social distancing regulations on 1 June 2020, however, epidemic rebound risks are latent. Our results suggest that lifting social confinement needs to be gradually sparse while maintaining a decentralized region strategy among the Mexican states. To substantially lower the number of infections, predictions highlight that the elderly should remain in social confinement (approximately 11.3% of the population); the confined working class (roughly 27% of the population) must gradually return in at least four parts in consecutive months; and to the last the return of students to schools (about 21.7%). As the epidemic progresses, de-confinement strategies need to be continuously re-adjusting with the new pandemic data. Assuming the most optimistic scenario by our predictions, the smallest number of new COVID-19 cases, Mexico would require at least a 3 fold increase in hospital capacities dedicated for COVID-19. Furthermore, to observe the real dimension of the epidemic, Mexico would need to increase to at least 18 samples per 1000 people, currently is only 0.6 per 1000. All mathematical models, including ours, are only a possibility of many of the future, however, the different scenarios that were developed here highlight that a gradual decentralized region de-confinement with a significant increase in healthcare capacities is paramount to avoid a high death toll in Mexico."

Corona measures need to be taken carefully and timely. During the implementation of these measures, it is necessary to avoid practices that will cause the general public to panic. If this cannot be done, social distance measures will be neglected and measures to prevent the spread of the disease will be harmed. The spread of Covid-19 is central to the public health and the economy, therefore, we will follow the development of the confirmed growth rates closely. "
69938,"As the spread of COVID-19 worldwide progresses, it is important not only to protect human lives, but also to minimize social losses due to economic paralysis by detecting signs of spread at an early stage and predicting future trends accurately. This report introduces a new indicator (K) of the magnitude of the spread of COVID-19 based on daily number of infected people from publicly available data. Transitions of the K can predict effects of measures such as the blockage of cities and social distancing, signs of new spread, and possible regional dependence in the formation of population immunity."
69941,"It is apparent from results generated by our simulation model that both the timing and strength of social distancing measures have a substantial effect in reducing the number of infected individuals in a pandemic situation. In reality, it is unlikely that the initial arrival of infectious cases into a community would be identified in a matter of a few days. This suggests that delays may be expected if waiting for diagnosis to occur before activation of mitigating measures. The modelling results suggest that even with a significant delay in invoking mitigation strategies, 10 weeks in the case of data presented in Figure 1 , this delay and consequential growth in case numbers may be countered by the scale of interventions adopted, by combining multiple robust social distancing measures. The timing of activation of social distancing measures is a challenge facing public health authorities, balancing what needs to be done with what is feasible, and this will vary between countries. Our modelling gives initial guidance on the relative benefit of a range of mitigation strategies. As the COVID-19 pandemic develops more subtle strategies will need to be evaluated, such as the phased introduction of additional measures if it is found that existing strategies are ineffective in reducing daily case numbers. Similarly, modelling will be required to determine optimal strategies to phase the ending of interventions once the epidemic peak has passed. Models such as that presented here will have a key role in analysing these evolving situations. The results indicate that two separate social distancing measures are highly effective, case isolation and a 70% reduction in community-wide contact. Both of these measures may be strengthened further. Given we assumed that only cases are isolated, not the whole family, there is scope to increase the effectiveness of that strategy. The 70% community contact reduction intervention may also be further strengthened to a 90% reduction if required. Deciding on the strength or robustness of interventions will be a challenge for governments. There will be a need to balance what may be necessary to reduce the daily infection rate, and take pressure off health care resources, with what a population can sustain, such as a long duration of highly restrictive measures. Our modelling suggests that school closure is the least effective single social distancing measure considered, however it is highly disruptive as adults are needed to care for younger children. Its moderate effectiveness arises from our assumption that children still have contact in the wider community when schools are closed. This suggests that combining school closure with even a 30% reduction in community-wide contact will be significantly more effective. We have evaluated the effectiveness of very robust, combined social distancing interventions, which are very similar to those applied in South Korea (Sophia Rogers, personal communication). Much of the success of the measures used in South Korea is due to the population wishing to work together to minimize infections in others, by complying with the regular guidance given to them . CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0    ()  .   by their government e.g. by daily text messages. It is unclear whether this messaging would be successful in other countries. Future modelling should evaluate social distancing interventions which might be more applicable in countries such as the UK, other European countries, Australia or the USA. Questions that need answering include which interventions are feasible in a given setting and how effective would these be? Our modelling has assumed that interventions are held until a vaccine or treatment option appears, which may not be feasible, with really strong measures possibly leading to compliance fatigue after being held for long periods of time. To address this, modelling may be used to evaluate repeated cycles of starting and stopping interventions, given that we have demonstrated that starting and stopping robust combined interventions can significantly flatten the epidemic curve. The COVID-19 transmission characteristics assumed in our model produced an unmitigated infection rate of 66%, which included both symptomatic and asymptomatic cases, and a basic reproduction number of 2.2. Higher or lower R0 settings will affect case numbers under all the social distancing interventions considered. In the absence of definitive data on the proportion of infections which are asymptomatic, we assumed a 20% asymptomatic proportion though the actual percentage may be larger. Similarly, if the infectious period is longer than the 3 days assumed, the same caveat applies. However, our sensitivity analyses indicate that changing the underlying model parameters to reflect these modifications does not affect the relative effectiveness of the social distancing measures. "

This study aimed to explore the potential use of Google and YouTube relative search volume to predict social distancing index in Brazil during COVID-19 outbreak and verify the correlation between social distancing measures with the course of the epidemic. Data concerning the social distancing index, epidemiological data on COVID-19 in Brazil and the search engines trends for Coronavirus were retrieved from online databases. Multiple linear regression was performed and resulted in a statistically significant model evidencing that Google and YouTube relative search volumes are predictors of the social distancing index. The Spearman correlation test revealed a weak correlation between social distancing measures and the course of the COVID-19 epidemic. Health authorities can apply these data to define the proper timing and location for practicing appropriate risk communication strategies."
69970,"We have presented a generalized SEIQRD mathematical model with a time delay to analyze the spread of COVID-19 infection in a population. The proposed model incorporates spatial and stochastic parameters like heterogeneous population, natural births, deaths, and population migration networks within geographical state boundaries. Based on a detailed analysis of the available public data, we projected COVID-19 pandemic peaks and possible ending time and total infected cases in India. Overall, the current pandemic situation with nationwide lockdown is expected to end up by August, 2020, which is a much better scenario than no lockdown in place. Furthermore, we applied our mathematical model to interpret the public data on the total number of infected cases from March, 16, 2020 onwards in two sub regions of India, including Maharastra and Uttar Pradesh, as discussed in the appendix (D). With lockdown in place, the peak infection witnessed a significant fall in comparison to the situation if there would have been no lockdown indicating the potential benefit of lockdown in controlling the outspread. Our model suggests a bit relaxed lockdown, followed by an extended period of strict social distancing as one of the most effective control measures to manage COVID-19 spread in days to come. Further, capturing the impact of the delay on the pan-demic transmission, we carried the sensitivity analysis on time delay by varying its values systematically. No qualitative changes have been observed in the infection pattern apart from shifting of the curve resulting in possible domain range for estimated infection. Owing to significant spatial variations affecting the basic reproduction number R 0 , we included spatial heterogeneity by dividing the entire population into smaller sub regions. Based on the technique, R 0 and its timedependent generalization has been estimated at both regional and sub regional levels. The approach helped us to capture sensible COVID-19 infection dynamics over local and global levels. The proposed model is an attempt to provide deep insight to analyze the dynamics of COVID-19, helping the involved agencies to arrange and manage crucial resources and design its control strategies. Additionally, the proposed work necessarily made some assumptions when framing the model. We ignore the impact of infection spread due to exposed class [1]. Moreover, the work is based on acquired data for a limited duration of time to fit and estimate the spread of COVID-19. With the release of more epidemic data for India, owing to the regional differences on account of health, education, religion, and per capita income, the key parameters may undergo momentous changes influencing the spread of pandemic among the masses. We consider a large geographic region with total population N , partitioned into n states labeled by j = 1, 2, ...n. The population within the j th state is partitioned into susceptibles (S j ), exposures (E j ), infectives (I j ), quarantines (Q j ), recoveries (R j ) and deaths (D j ), where N j =S j +E j +I j +Q j +R j +D j and N = n j=1 N j . The proposed time delay SEIQRD system that captures population and geographic heterogeneities is given by:   was not certified by peer review)   Here β j > 0 is the average rate of contact between susceptible and infected (people exposed at each time step by infected people) in j th state; λ j,k ∈ [0, 1] denotes the population migration factor for the states j and k. The parameter σ ∈ [0, 1] stands for the portion of exposed individuals, which become infectious per time step and ∈ [0, 1] is the quarantine rate from the infection per time step. We call δ ∈ [0, 1] the proportion of quarantined people who are cured per time step and γ ∈ [0, 1] is the fatality rate due to COVID-19. The parameter τ > 0 is the delay time. Further, without affecting the behavior and general aspects of infection, it is assumed that the population in the j th state is born susceptible with the natural birth rate µ > 0 per one individual per time step and the total population remains constant since the natural death rate is considered to be same as the natural birth rate µ. The first term on the R.H.S. of Eq.(1) represents the fragment of the susceptible individual of j th state who have been exposed to the disease by the infected individuals of the same state and by the infected individuals of the other states, who have moved to the former main state, taking into account the average contact rate; migration coefficients for the states; and the relation between the populations of the states. Those who were exposed to the infection at time t − τ and survive the latent period [t − τ, t] with probability e −µτ moves to the infected class at time t [19, 20] . Moreover, the proportion removed by disease independent mortality for each compartment is given by the last term on R.H.S of each equation. From Eqs.(1) -(6), we get the normality condition S j (t)+E j (t)+I j (t)+Q j (t)+ R j (t) + D j (t) = 1 , for every state j at any time t. "
69988,"It has been seen from above that, in all the state except Gujrat & Karnataka, the lockdown as a containment measure has been quite successful. In India the lockdown started from from 25 th March-2020. After 11 to 13 days of the commencement of the same, seven provinces of India has shown us a signicant downtrend of instantaneous reproduction number. This lag between cause & its eect corresponds to serial time or the generation time interval, that varies from state to state. However, these two states show a opposite trend. After the passage of about one generational time interval, the instantaneous reproduction number peaks sharply. This might correspond to migration [24] at the beginning of the lockdown. In Karnataka, however the value of instantaneous reproduction number uctuates moderately. This is perhaps due to clustering [25] or inadequate testing policies [26] , which may be true for both of the states. In what follows next are two province specic case studies. We show that, the lockdown in India was fairly successful barring a couple of places, due to migration or superspreading etc. We note here that a similar study, with a bigger scope has been reported elsewhere [28] . But it assumes the parametric serial interval, which is dierent from ours. We have deduced our own serial interval (cf. sec. 3) by scraping the pan India raw data and by building our own line list & contact list. Hence Our result is presumed to be signicantly dierent from theirs and more representative of the actual scenarios [29] . The eect partial lifting of the lockdown (unlock) is also seen in the results, in terms of increment in R i (t). 8. Acknowledgement SM wishes to thank K. Bhattacharya, K.

70012,"Objective: In absence of any vaccine, the Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is being contained through a non-pharmaceutical measure termed Social Distancing (SD). However, whether SD alone is enough to flatten the epidemic curve is debatable. Using a Stochastic Computational Simulation Model, we investigated the impact of increasing SD, hospital beds and COVID-19 detection rates in preventing COVID-19 cases and fatalities. Research Design and Methods: The Stochastic Simulation Model was built using the EpiModel package in R. As a proof of concept study, we ran the simulation on Kasaragod, the most affected district in Kerala. We added 3 compartments to the SEIR model to obtain a SEIQHRF (Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Quarantined-Hospitalised-Recovered-Fatal) model. Results: Implementing SD only delayed the appearance of peak prevalence of COVID-19 cases. Doubling of hospital beds could not reduce the fatal cases probably due to its overwhelming number compared to the hospital beds. Increasing detection rates could significantly flatten the curve and reduce the peak prevalence of cases (increasing detection rate by 5 times could reduce case number to half). Conclusions: An effective strategy to contain the epidemic spread of COVID-19 in India is to increase detection rates in combination with SD measures and increase in hospital beds."

70029,"The responsible estimation of parameters is a main issue of mathematical pandemic models. Especially a good choice of β as the number of others that one infected person encounters per unit time (per day) influences the adequateness of the results of the model. For the example of the actual COVID-19 pandemic some aspects of the parameter choice will be discussed. Because of the incompatibility of the data of the Johns-Hopkins-University to the data of the German Robert-Koch-Institut we use the COVID-19 data of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) as a base for the parameter estimation. Two different mathematical methods for the data analysis will be discussed in this paper and possible sources of trouble will be shown. Parameters for several countries like UK, USA, Italy, Spain, Germany and China will be estimated and used in W.O. Kermack and A.G. McKendrick's SIR model. Strategies for the commencing and ending of social and economic shutdown measures are discussed. The numerical solution of the ordinary differential equation system of the modified SIR model is being done with a Runge-Kutta integration method of fourth order. At the end the applicability of the SIR model could be shown.

70099,"Under our model, the ability of NPIs to minimize deaths depends to a large extent on the maximum effect that NPIs could have on transmission, as captured by the parameter u max . If u max is high (0.9), our model predicts that maintaining transmission at a low enough level that hospital capacity will not be exceeded could be possible. If u max is low (0.5), our model predicts that there may be limited scope to curtail the pandemic, even if control is sustained for a long period of time. If u max is intermediate (0.7), our model predicts that the potential impact of control is sensitive to the value of R 0 . These results emphasize the importance of careful estimation of these parameters as the pandemic progresses [18] . This includes accounting for geographic differences in both u max and R 0 [19, 21] . The balance between minimizing deaths versus days under control is determined by the parameter c in our model, which mirrors the weighting between these factors that government leaders will need to consider as they make decisions in coming months. In the event that NPIs are effective, our analysis shows that they will need to be sustained at a high level until sometime in summer 2020, at which time they can be relaxed to a small degree but will still need to be maintained at a relatively high level thereafter.

70123,"Background: The outbreak of Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) began in January 2020 in the city of Wuhan (Hubei province, China). It took about 2 months for China to get this infectious disease under control in its epicenter at Wuhan. Since February 2020, COVID-19 has been spreading around the world, becoming widespread in a number of countries. The timing and nature of government actions in response to the pandemic has varied from country to country, and their role in affecting the spread of the disease has been debated. Method: The present study proposed a modified susceptible-exposed-infected-removed model (SEIR) model to perform a comparative analysis of the temporal progress of disease spread in six regions worldwide: three Chinese regions (Zhejiang, Guangdong and Xinjiang) vs. three countries (South Korea, Italy and Iran). For each region we developed detailed timelines of reported infections and outcomes, along with government-implemented measures to enforce social distancing. Simulations of the imposition of strong social distancing measures were used to evaluate the impact that these measures might have had on the duration and severity of COVID-19 outbreaks in the three countries. Results: The main results of this study are as follows: (a) an empirical COVID-19 growth law provides an excellent fit to the disease data in all study regions and potentially could be of more general validity; (b) significant differences exist in the spread characteristics of the disease among the three regions of China and between the three regions of China and the three countries; (c) under the control measures implemented in the Chinese regions (including the immediate quarantine of infected patients and their close contacts, and considerable restrictions on social contacts), the transmission rate of COVID-19 followed a modified normal distribution function, and it reached its peak after 1 to 2 days and then was reduced to zero 11, 11 and 18 days after a 1st-Level Response to Major Public Health Emergency was declared in Zhejiang, Guangdong and Xinjiang, respectively; moreover, the epidemic control times in Zhejiang, Guangdong and Xinjiang showed that the epidemic reached an ""inflection point"" after 9, 12 and 17 days, respectively, after a 1st-Level Response was issued; (d) an empirical COVID-19 law provided an excellent fit to the disease data in the six study regions, and the law can be potentially of more general validity; and (e) the curves of infected cases in South Korea, Italy and Iran would had been significantly flattened and shrunken at a relatively earlier stage of the epidemic if similar preventive measures as in the Chinese regions had been also taken in the above three countries on February 25th, February 25th and March 8th, respectively: the simulated maximum number of infected individuals in South Korea, Italy and Iran would had been 4480 cases (March 9th, 2020), 2335 cases (March 10th) and 6969 cases (March 20th), instead of the actual (reported) numbers of 7212 cases (March 9th), 8514 cases (March 10th, 2020) and 11466 cases (March 20th), respectively; moreover, up to March 29th, the simulated reduction in the accumulated number of infected cases would be 1585 for South Korea, 93490 for Italy and 23213 for Iran, respectively, accounting for 16.41% (South Korea), 95.70% (Italy) and 60.59% (Iran) of the accumulated number of actual reported infected cases. Conclusions: The implemented measures in China were very effective for controlling the spread of COVID-19. These measures should be taken as early as possible, including the early identification of all infection sources and eliminating transmission pathways. Subsequently, the number of infected cases can be controlled at a low level, and existing medical resources could be sufficient for maintaining higher cure rates and lower mortality rate compared to the current situations in these countries. The proposed model can account for these prevention and control measures by properly adjusting its parameters, it computes the corresponding variations in disease transmission rate during the outbreak period, and it can provide valuable information for public health decision-making purposes."
70142,"As the COVID-19 pandemic affects more and more countries and threatens to overload the critical capacity of health systems, the absence of a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine requires forceful nonpharmacological containment measures by governments. Among these measures, the restriction of mobility and social distancing have been implemented by many countries in an attempt to reduce the impact on health systems and save the time necessary to try more efficient treatments against this emerging pathogen. However, these measures have come up short in Spain to cut the progression of COVID-19, due to covert infections that characterize its silent and rapid transmission beyond areas with a high number of cases detected. To mount the strategy against SARS-CoV-2 and anticipate its trajectory, it is necessary, in addition to correctly modeling its epidemiological characteristics, to take into account as closely as possible the influence of the fluidity of social contacts that it uses to spread. Here we have shown that it is possible to construct the expression of the effective reproduction number R(t) capturing both the epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19 and those social patterns that facilitate its expansion. This expression enables an accurate evaluation of the spreading potential of SARS-CoV-2 on a given population and, moreover, the assessment of non-pharmacological interventions. Focusing to the current outbreak in Spain, we have analyzed the effects of different degrees of mobility restrictions κ 0 , using the expression for R(t) evaluated at the time t c when containment is applied. This way, we can accurately determine the effects on the slowdown and suppression of the epidemic caused by different degrees of confinement. Calculating the value R(t c ) we observe a transition as the set of confined inhabitants and the consequent social distancing increase. This transition defines a critical confinement, κ c 0 , that separates a supercritical 10 .

The exact critical confinement separating the supercritical and subcritical regimes is highly dependent on the underlying social structure and the intrinsic mobility patterns of each population. Furthermore, it depends on the time it is applied, since it depends on the available pool of susceptible agents that can be culled out from the system. The generality of the expression R(t) provided here makes it possible to apply it to any population, paving the way for implementing timely and well-founded epidemiological and socially based non-pharmacological responses.

70176,"With new cases of Covid-19 surging in the United States, we need to better understand how the spread of novel coronavirus varies across all segments of the population. We use hierarchical exponential growth curve modeling techniques to examine whether community social and economic characteristics uniquely influence the incidence of Covid-19 cases in the urban built environment. We show that, as of May 3, 2020, confirmed coronavirus infections are concentrated along demographic and socioeconomic lines in New York City and surrounding areas, the epicenter of the Covid-19 pandemic in the United States. Furthermore, we see evidence that, after the onset of the pandemic, timely enactment of physical distancing measures such as school closures is imperative in order to limit the extent of the coronavirus spread in the population. Public health authorities must impose nonpharmaceutical measures early on in the pandemic and consider community-level factors that associate with a greater risk of viral transmission."
70212,"In this section, we have performed numerical simulations of optimal control model (3) using Open-OCL [16] written in MATLAB programming. In order to carry out numerical solutions of the model, we use a set of rational parameter values which are shown in Table 1 . We simulate the model in two different ways. Firstly, we run the program of the model (1) without using any control variables and the simulated graph is shown in Figure 5 . Furthermore, we perform the simulation of model (3) with control variables (such as educational campaign, social distancing and treatment). In this case, the results for each compartment are presented in Figures  6-9 . Graphical outcomes are executed using the initial values: (3) with control, we simulate the optimal systems when all the three control variables (such as educational campaign, social distancing and treatment control) for coronavirus-2 disease (COVID 19) are employed. This time, we first run the program for the quarantined individuals for both cases (i.e. with and without control). Hence, the simulated outcome is illustrated in Figure 6 . Basically, we adopt this in order to see the comparison of the different individuals (quarantined, infected, isolated and recovered individuals) for with and without control in the same window. We also run the program of the infected, isolated and recovered individuals for both with and without control separately. The simulated results are represented in Figures 7-9 respectively.   ()   Figure 5 shows that the number of quarantined and infected individuals increases for first two days but probably in day three, it slightly reduces. From day five, the number of quarantined and infected individuals starts to grow whereas the number of isolated and recovered individuals soars from the initial state. However, it is noticeable that the number of susceptible individuals rises up for the first two days but for the next two days it decreases abruptly. Then it remains steady. This means that as the quarantined and infected individuals increase, the more individuals become isolated to get medical treatment as well as maintenance of social distancing, the more individuals get recovered. Figure 6 illustrates the influences of educational campaign and social distancing control on the quarantined individuals for 60 days timeline. Here, it has been noticed that both the three control measures significantly control the number of quarantined individuals. The effects of the three controls are obvious in the figure. The number of quarantined individuals rises up when no control is employed but with the application of controls though it shows a slight decrease in days 1-3 and 9-10, it sharply plunges for the other time interval.   ()   Figure 7 shows the influences of educational campaign, social distancing and treatment control on the infected individuals for 60 days timeline. From the figure, it has been observed that the number of infected individuals increases in the absence of control but when all three controls are employed, it shows a decreasing effect for the first eleven days and then gradually goes up. The reason behind the rise may be that the influence of educational campaign and treatment are not enough effective on infected individuals as no specific treatment for COVID-19 exists. Figure 8 demonstrates the effects of three control measures such as educational campaign, social distancing and treatment control on the number of isolated individuals for 60 days timeline. In this case, it has been seen that the three control measures remarkably influences the isolated individuals. The isolated individual goes up with time without controls whereas it initially increases but gradually goes down for the first ten days and then it soars for the rest timeline with the application of the three controls.   ()  Figure 9 depicts the effects of three control measures such as educational campaign, social distancing and treatment control on the number of recovered individuals for 60 days timeline. In this case, it is noticeable that the three control measures have significant influence on the recovered individuals. In the absence of control the number of recovered individuals is nearly zero for first ten days, then it shows a slight increase up to twenty days and finally it goes up. But this increase is lower than the expectation and also it is too small compared to the number of infected and isolated individuals. Hence to get the desired result, three controls have been employed and the recovered individuals swiftly booms for the implementation of educational campaign and social distancing as a prevention and treatment as cure of the disease COVID 19. COVID-19 is a highly contagious pandemic disease which is threatening the entire world with its devastating character. It is assumed that if the present trend of COVID-19 outbreak continues, then obviously humanity could face its most devastating pandemic. As there is no proper treatment with drugs or vaccines until to date, social distancing and educational campaign are the only ways to prevent and control people from being affected. Such a control strategy via mathematical modeling is discussed in the present study. The model is formulated considering three control variables by using the most well-known Pontryagin's Maximum Principle. Numerical simulations have been performed to illustrate the analytic results. After investigation, it is observed that social distancing and educational campaign as prevention and treatment as cure are much more effective for the reduction of quarantined, infected and isolated individuals and at the same time the recovered individuals show a remarkable ascendancy. Since no antiviral medication (vaccination / natural health products) is authorized to treat or protect against COVID-19, implementation of educational campaign, social distancing and developing human immune system may be the best ways for preventing the disease before it goes out of control. Therefore, it is high time we took effective and strict measures to combat against this most devastating disease. analyzed the model analytically and wrote some literature of the study.

70231,"Background COVID-19 is a virus which has lead to a global pandemic. Worldwide, more than 100 countries have imposed severe restrictions regarding freedom of movement amongst their citizens in a bid to slow the spread of the virus. These restrictions, which are part of a set of non-pharmaceutical interventions, have recently been classified by the Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker (OxCGRT) team and a nominal index measure has been defined for use by the wider international community. We address the use of this index measure to establish the degree and characteristics of control of the transmission rate of the virus within a representative sample of countries in the World and states in the United States of America. Methods Country specific, Susceptible-Infected-Recovered-Deaths (SIRD) models with latent dynamics were constructed using publicly available data for 23 countries and 25 states of the United States of America. Each of the models were linearised and classical frequentist error propagation was applied to them individually. The time varying, observable model parameters were extracted for each day that data was made available. The OxCGRT stringency index, p, was used to regress against these model parameters. The regression of the transmission rate as a function of p in each locale was through a linear parameter _s. In addition, macroscopic indices from the World Bank were used to explore inter-country variation in the measured parameters. Results The world average was _s=0.01 (95% CI 0.0102 - 0.0112) with an ensemble standard deviation of 0.0017 (95% C.I. 0.0014 - 0.0021), strongly indicating a universal behavior. While lockdown measures have been successful in curbing the spread, our study indicates that removing them too swiftly will result in the resurgence of the spread within one to two months. Reducing the stringency index by 10 will delay reaching the apex by about 6 months, where reducing it by 20 will delay by only four months. During the post-lockdown period it is essential to increase _s. For the system to remain sub-critical, the rate with which _s increases should outpace that of the decrease of the stringency index. The spread of the virus is found to be insensitive to the Gini index and other socio-economic indexes. The typical adjustment time to see the effects of control varied between 1.49 days for Peru and 38.09 days for Sweden. In the United States, the typical adjustment time to see the effects of control varied between 1.41 days for Colorado to 15.91 days for Ohio. Interpretation Given the measured characterisations of each locale, the effects of any change in non-pharmaceutical intervention may be anticipated and predictions can be made regarding the possible case load which is specific to that environment. This is accomplished by specifying an acceptable level of transmission, {beta}_f, given the prevailing economic and social constraints which uniquely determines an overall stringency of intervention level p. As a policy maker, there are possible intervention combinations to choose from and a combination must be selected that achieves p or greater."
70250,"The world has recently undergone the most ambitious mitigation effort in a century, consisting of wide-spread quarantines aimed at preventing the spread of COVID-19. The use of influential epidemiological models of COVID-19 helped to encourage decision makers to take drastic non-pharmaceutical interventions. Yet, inherent in these models are often assumptions that the active interventions are static, e.g., that social distancing is enforced until infections are minimized, which can lead to inaccurate predictions that are ever evolving as new data is assimilated. We present a methodology to dynamically guide the active intervention by shifting the focus from viewing epidemiological models as systems that evolve in autonomous fashion to control systems with an ""input"" that can be varied in time in order to change the evolution of the system. We show that a safety-critical control approach to COVID-19 mitigation gives active intervention policies that formally guarantee the safe evolution of compartmental epidemiological models. This perspective is applied to current US data on cases while taking into account reduction of mobility, and we find that it accurately describes the current trends when time delays associated with incubation and testing are incorporated. Optimal active intervention policies are synthesized to determine future mitigations necessary to bound infections, hospitalizations, and death, both at national and state levels. We therefore provide means in which to model and modulate active interventions with a view toward the phased reopenings that are currently beginning across the US and the world in a decentralized fashion. This framework can be converted into public policies, accounting for the fractured landscape of COVID-19 mitigation in a safety-critical fashion."
70276,"In this report we use a semi-mechanistic Bayesian hierarchical model fitted to sub-national death data for Italy. We parameterise the reproduction number, a fundamental measure of transmission intensity, as a function of an individual's mobility. We show that mobility, both visually and statistically, is associated with the onset and timing of major NPIs. Using our model, we estimate that the average reproduction numbers in all regions across Italy is currently below 1, suggesting that the major interventions implemented by the Italian government have controlled transmission and averted a major health catastrophe. We show that despite the large number of deaths attributable to COVID-19, the attack rates are far lower than required for herd immunity. Simulating 8 weeks into the future, we estimate that, if mobility remains the same, there will be a continued reduction in deaths and the epidemic will be suppressed. However, returns to pre-lockdown mobility of 20% or 40% from current levels may lead to a resurgence of the epidemic with more deaths than the current wave in the absence of additional interventions. Our modelling framework is novel in that we infer a latent function for infections, and, to the best of our knowledge for the first time, parameterise R t using mobility data. The use of mobility data as a proxy Given that interventions, such as extensive testing, contact tracing and social distancing are going to be implemented, our estimates can be viewed as being pessimistic. On the other hand, simulating 20% and 40% increase in mobility over the next 8 weeks is likely a conservative scenario. Our model uses the official deaths counts to estimate changes in transmission intensity. We did not use the reported number of confirmed COVID-19 cases because of potential biases arising from changes in the case definition and testing strategy adopted during the epidemic across the regions, which would be hard to correct for. As more information on new interventions are introduced we will include them in our modelling framework. Our results suggest that transmission, as well as mobility, need to be closely monitored in the future weeks and months. To date, it is hard to predict the extent to which new interventions will be able  "
70290,"This study showcases the important effects of public health interventions on human mobility and epidemic transmission. We study the effect of a seemingly unique policy implemented in Chile: small-area lockdowns. Our study suggests that small areas lockdowns could contribute for controlling the outbreak. Although an effect of a 0.4 reduction in the Re is small compared to the impact of other interventions, they may play a key-role as a coadjuvant for containment, once the decline has been established by other public health interventions, suiting it particularly well as an exit strategy for large-scale lockdowns. Human mobility may play an important role in the early stage of the COVID-19 epidemic (25) . Concordantly, our study shows an important reduction of mobility and concordant effects on the epidemic spread after the implementation of school and university closures. This effect should be understood beyond its obvious attributable impact on the reduction of transmission among school and young people, but as a modulator of urban mobility, adding more dynamic and complex pathways for the impact of social distance interventions. It seems likely that the early closure of schools and universities had a significant impact on the reduction of SARS-CoV-2 transmission during the first stage of the pandemic in Chile. Different countries have implemented lockdowns, although their impact on the spread and on the economy is still to be seen. However, experiences on Spanish flu in 1918 showed different trends in the epidemic morbimortality according to the strictness of the social distancing measures implemented, with better results for cities with earlier and more restrictive interventions (26) . While some countries are starting to bring their epidemic outbreaks under control, evidence on the effectiveness of current lockdowns is only now starting to come into focus (5, [27] [28] [29] . In Wuhan, China, the growth rate of the cases decreased after the implementation of a large-scale lockdown which included travel restrictions, quarantine and social distancing measures like closing of schools (27, 30) . In Huangshi the epidemic curve became flattened 9 days after a lockdown was implemented (27) . Nevertheless, the most adequate strategy for implementing a lockdown (scale and timing) is still a matter of controversy (31) . Interestingly, our study adds to the literature that small-areas lockdowns could also contribute as secondary measures for controlling the outbreak. Moreover, they could be particularly useful as a way out of large-scale lockdowns, after the epidemic outbreak was been already controlled. . CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0    "
70333,"COVID-19 point prevalence PCR community testing allows disease burden estimation. In a sample of London residents, point prevalence decreased from 2.2% (95%CI 1.4;3.5) in early April (reflecting infection around lockdown implementation) to 0.2% (95%CI 0.03-1.6) in early May (reflecting infection 3-5 weeks into lockdown). Extrapolation from reports of confirmed cases suggest that 5-7.6% of total infections were confirmed by testing during this period. These data complement seroprevalence surveys improving the understanding of transmission in London."
70346,"In the SIR model, the number of susceptible individual today equals to the persons who were susceptible yesterday minus the numbers who become infected today. As long as the disease is spreading the outstanding susceptible number declines each day. In addition, the persons who turn into infected today equals to the yesterday's number of susceptible multiplied by the rates of infection per day, but it might look unusual that we also multiply that result by how many were infected the previous day. This is because the rate of infection per day is for every infected individual. If 2 persons are infected the chance of any person else becoming contaminated is 2 times higher than 1 individual is infected. So any estimation of the rate of transmission of the disease needs information of the infection rate per day and the numbers of primarily infected and originally susceptible persons. At the beginning of an epidemic the number of persons becoming infected each day is perhaps bigger than the number recovering, so the number of infected will maintain growing until more person recover than be infected. The numbers of susceptible individual always reduces, but the number of infected and recovered at first goes up and then turn down. The model used in this study is data-driven, so they are as dependable as the data are. Compare to other model based studies [17] on different locations, at the beginning; the infection patterns of Bangladesh are in exponential growth stage. According to the available data, we be able to predict that the highest size of the COVID-19 outbreak using the SIR model will be nearly 94,59,845 if there is no intervention. With such a large population and for socio-economic conditions, it is not possible to maintain even 80% lockdown or social distances in Bangladesh. We assumed, by law and enforcements and self awareness 60% lockdown and social distances can be maintained. In accordance the final size of COVID-19 will be 3782558 cases which is obtained from the SIR model analysis. Early strict lockdown and social distancing is the key factors of prevented COVID-19 transmissions. Studies showed that several other countries such as UK, Germany, Italy and USA where this stringent action was employed only after COVID-19 entered community transmission stage (stage-3), and the outbreak became uncontainable. Additionally, different nations have different strategies as well as acquiescence levels due to several   ()   .   realistic considerations in enforcing the lockdown. This may have an effect on the final size of outcome. For example, the infection rates in Italy and USA are still not become stable after more than 30 days of lockdown. They have witnessed the uppermost percentage of death as well. Conversely, South Korea, Japan, Singapore etc. has shown significant decline by imposing lockdown [1] . As estimated in a recent study [16] , a reduction of infections in Australia can be evident only if the social distancing levels go beyond 80%. Assuming the same pattern as Australia in Bangladesh as well (even though the lockdown in Australia was more strict with stringent police control over person movement activities), we can assume that till April 30 (37 days from lockdown) very tiny effect of social estrangement will be observed. By this date, Bangladesh may have reported cases as many as 21579 if 40% of Bangladesh population are susceptible that are shown in Table 02 . This number could rise significantly if community transmission (stage-3) turns out and transmissions due to the movement of industries workers and laborers. In addition, on May 31, Bangladesh should observe the peak of transmission predicted 2940692, if no further strict lockdown imposed. To reach on the numbers of infection, on 30 th of May, Bangladesh should expect around 259270 patients on a single day. A latest study by Mandal et al.[20] has revealed that social distancing can decrease cases by up to 62% confirms the effect of social distancing, the similar prediction were made by our model (Table 01, and  Table 02 ). Exponential increase is thought throughout to consider for the worsen-case scenario. A reduction of 90-95% can bring the condition to more convenient. In addition, if Bangladesh pursues the case isolation approach strictly, it is anticipated that the infection curve will begin flattening out soon. Naturally, the degree of accuracy of these estimates remains to be seen. In conclusion, qualitatively, both models show that the epidemic is moderating, but recent data show a linear upward trend. The next few days will, therefore, indicate in which direction the epidemic is heading. This investigative estimate shows that the transmission rate of COVID-19 in Bangladesh will be as high as 9.4 million and for the socio-economic conditions and some other practical considerations it is not possible to impose most strict lockdown. However, still now, the transmission rate per day and basic reproduction number for Bangladesh are nearly the level of global (1.5 to 2.5) range [17] . Due to the questionable small amount of testing [1] compare to other countries referencing a low transmission rate per day and therefore the lesser basic reproduction number than world. The mathematical epidemiological model SIR is used to forecast the short-term and long-term outcomes. The SIR model assumes all the infection cases to be symptomatic, which is a limitation and could be underestimate the actual cases because of an unsure number of asymptomatic cases. With this constraint, the SIR model satisfactorily predicts the cases till today (April 18). The prediction indicates that Bangladesh will enter equilibrium by the end of the first week of June with estimated total number of cases to be approximately 3782558, if no further stringent measures taken by the Government of Bangladesh. It is projected that the effect of social distancing will be visible shortly by the end of April. However, Bangladesh is on the door to go into community transmission due to reported infringement of quarantine standard by people as well as other sociodemographic characteristics. The predictions completed using the epidemiological model in this study will be unacceptable if the transmission goes into stage-3 massively. In conclusion, the model is as good as the original data. On account of real time changes in data every day, the forecasting will therefore changes. For this reason, the outcomes from this study are supposed to be used only for qualitative understanding and rational estimation of the nature of pandemic, but are not meaningful for any judgment making or strategy/policy change.

70350,"Our findings suggest that a large proportion of the UK public may be suffering from feelings of depression, anxiety, and loss as a result of COVID-19 social distancing and isolation. Some already feel in need of professional mental health support. The social and psychological impacts identified through this study centred around the various losses that people are experiencing. Practical social and economic losses -the loss of (in-person) social interaction, loss of income and loss of structure and routine -led to psychological and emotional losses -the loss of motivation, loss of meaning, and loss of self-worth. Findings also suggest that participants generally found information on social distancing to be ambiguous. However, there were differing views as to whether the government was at fault (insufficiently clear communication) or that the terms themselves are ambiguous and a small minority of the UK public were taking advantage of the ambiguity. It was recognized that this ambiguity may have been designed to permit greater social freedom than the more extreme social distancing and isolation measures implemented in other countries. Additionally, there was universally high adherence to social distancing and isolation guidelines reported across the study sample, yet most participants had observed or heard of non-adherence in others. Participants were highly critical of such instances of nonadherence, citing lack of social conscience, lack of understanding and lack of enforcement as likely causes. Perhaps the greatest concern for participants was the uncertainty they faced over the duration of the social distancing and isolation measures, as well as their ability to cope longer-term. There was also uncertainty as to how they and others would act, with some .

A mathematical model has been established, which follows the actual data trend of COVID-19 spread in India. It has been proved from analytical (based on mathematical modeling) and simulation results that social distancing plays an important role in spread estimation. The effect of social distancing has been discussed with different social distancing rates. It has been found that social distancing can reduce spread from polynomial to linear. It has been also observed breakage in social distancing can rise spread from linear to exponentially. The maximum cases and recovery periods are also analyzed. It has been found that in the current spread scenario 60 days lockdown is required for complete recovery. "
70378,"In line with many other countries, the UK adopted a ""lockdown"" strategy to minimise social contacts and thereby reduce the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The restriction on non-essential travel and GP visits raised concerns that vaccine coverage in children might be substantially reduced (5), echoing similar concerns raised at the global level [11] . With the recent change to a 1+1 PCV13 schedule in the UK, which is reliant on the booster dose to maintain herd immunity [8, 9] , a substantial reduction in PCV13 coverage could compromise control of IPD. Our modelling study suggests that any potential impact of the social distancing policy on PCV13 coverage and herd immunity will be more than offset by a reduction in pneumococcal transmission such that a net reduction in IPD cases should occur. This reduction in IPD would be the result of an overall reduction in pneumococcal carriage prevalence over the first two years after the lockdown, unlike the IPD reduction achieved with PCV. Carriage studies in England before and after the introduction of PCVs have shown little impact on overall carriage prevalence with the reduction in carriage of vaccine serotypes offset by an increase in non-vaccine serotypes [12] . The overall reduction in IPD cases achieved by PCVs is the consequence of the generally lower CCR of the NVTs that replaced VTs in carriage. . CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0    "
70435,"The number of Infected represented in the previous figures corresponds to the number of active cases (and not new cases), understanding as such those people who are diagnosed with Covid-19 and who have not yet resolved the disease and, consequently, did not pass into the compartment of recovered population (R) or died (D) (it is for this reason that the peak in I occurs after that of new cases). In all cases, the release from confinement is applied on the days indicated in the figures, counted from March 13, so that 30 days correspond approximately to April 14, 45 days to April 29 and 60 days to May 14. In the case of the sudden de-confinement of 30% of the population showed in Figure 1 , it is observed how this involves the uninterrupted growth of the current wave and its continuity and amplification until the end of May. This means exceeding 400, 000 active cases at that date for all of Spain. On the contrary, the model shows how the maintenance of the confinement for 15 more days (April 29), involves the drastic limitation of the current epidemic peak to around 100, 000 active cases, as well as the generation of a second wave of cases peaking around mid-September. It should be noted that this second peak is delayed until 2021 when total confinement is extended to 60 days (May 14). A reduction in the number of deaths between the 30-day and 60-day scenarios to approximately half can be also seen in the central panel. In figure 2 , the most notable results are the growth in the final number of infected (from 400, 000 to 650, 000), unlike in the previous case. Of relevance also, is the appearance of a more prominent second peak in terms of active cases, that would occur prior to the scenario detailed above in figure 1 . Under this assumption and even with a 60-day confinement, the second peak would occur in late 2020. Similarly, an increase in the number of deaths produced by Covid-19 is to be expected also. Figure 3 shows important differences with regard to the previous scenarios where the de-confinement occurs suddenly. And most notably, even when compared to those that would be obtained with much longer total confinements. For example, at this gradual rate of de-confinement, started on day 30 from the start of confinement (March 13), the magnitude of the epidemic peak attained is comparable to that of a sudden de-confinement of around 40% of the confined population. This occurred 45 days after the start, on April 29. In contrast, the second peak in this progressive de-confinement at a rate of 50% higher than alpha since May 4, would reach a lower maximum number of active cases (110, 000 compared to 250, 000) than with the sudden release of 40% of the population confined on April 29. The total change in the number of deaths is also substantial between this scenario and the previous ones. If the reincorporation of confined population is carried out at a lower rate (30% higher than confinement rate), the best result is obtained. However, it should be emphasized that this progressive reincorporation would be more optimal -in terms of a lower burden of disease-if carried out not at 30 days since confinement but at least at 45 days. This can be seen in the left panel of Figure 4 , where a second epidemic peak is not observed during the remaining of 2020. Therefore, it would be possible to bring under control the current outbreak in satisfactory conditions, avoiding the appearance of a second wave of cases of Covid-19 during 2020. The most substantial difference therefore occurs based on the time at which the progressive reincorporation of the confined population is allowed. This results in a reduction from 250, 000 active cases to about 100, 000 active cases, if the start of progressive de-confinement is delayed from April 14 to April 29. Finally, by way of illustration, Figure 5 shows different dynamics in active and total cases for a generic model scenario in which the ratio α/τ varies decreasing from 1 to 0.5. As it can be seen in the upper part of the figure, when the ratio is 1 the effect of prolonging confinement is seen both as an increase in the size of the peak of active cases as well as for the total cases. This behavior is repeated in the other dynamics up to a maximum when the de-confinement rate (τ) doubles with respect to the protection rate (α). This effect is mainly noticeable in the total number of cases as well as in the appearance and dimension of the second wave of cases. This multipanel figure strongly suggests that releasing a large percentage of the population after the lockdown, results in larger and earlier peaks in the current and next epidemic waves. "

70479,"A micro-level approach on individual behavior and household structure in viewing COVID-19 transmission is proposed in this work. It caters linking infected status in more realistic way before compromising into macro-level. For instance, sneezing and surface touching are treated in a detailed manner. Meanwhile, we design the infection rate β in a unique way by amalgamating many factors relevant to direct transmission through sneezing. Manipulation of a decreasing function β of the minimum contact radius r bridges the scientific argument in propounding the physical distancing. Additionally, several notable factors are taken in modeling fomite transmission through surface touching. We enumerate the final effect of these as an accumulation over a period σd in the past that asymptomatic individuals walked around and freely sneezed. Moreover, with the aim of tolerating differences to and fro households, we introduce the effect of different household structures into the model involving the number of local households and the average number of household members. This leads to easier identification of low-risk and high-risk country in terms of the basic reproductive number on an earlier take-off period. Our model solutions using the final attribution (2.6) are in quite good agreement with available data from Germany and Sri Lanka. Unobservable effects that may represent reality, related to the optimal numerical values, have been hypothesized. The rule of thumb which we propose from our findings is that, considering long-term predictions over the active cases, Germany and Sri Lanka can ameliorate the endemicity level by increasing 1.5m to 3m and 1m to 4.5m minimum contact radius, respectively, and reducing the intensity of individual activities to 1/ 4 by any means of mass control. The latter should be the aspect the governments know better how to put into realization. Both measures can also be applied in combination flexibly, in the sense that those who cannot stick to one can apply the other. For some alternating choices between actions and outcomes, reduced magnitudes of the intensity of individual activities to 1/ 3, 1/2, 3/4 are also presented. Besides these choices, translating other intervention measures such as wearing mask in more secure way into equal reduction on β without having to stay away from friends/colleagues and minimize outdoor activities could be a possible outlook. Intensive cleaning of surfaces is also an additional intervention to mitigate fomite transmission. Finally, we realized that the data used in this study as well as corresponding results will not infer a longer period ahead. In the sense that data jump to larger values after April 11 than predicted, our findings should remain actual and the actions might even need emphasis. When the data devolve to lower values, we have been let to observe based on the historical progression of the active cases that the jump may not be so radical as well. It thus puts no harm to keep the results as guidance, which may be subject to minor-to-medium infringement. . CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0    ()  .  . CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0    ()  .   "
70565,"As we mentioned in section 1, the question on how and when to take what level of interventions to control an epidemic is highly challenging, particularly in light of multiple natures and capabilities of countries. In many cases, it is even hard to evaluate effectiveness until the end of epidemic, and there is always controversy on taking any one intervention. However, our findings contribute to several useful suggestions on controlling COVID-19 breakout. The first point is that highly effective surveillance and isolation strategy is necessary to control an epidemic in early stage. In theory, if this strategy can be executed in excellent level, there will be no huge breakout later on. The case in Wuhan is a sample that have not taken any effective surveillance and isolation in the early stage of COVID-19, resulting of huge difficulties on late interventions. Also, considering the area, transportation, migration flows and population density of a region, most countries cannot achieve excellent level of isolation in contain phase, probably only in fine or good level. The breakout of an epidemic is avoidable. But considering its low social and economic cost, this strategy is still a very cost-effective option. Secondly, the cases in Wuhan and London has demonstrated high effectiveness of suppression strategy to reduce the overall infection. Probably in the UK or similar countries, suppression will minimally require a combination of social distancing of the entire population, home isolation of cases and household quarantine of their family members. But its practical effectiveness is not possible to achieve as same as Wuhan, as the success of suppression strategy in Wuhan is based on locking down human mobility to community level and sufficient resource support from other cities or provinces in China. If there are no sufficient external support, it will be risky to take intensive suppression to entire country due to huge impacts on its economics. Also, taking such intensive intervention to control an epidemic will need to be maintained until vaccine released (up to 12 months or more). If intensive interventions are relaxed at any time points, the transmission will quickly rebound. This is more like a multi-modal curve when taking multi-intervention strategies. .

These people may have no or mild symptoms but been not checked as confirmed cases. This is one important issue that Zhong's SERI model [11] has ignored. It will answer the model [8] predicts practical infectious population in Wuhan that ten times over figures in [11] . Similarly, it could explain the estimation of practical morality ratio can be varied in [11] and [8] . Lastly, one limitation of our model is that its prediction of infections and deaths depends on a parameter estimation of intervention intensity that presented by average-number contacts with susceptible individuals as infectious individuals in a certain region. We assume that each intervention has the same effect on the reproduction number in different regions over time. The practical effectiveness of implementing intervention intensity might be varied with respect to cultures or many other issues of certain county. As implementing hybrid intervention, the policy needs to be very specific and well-estimated at each day according to the number of confirmed cases, deaths, morality ratio, health resources, etc. This paper conducts a feasibility study by defining a mathematical model named SEMCR that analyses and compares mitigation and suppression intervention strategies for controlling COVID-19 outbreaks in London and Wuhan Cases. The model was fitted and evaluated with public dataset containing daily number of confirmed active cases including Wuhan, London, Hubei province and the UK. The experimental findings show that the optimal timing of interventions differs between suppression and mitigation strategies, as well as depending on the definition of optimal. In future, our model could be extended to investigate how to optimise the timing and strength of intervention to reduce COVID-19 morality and healthcare demand in mobile application. "
70576,"Many countries have applied lockdown that helped suppress COVID-19, but with devastating economic consequences. Here we propose exit strategies from lockdown that provide sustainable, albeit reduced, economic activity. We use mathematical models to show that a cyclic schedule of 4-day work and 10-day lockdown, or similar variants, can prevent resurgence of the epidemic while providing part-time employment. The cycle pushes the reproduction number R below one by reduced exposure time and by exploiting the virus latent period: those infected during work days reach peak infectiousness during lockdown days. The number of work days can be adapted in response to observations. Throughout, full epidemiological measures need to continue including hygiene, physical distancing, compartmentalization, testing and contact tracing. This conceptual framework, when combined with other interventions to control the epidemic, can offer the beginnings of predictability to many economic sectors."
70581,"The system of equations (2), (3), and (4) is simulated to provide epidemiological scenarios using parameters estimated from data collected in São Paulo State [3] from February 26 to May 7, 2020 (see Figure 2 ). Based on those data, we estimated the transmission rates β y = 0.78 and β o = 0.897 (both in days −1 ), giving R 0 = 9.239 (partials R 0y = 7.725 and R 0o = 1.514), and the fatality rates α y = 0.00053 and α o = 0.0053 (both in days −1 ). Isolation was introduced on March 24, hence, we estimated the proportion in isolation of susceptible persons k = 0.528, which was the average proportion of daily proportions observed in São Paulo State from February 26 to May 3. Nevertheless, the observed data suggested an additional protection, and we estimated this protection as ε = 0.5 since April 4, which reduces the transmission rates to β y = 0.39 and β o = 0.4485 (both in days −1 ), giving R 0 = 4.62. Hence, from February 26 to April 3, the epidemics was driven by force of infection with R 0 = 9.239, and since April 4, by force of infection with R 0 = 4.62, however at each time R ef determines the number of new cases. In [30] and [31] we estimated the additional mortality rates based on the observed data, and concluded that their values did not provide log-term reliable values. For instance, this estimation resulted in 30% up to 80% of deaths of all severe CoViD-19 cases. For this reason, we estimated considering final deaths to be around 10% of elder persons, disregarding the observed data. Here, we concluded that the observed data must be taken into account, however delayed 9 days (fatality rates) or 15 days (fatality proportions). Instead daily collected CoViD-199 data, we used the accumulated data to estimate model parameters (see Figures 3, 4, 6 and 8) using Ω given by equation (13) , and retrieved the curve 44 .

70623,Determining the impact of non-pharmaceutical interventions on transmission of the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is paramount for the design and deployment of effective public health policies. Incorporating Apple Maps mobility data into an epidemiological model of daily deaths and hospitalizations allowed us to estimate an explicit relationship between human mobility and transmission in the United States. We find that reduced mobility explains a large decrease in the effective reproductive number attained by April 1st and further identify state-to-state variation in the inferred transmission-mobility relationship. These findings indicate that simply relaxing stay-at-home orders can rapidly lead to outbreaks exceeding the scale of transmission that has occurred to date. Our findings provide quantitative guidance on the impact policies must achieve against transmission to safely relax social distancing measures.
70708,"The COVID-19 outbreak has caused over 1.7 million (still increasing) confirmed cases globally as of April 10th, 2020. The levels of spread and severity of the virus lead to a wide-spread political and economic turmoil. We believe that two critical contributing factors need to be taken into account by the authorities to make effective decisions for controlling the spread of the virus: (i) being familiar with the most effective controlling measures and (ii) having a mathematical model to predict the spread of the virus. In this study, we provided information regarding both of these crucial factors. First, we investigated the importance of different measures such as quarantine, isolation, face mask, social distancing, etc. in controlling the virus in various countries. We then present a mathematical model to predict the spread of the virus in different countries. Our prediction shows an excellent match with the actual data up to now."
70737,"In February and March 2020, COVID-19 epidemic in South Korea met a large black swan effect by a Sincheonji cult mass infection in Daegu-Gyeongbuk area. The black swan made it difficult to evaluate that the current policies for infection prevention including social distancing, closing schools, hand washing, and wearing masks good enough or not. Therefore, in this study, we evaluated basic reproduction number (R0) and time-dependent reproduction number (Rt) of confirmed cases based on various kinds of populations, including total, Daegu-Geyoengbuk, except-Daegu-Gyeongbuk, Sincheonji, and except-Sincheonji. In total, it seems the infection is going to be under control, but this is never true because in the except-Sincheonji and except-Daegu-Geyongbuk cases, R0 is still above 1.0, and Rt is drifting around 1.0. This study could be used to determine government policies in the near future."

The implementation appears to be effective in reducing about 60% of new infections and deaths, and its effect also appears to be sustainable even after its removal. Delaying its implementation reduces its effectiveness. However, the direct economic cost of such a lockdown remains to be seen and whether the model is replicable in other Chinese regions remains a matter of further investigation."
70808,"Human mobility is a critical factor in transmitting communicable diseases. Accordingly, lockdowns with strict travel restrictions were implemented in several countries to fight against the covid-19 pandemic. A nationwide curfew was implemented in Sri Lanka, which had a significant impact on its economy. Since minimizing both covid-19 incidence and economic effects are two conflicting goals, the government of Sri Lanka declared its readiness to resume to activities and decided to partly relax the lockdowns, aimed at a gradual transition to ordinary life. Instead of ad-hoc lockdown or relaxation strategies, in this work we proposed a systematic lockdown relaxation strategy that can help in achieving the two conflicting goals. Considering the potential disease transmission during the post-lockdown period, as given by the epidemic models, we proposed an optimization model, from which the optimal region-based lockdown strategies were determined, while confining the covid-19 incidence to a number that is endurable to the country and minimizing the damage to its economy. In particular, we proposed to determine the extent of lockdown relaxation for each region such that all covid-19 patients could be provided ICU facilities and the contribution to economy by all provinces is maximized. Since the resulting optimization problem turned out to be non-linear and several of its functions were expressible as sums of single-variabled functions, we adopted the method of separable programming to generate solutions. Accordingly, we converted the non-linear functions to piecewise linear approximations and found the global optimum. In a more realistic setting, other constraints must be added to our model. For instance, it was mentioned in the introduction that during the lockdown period, the North Central province which acts as the agricultural hub in the country underwent least lockdown restrictions. If all agrarian activities must be continued in the post-lockdown period, the relevant constraint can be readily incorporated into our model, as a lower bound to the relaxation of this province. That adds another linear, single-variabled and convex constraint which does not change the solution criterion. However, if the government is looking forward to running different specific industries in different regions, our model needs further modifications. In that case, a decision variable could be indexed by two indices, one for the province and the other for the industry. Further, our model can be applied at any moment in the post-lockdown period by substituting relevant initial conditions. In addition, even if travel restrictions were reimposed on certain roads, the relevant input can be changed and the updated optimal lockdown levels could be determined by minimum modifications. Due to concavity and convexity of the objective functions and constrains, it is efficiently solvable, even if the inter-provincial mobility information were replaced by a subtler dataset such as inter-district mobility; which could be a significant improvement of our model in light of accuracy. Accordingly, our optimization model can be improved further to help the decision making process in sustaining the economy in post-lockdown Sri Lanka, preventing the excessive transmission of covid-19. It would be an interesting future research task to formulate an analogous optimization problem, in which the factors that integrate the individual economic contribution by provinces are included. .

70901,"The conclusions of this article are: ① In the prevention and control of the COVID-19 epidemic, traffic control and social distancing measures have played a very good role in controlling the spread of the epidemic. Nationwide, the effect of social distancing is better than traffic control. ② The two measures are complementary, and their combined effect will play a better role in epidemic prevention; ③ Traffic control and social distancing do not work everywhere. Traffic control only paly a role in cities with large GDP and population size, but not in cities with low GDP population size; In cities with lower population size, social distancing becomes inoperative. ④ The rapid and accurate transmission of information, a higher protection awareness of the public, and a stronger confidence of residents in epidemic prevention can promote the realization of the measure effects. The conclusions above have important implications for public health policy. Considering the complementary relationship between the two measures, they should be coordinated with each other when making policies. However, considering the regional heterogeneity of their effect, it is necessary to formulate measures according to the city's own situation, achieving precise epidemic prevention, and the need for such a strict measure as ""lockdown"" the city should be carefully weighed; considering the promotion of better information dissemination, high protection awareness and strong public confidence on the effect of the measures, we should increase the transparency of information, improve protection awareness of the public, guide   the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

Excessive prevention and control will inevitably bring negative effects. Severe traffic control completely blocked the flow of people and materials, which to some extent made it difficult for the timely replenishment of basic living needs. Social distancing measures such as closing communities and public places inevitably exacerbated the panic among the people and adversely affected the development of their mental health. Therefore, when actively taking prevention and control measures, we must also fully consider the possible negative impacts, reasonably grasp the implementation of the measures, and take supporting remedial measures to minimize the side effects of epidemic prevention and control.

The SIR epidemic model shows that growth will increase exponentially and will reach 1000000 in the next 2 months and it will be difficult for Pakistan healthcare system to cope with the situation. This model also suggests that the Nonpharmacological Interventions (NPI) such as social distancing, complete lock down or imposing curfew, observing hygiene by washing hands, using hand sanitizers and wearing mask can slow down the propagation of the COVID-19 and can reduce the exposure of susceptible population to the infectious population.

70934,"Recent months have shown that 2019-nCoV poses a dangerous risk to humans. In this study, we developed a SEIR model that incorporates social distancing as a preventive measure for disease spread. We conducted analyses of the model, including formulation of the basic reproduction number and stability of the disease-free equilibrium (defined as a state where the disease is eradicated). Our analyses show that social distancing play directly affects the basic reproduction number, and hence the stability of the disease-free equilibrium. Our model simulations demonstrate that the total disease burden from 2019-nCoV can be mitigated by flattening the curve with a carefully chosen value for the coefficient of social distancing.

70997,"The lockdown response to COVID-19 has caused an unprecedented reduction in global economic activity. We test the hypothesis that this has reduced tropospheric and ground-level air pollution concentrations using satellite data and a network of >10,000 air quality stations. After accounting for the effects of meteorological variability, we find remarkable declines in ground-level nitrogen dioxide (NO2: -29 % with 95% confidence interval -44% to -13%), ozone (O3: -11%; -20% to -2%) and fine particulate matter (PM2.5: -9%; -28% to 10%) during the first two weeks of lockdown (n = 27 countries). These results are largely mirrored by satellite measures of the troposphere although long-distance transport of PM2.5 resulted in more heterogeneous changes relative to NO2. Pollutant anomalies were related to short-term health outcomes using empirical exposure-response functions. We estimate that there was a net total of 7400 (340 to 14600) premature deaths and 6600 (4900 to 7900) pediatric asthma cases avoided during two weeks post-lockdown. In China and India alone, the PM2.5-related avoided premature mortality was 1400 (1100 to 1700) and 5300 (1000 to 11700), respectively. Assuming that the lockdown-induced deviations in pollutant concentrations are maintained for the duration of 2020, we estimate 0.78 (0.09 to 1.5) million premature deaths and 1.6 (0.8 to 2) million pediatric asthma cases could be avoided globally. While the state of global lockdown is not sustainable, these findings illustrate the potential health benefits gained from reducing 'business as usual' air pollutant emissions from economic activities."
71024,"Here we use a metapopulation model applied at county resolution to simulate the spread and growth of COVID-19 incidence in the continental United States. We calibrate the model against county-level incidence data collected between February 21, 2020 and March 13, 2020, and estimate epidemiological parameters including the fraction of undocumented infections and their contagiousness1. Using the calibrated model, we project the outbreak in the continental US for 180 days after March 13, 2020, and evaluate the effects of social distancing and travel restrictions on the outbreak."
71124,"We investigatethe trade-offs between the time of release of lockdown and the consequent impact on the number of infections. In the analysis, a fraction of the population, h, that is under lockdown is eliminated from consideration during the initial stages of the infection, and is then re-introduced into the model when the lockdown restrictions are relaxed. Removal of restrictions of the lockdown impacts the susceptible population. We consider two strategies for removal of restrictions. In the first strategy restrictions are relaxed on an equal fraction of the population at distinct times and we determine the earliest time of such release, subject to conditions on growth of active cases. In the second scenario the population is released gradually in small fractions over time and we determined the impact of the release strategy on the number of active cases. We focus on the number of active cases as this metric is important for health-care systems. The current population under lockdown is estimated using the mobility numbers to roughly 50% average (The Google COVID-19 Community Mobility Reports [23] indicate a 45% decrease in transit and workplace mobility in New York). The analysis of the spread of the infection utilized both the SIR and SEIR models, and in order to fit the models we minimized an error function. The parameter space includes the size of the initial susceptible population, β and γ, the parameter for recovery time, guided by reports that the typical recovery time have a mean value of 14 days [24]. However the recovery data did not indicate a mean recovery period of 14 days but a much longer period. We describe the determination of the model parameter in a later section 4. Details of these parameter estimates are provided for two states, Illinois and New York . The SIR model provided a more accurate fit of the model and is used in our results on release strategies. "
71127,"Background: The rapid expansion of the current COVID-19 outbreak has caused a global pandemic but how quarantine-based measures can prevent or suppress an outbreak without other more intrusive interventions has not yet been determined. Hong Kong had a massive influx of travellers from mainland China, where the outbreak began, during the early expansion period coinciding with the Lunar New Year festival; however, the spread of the virus has been relatively limited even without imposing severe control measures, such as a full city lockdown. Understanding how quarantine measures in Hong Kong were effective in limiting community spread can provide us with valuable insights into how to suppress an outbreak. However, challenges exist in evaluating the effects of quarantine on COVID-19 transmission dynamics in Hong Kong due to the fact that the effects of border control have to be also taken into account. Methods: We have developed a two-layered susceptible-exposed-infectious-quarantined-recovered (SEIQR) meta-population model which can estimate the effects of quarantine on virus transmissibility after stratifying infections into imported and subsequent community infections, in a region closely connected to the outbreak's source. We fitted the model to both imported and local confirmed case data with symptom onset from 18 January to 29 February 2020 in Hong Kong, together with daily transportation data and the transmission dynamics of COVID-19 from Wuhan and mainland China. After model fitting, epidemiological parameters and the timing of the start of quarantine for infected cases were estimated. Results: The model estimated that the reproduction number of COVID-19 in Hong Kong was 0.76 (95% CI, 0.66 to 0.86), achieved through quarantining infected cases -0.57 days (95% CI, -4.21 - 3.88) relative to symptom onset, with an estimated incubation time of 5.43 days (95% CI, 1.30 - 9.47). However, if delaying the quarantine start by more than 1.43 days, the reproduction number would be greater than one, making community spread more likely. The model also determined the timing of the start of quarantine necessary in order to suppress an outbreak in the presence of population immunity. Conclusion: The results suggest that the early quarantine for infected cases before symptom onset is a key factor to prevent COVID-19 outbreak."
71149,"Based on the individual national risk, the immediate action of response, preparation, and readiness is an obvious step for countries that belongs to 4Cs (no cases, first cases, first clusters, and community transmission and spread). However, this study involves the scrutiny of national preventive actions, health care resources, life expectancy, and comorbidities towards the COVID-19 pandemic. Quite a few associations, correlations, as well as comparisons, have used throughout the investigations to find the relevant insights about the epidemic. The analyses of the top twenty saddling, as well as the least affected countries, have identified roughly the reasons along with the taken national health care actions. Those nations who have shown the apathy of taking immediate health care actions after the first identified case brand their circumstances more dreadful. Besides, similar lethargy of taking the immediate health care action also seen in some least burdening countries and marked as in danger. Moreover, there is an acute emergency of taking immediate health care actions to control the pandemic as most of the least saddling countries found the benefits. Also, the findings of this paper support that the COVID-19 case fatality of a country is affected by the number of physicians, hospital beds, and nurses and midwives since it has observed that there is a high COVID-19 case fatality in those countries that have a lower number of physicians, hospital beds, and nurses and midwives. The evidence of the study also validates that the increasing number of doctors, hospital beds, and nurses will result in a decline in the number of deaths from COVID-19. A stimulating finding is that the countries having higher life expectancy appear to have radically lower fatality rate in the epidemic.

Further, delaying the reduction of lockdown measures show a reasonable reduction in the number of predicted infected cases. Eventually, this study highlights the risks of hasty reduction of lockdown measures in countries in the middle of their battle with COVID-19. This study aims mainly to ring alarm bells for the risks accompanied by the rash loosening of the quarantine measures. Moreover, this paper introduces a comprehensive worst-case view of shifting into the heard immunity paradigm. Our calculations ignored any external measures to combat the COVID-19 second wave.

71281,"The COVID-19 pandemic has forced governments to take measures to contain the spread of the disease; however, the effects have varied significantly from one country to another contingent on governments' responses. Countries that have flattened their coronavirus curves prove that interventions can bring COVID-19 under control. These achievements hold lessons, such as the strict social distancing and coordinated efforts of all government levels in China and massive testing in South Korea, for other countries battling the coronavirus around the world. In this work, we attempt to estimate how many COVID-19 cases could have been prevented in the United States (US) when compared with the US's actual number of cases assuming that on a certain date, the US took China-like or South Korea-like interventions and that these interventions would have been as effective in the US as in China and South Korea. We found that if that date was at the early stage of the outbreak (March 10), more than 99% (1.15 million) fewer infected cases could be expected by the end of the epidemic. This number decreases to 66.03% and 73.06% fewer infected cases with the China-like scenario and the South Korea-like scenario, respectively, if actions were taken on April 1, highlighting the need to respond quickly and effectively to fight the virus. Furthermore, we found that although interventions in both China and South Korea allowed the COVID-19 outbreak to be managed, the epidemic could still oscillate without strict large-scale lockdown measures, as shown in South Korea. Our results demonstrate that early effective interventions can save considerably more people from infection and provide a worldwide alert regard the need for swift response."
71306,"The United States has enacted a complex combination of responses to COVID-19. Government policy varies in space, scale, and time (Table S2 and S3), resulting in varied patterns of movement and behavioral changes throughout the country. Simultaneously, the progression and intensity of local outbreaks differs markedly by location. This landscape makes quantifying the impact of social distancing on COVID-19 spread a nontrivial task. Nevertheless, our methodology captures relevant trends in human behavior as it relates to the spread of the disease. Because our analysis uses real-time mobility data at the individual level, we capture the dynamics of social distancing without relying on assumed efficacy of shelter-in-place orders. Additionally, we use the real-world frequency of trips, not extrapolated transmission rates or travel distances, as our mobility indicator. This means our social distancing metric is driven purely by how much people actually move, both between and within counties. Since our case   ()   . data consists simply of reported cases at the county level, our analysis is a powerful comparison of actual human behavior and the documented reality of COVID-19 in the US. Our results use this real-world data to show that social distancing is a useful technique to help the United States ""flatten the curve"" of new cases, demonstrating a strong and statistically significant correlation between social distancing and reduction of COVID-19 case growth. Importantly, our statistical analysis reveals that the effect of social distancing on decreasing transmission is not perceptible for nine to twelve days after implementation. Besides emphasizing its necessity, this study also reveals that social distancing (and outbreak growth deceleration) in the counties most affected by COVID was driven primarily by local-level regulations and changes in individual-level behavior; the state (and federal) actions implemented were done so either too late (or not at all). This is an important insight, as it demonstrates (given the clear correlation we present between social distancing and case growth), that it is within the power of each U.S. resident, even without government mandates, to help slow the spread of COVID-19. Critically, if individual-level and local actions were not taken, and social distancing behavior was delayed until the state-level directives were first implemented, COVID-19 would have been able to circulate unmitigated for additional weeks in most locations, inevitably resulting in more infections and lives lost. Further, the strong relationship between social distancing and outbreak case growth rates suggest that a return to 'normal' interaction patterns will result in an increase in case growth rates, which may appear 9-12 days after behavioral changes ensue. However, under these changes, additional precautions such as hand washing, wearing masks and self-isolation when sick may help to lessen the case growth rates. This study is subject to multiple limitations. First, we focus on quantifying the relationship between social distancing and case growth rates, therefore the role of other potential mitigating factors (e.g., wearing masks, hand washing, etc.) that could also have contributed to the decline in the case growth rate observed during March are not accounted for. Second, we use the growth rate ratio (GR) as our representative variable for the degree of transmission occurring in a region. We believe this is an intuitive and representative estimate for the spread of COVID-19 amongst a local population, but future extensions of this analysis can explore replacing this variable with more traditional transmission indexes commonly used in infectious disease epidemiology. Third, the case data is error prone due to both reporting issues and limited testing capacity, especially in early March before widespread testing was underway. We partially address this issue by using a 3-day moving average for the case data. Forth, the analysis is focused on 25 counties which may represent a biased sample of locations; however, the same results are shown to hold when extrapolated up to the state level, which lends additional confidence to the conclusions. Last, the data used in this analysis does not differentiate amongst sociodemographic groups, and therefore may not representatively capture all groups such as the elderly, low income families and underrepresentative minorities, for whom social distancing may not be an option, or may not have cell phones. In conclusion, our results strongly support the conclusion that social distancing pays dividends in the vital reduction of load on hospital systems in the United States. It may be difficult to recognize the value in safe behavior when the reward is not obvious, and the danger is not immediate. This is particularly true given the economic and social repercussions of the COVID-19 response. Nevertheless, given the lack of proven antiviral drugs or a vaccine, social distancing is the most important and timely way to combat the spread of COVID-19 (17, 18) . These findings also highlight the difference in pandemic control policy between the U.S. and China and should serve to support more timely policymaking in the U.S. moving forward. This is particularly relevant as the U.S. begins to loosen stay at home orders, once again ng so in a highly decentralized manner. We hope that our results will motivate both individuals and decision makers in the US to take seriously the importance of advocating for safe and data-driven policy in the face of this pandemic, while balancing its impact on associated communities.

Across the United States we estimate as of April 18, 2020 the fraction of the population infected was 4.6% [3.6%, 5.8%], 21 times the portion of the population with a positive test result. Excluding New York state, which we estimate accounts for over half of infections in the United States, we estimate an infection rate of 2.3% [2.1%, 2.8%]. We include the timing of each state's implementation of interventions including encouraging social distancing, closing schools, banning public events, and a lockdown / stay-at-home order. We assume fatalities are reported correctly and infer the number and timing of infections based on the infection fatality rate measured in populations that were tested universally for SARS-CoV-2. Underreporting of deaths would drive our estimates to be too low. Reporting of deaths on the wrong day could drive errors in either direction. This model does not include effects of herd immunity; in states where the estimated infection rate is very high - namely, New York - our estimates may be too high."

Stated differently, our model implies that social distancing reduced the total number of COVID-19 cases by approximately 3,000 cases at 7 days after implementation, and by 68,000 cases at 14 days. These results are consistent with both the theoretical effect of social distancing on epidemic spread (5) and the historical benefit observed implementing such interventions during prior epidemics of communicable diseases (11) . Our findings should be interpreted with the following limitations in mind. Our estimates would be biased toward the null if: 1) state and local governments had intensified social distancing measures in response to a worsening epidemic, 2) there were significant violations of the stable unit treatment value assumption (e.g., workplace closures of large employers that had spillover effects across state lines), or 3) surveillance and testing intensified during the study period (thereby resulting in increased case reporting). Moreover, statewide restrictions on internal movement were often implemented after other social distancing measures had already been applied, further biasing our estimate toward the null. Our study was also limited by little observation time after statewide restrictions on internal movement were implemented. Finally, our estimated effects of social distancing in terms of mean daily case growth rates cannot be extrapolated linearly beyond the study period, nor can they answer questions about the appropriate timing of rescinding such measures. In summary we demonstrate that the U.S. COVID-19 epidemic growth rate declined within approximately one incubation period following the initiation of statewide social distancing measures.   author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

71347,Staying home is an important part of the effort to contain COVID-19 and limit deaths. Every state in the United States has enacted policies to encourage distancing and staying home. An important question is how these policies interact with individuals voluntary responses to COVID-19 cases and deaths. We find evidence of a non-trivial voluntary response to local and nationally reported COVID-19 cases and deaths.
71349,"Most modelling studies to date rely on daily WHO 10 or ECDC 11 data reports, which gather cumulative death and positive test counts across countries. These datasets are made openly available as part of a global collaborative effort to fight the COVID pandemic (see: ). In addition, a few governmental agencies have recently made an effort to assemble and make openly available richer datasets, including, e.g., ICU occupancy and remission counts (e.g., for France see: ). As with most modelling studies performed so far during the COVID pandemic, previously communicated applications of the LIST model fitted daily death (hereafter  (3) 1,3 2,3 . CC-BY-ND 4.0    In this work, we have extended the LIST model to account for the potential impact of adaptive social distancing on the generation of secondary epidemic waves. In particular, we focused on the notion of network unreachability, i.e., the fact that when 'at-work' connections get pruned from the network, some people may no longer be susceptible to the virus. We have demonstrated the impact of this mechanism on the COVID epidemic using both numerical simulations and data analyses. In particular, we have shown that, rather than generating catastrophic post-lockdown secondary outbreaks, this kind of processes interact with other nonlinear mechanisms, eventually yielding protracted post-lockdown dynamics of epidemiological outcomes. We have also shown that observable inter-regional differences, including the impact of governmental lockdown on health and economic outcomes, may be partially explained by regional idiosyncrasies in resistance and unreachability rates (which themselves may partially originate from differences in the relative timing of infection dynamics w.r.t. lockdown). For the purpose of our demonstration, we made a number of predictions regarding epidemiological outcomes, including death rates and acquired immunity levels. At this point, we acknowledge a few weaknesses of our approach. First, we derived our predictions from model-based analyses of available epidemiological French data: namely, daily death rates, positive case rates, ICU occupancy and remission rates. These time series are already more informative than most data available from international data repositories (which only report death and positive case rates). Nevertheless, currently available data are noisy (cf. weekly artefactual drops, heterogeneous sampling by testing laboratories, etc.), preliminary (from the perspective of the global time course of the pandemic), and scarce (they do not relate to all hidden factors of the LIST model). In particular, should time-resolved data regarding the population adherence to social distancing and/or immunity levels be available, the reliability of model-based predictions will be considerably strengthened (Daunizeau et al., 2020) .

71360,"I presented a rough estimate of a ROC curve to simulate how increasing the number of tests slow the spread of COVID-19. An important point that is easily overlooked is that knowing the TP rate relative the number infection cases is likely more useful than knowing the absolute number of tests or number of tests per capita, as is often reported in the news media. In fact, the relation between the number of tests and proportion of detected cases out of all positive cases is indicated by the TP rate. In the current crises, this is unknown. Nonetheless, with plausible values of the TP rate one can model the impact of increasing TP rates. With a modified SEIR model, I have shown that simulations of virus spread can produce valid estimates of currently infected persons and enable estimates of future growth under different scenarios. It has become painfully obvious that the number of COVID-19 cases in New York will still be increasing for some time. A critical strategy is to reduce the reproduction number by reducing contact and movement because the growth factor has an exponential effect. However, at this point in time it may not by itself slow the spread enough unless restrictions become draconian and long lasting. More testing and quarantining will help mitigate the rise, but if testing is going to copy the South Korean numbers, the testing in New York must increase faster than the virus spread, perhaps to get up to 15 to 1 ratio of new cases (as of March 28 th , that would be about ~75000 tests per day). But just as important is to increase efficacy by collecting good data to better score and allocate tests. A good scoring model and allocation strategy, that increases TP rate by a one or two percentage points could have the same impact as increasing the number of tests by tens of thousands. The scoring model perhaps could include contacts and locations, along with demographics, weather, type of places visited, time of day, and anything else that could help build a robust model on top of virus spread models and tracking contacts. In some high profile machine learning competitions, intensive application and modeling efforts have shown improvements of 10 percentage points in accuracy (e.g. Netflix Prize, Wikipedia, Zillow Landing Pages). There should be low technical or material barriers to gathering and using data, and I would argue that health agencies should start ng so and making the anonymized data available. .

71393,"Background: The emerging SARS-CoV-2 virus has caused a global pandemic characterized by superspreader events. Heterogeneity in transmission risk is a known phenomenon in infectious diseases and was also seen in SARS and MERS outbreaks since 2003. The pandemic has led countries to control the pandemic spread using unprecedented severe mitigation strategies that include quarantine and lock-down. This has has been highly successful in terms of halting the spread, but had enormous socioeconomic cost. We set out to theoretically explore whether a model that includes the phenomenon of superspreaders may guide us towards a cost-effective mitigation strategy. Methods: We developed an agent-based model that includes persons that spread the disease far more readily than other persons. This allow us to investigate effect of containment strategies in both a random SEIR like scenario, and in a transmission model that work with structured society. Our model considered even contact patterns in three settings: home, work and a category of ""other"" settings representing diffuse social contacts. We introduced superspreaders either as a fixed proportion of the population, or as a broad spectrum of infectivity. For each choice, the model was then calibrated to an overall realistic daily growth rate of 23 percentage. As sensitivity analyses we varied the fraction of superspreaders as well the distribution of their infectivity. To compare the simulation findings for each mitigation scenario we considered the maximum daily ICU utility. Results: As expected, without mitigation imposed, the inclusion of superspreaders does not meaningfully change the epidemic trajectory. However when introducing mitigation strategies imposed on each of the three settings, we find that the presence of superspreaders made a substantial difference. The simulations demonstrate that the best strategy is to focus on limiting contacts in the other category. This in particular suggests that limiting diffuse social contacts in settings such as bars, transportation, restaurants, parties, concerts and lecture halls is far more effective than limiting the same amount of contact events in the home and work setting. Conclusions: To appreciate effect of heterogeneity in various social spheres we need to rethink disease transmission models. ng so, we found that wide distribution of infectivity favours strategies that reduces the max, while leaving the typical behaviour undisturbed. We found that most workplaces may be opened without much influence on the epidemic, while one could snuff out transmission with an effective avoidance of other contacts. Interestingly, including a consideration of superspreaders can help explain the dramatic success of even moderate lock-down strategies as that practiced in Denmark and Sweden. And it points to the need to avoid mass gatherings until either flock immunity has been achieved or an effective vaccine is available."
71472,"Since COVID-19 emerged in early December, 2019 in Wuhan and swept across China Mainland, a series of large-scale public health interventions, especially Wuhan lock-down combined with nationwide traffic restrictions and Stay At Home Movement, have been taken by the government to control the epidemic. Based on Baidu Migration data and the confirmed cases data, we identified two key factors affecting the later (e.g February 27, 2020) cumulative confirmed cases in non-Wuhan region (y). One is the sum travelers from Wuhan during January 20 to January 26 (x1), which had higher infected probability but lower transmission ability because the human-to-human transmission risk of COVID-19 was confirmed and announced on January 20. The other is the seed cases from Wuhan before January 19, which had higher transmission ability and could be represented with the confirmed cases before January 29 (x2) due to a mean 10-day delay between infection and detection. A simple yet effective regression model then was established as follow: y= 70.0916+0.0054*x1+2.3455*x2 (n = 44, R2 = 0.9330, P<10-7). Even the lock-down date only delay or in advance 3 days, the estimated confirmed cases by February 27 in non-Wuhan region will increase 35.21% or reduce 30.74% - 48.59%. Although the above interventions greatly reduced the human mobility, Wuhan lock-down combined with nationwide traffic restrictions and Stay At Home Movement do have a determining effect on the ongoing spread of COVID-19 across China Mainland. The strategy adopted by China has changed the fast-rising curve of newly diagnosed cases, the international community should learn from lessons of Wuhan and experience from China. Efforts of 29 Provinces and 44 prefecture-level cities against COVID-19 were also assessed preliminarily according to the interpretive model. Big data has played and will continue playing an important role in public health."
71479,"Pandemics such as the one caused by Covid-19 can pose an existential threat to our social and economic life. The disease in itself is serious, and leaves specific epidemic signatures and characteristics that make traditional contact tracing difficult. In particular it is highly infectious, sometimes infects already 2 days after infection and has a large fraction of non-symptomatic cases. As such it is difficult to contain without a system-wide lockdown of society. Nevertheless, a successful containment in South Korea used contact tracing. This motivated us to explore a one-step contact tracing/quarantine strategy (1STQ). "
71491,"The crucial questions about an outbreak is how, when (DAY-ZERO), why it started and when it will end. Answers to these important questions would add critical knowledge in our arsenal to combat the pandemic. The tracing of DAY-300 ZERO, in particular, is of outmost importance. It is well known that minor perturbations in the initial conditions of a complex system, such as the ones of an outbreak, may result in major changes in the observed dynamics. No doubt, a high level of uncertainty for DAY-ZERO, as well as the uncertainty in the actual numbers of exposed people in the total population, raise several barriers 305 in our ability to correctly assess the state and dynamics of the outbreak, and to forecast its evolution and its end. Such pieces of information would lower the barriers and help public health authorities respond fast and efficiently to the emergency. This study aimed exactly at shedding more light into this problem, taking 310 advantage of state-of-the-art tools of mathematical modelling and numerical analysis/optimization tools. To achieve this goal, we addressed a new compartmental SEIRD with two infectious compartments in order to bridge the gap between the number of reported cases and the actual number of cases in the total population. By following the proposed methodological framework, we 315 found that the DAY-ZERO in Lombardy was the 21th of January, a date that precedes by one month the fate of the first confirmed case in Lombardy. Furthermore, our analysis revealed that the actual cumulative number of infected cases in the total population is around 15 times more the cumulative number of confirmed infected cases. Importantly, based on our simulations, we predict 320 that the fade-out of the outbreak in Lombardy will be by the end of May, if the strict isolation measures continue to hold. To this end, we would like to make a final comment with respect to the basic reproduction number R 0 , the significance and meaning of which are very often misinterpreted and misused, thereby leading to erroneous conclusions. Here, we 325 found an R 0 ∼ 4, which is similar to the values reported by many studies in 19 . CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0    "

As the country and state of NSW begins to open up again, on a backdrop of low disease incidence, mitigating resurgence of COVID-19 and maintaining the hard-won gains is critical.

71546,"The human-infecting corona virus disease (COVID-19) caused by the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was declared a global pandemic on March 11th, 2020. Current human deaths due to the infection have raised the threat globally with only 1 African country free of Virus (Lesotho) as of May 6th, 2020. Different countries have adopted different interventions at different stages of the outbreak, with social distancing being the first option while lock down the preferred option for flattening the curve at the peak of the pandemic. Lock down is aimed at adherence to social distancing, preserve the health system and improve survival. We propose a Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Expected recoveries (SEIR) mathematical model to study the impact of a variety of prevention and control strategies Uganda has applied since the eruption of the pandemic in the country. We analyze the model using available data to find the infection-free, endemic/infection steady states and the basic reproduction number. In addition, a sensitivity analysis done shows that the transmission rate and the rate at which persons acquire the virus, have a positive influence on the basic reproduction number. On other hand the rate of evacuation by rescue ambulance greatly reduces the reproduction number. The results have potential to inform the impact and effect of early strict interventions including lock down in resource limited settings and social distancing"
71564,"The primary aim of this work was to understand why different regions of the world experience the pandemic spread of CoVID-19 in different ways. By recurrent testing of the population, infected individuals can be identified and quarantined, effectively preventing them from spreading the disease any further. It was observed that through increased rates of testing, an increasing percentage of the population could be saved from experiencing CoVID-19 altogether, to a point where if 40% of the population could be tested daily, any disease having a similar reproduction number would not be able to spread at all. This suggests an opportunity for preventing future viral outbreaks if testing can become a routine procedure that responsible members of the population carry out on themselves and self-report. It was also observed that through increased rates of testing, the peak of confirmed cases could be lowered, relieving the toll of an epidemic on the supply chain, and indirectly human wellbeing. It was observed that by de-densification of the susceptible population, the peak count of active confirmed infected cases could be reduced and also delayed, to where the rate of infection of the population was decreased, potentially allowing .

This observation can be an opportunity for actionable advice for urban areas with flexible population densities, such as those with large student populations. By analyzing how Hubei, China, South Korea, Spain, and Iran have experienced the pandemic spread of CoVID-19, it was observed that countries like South Korea, despite having highly dense susceptible populations, can curb the transmission of the disease in the population by high rates of testing. Along similar lines, it was observed that despite having a less dense population, if recurrent testing rates are low, the potential for an unmitigated outbreak is high as is the case in Iran. Rather than seek to prescribe a confident policy recommendation or forecast future spreading of the pandemic based on the limited amount of data available currently, this work aims to offer a model for estimating the current spread of CoVID-19 based on demographic information and chosen policies, and present a tool for visualizing the effect that adjusting the variables of population density and testing rate has on a simulated population in a theoretical system.

71584,"Using a timely and comprehensive dataset, we investigate the effect of city lockdown on air quality in China, which could bring about massive social benefits and partially offset the costs of the COVID-19 epidemic. We find such drastic preventive measures have a significant impact on air quality. We estimated that after its implementation, air quality declined by around 25% (28.2 points for AQI, and 22.3µg/m 3 for PM2.5) relative to the same season in 2019. We also showed that, even in the control cities, where lockdown was not fully implemented, air quality improved (AQI decreased by 8.8 points (7%) and PM2.5 by 8.4 µg/m 3 (8%)). These effects are much larger in more industrialized, richer, and colder cities. The remarkable improvement in air quality could lead to substantial health benefits. Ebenstein et al. (2017) . However, these studies are less relevant to our research contest as they use data at least a decade ago and focus on coarse measures of air pollution, such as total suspended particles (TSP) or PM10. 8 We summarize the related studies in the Appendix Table A8 . We see that quasi-experimental studies find the larger effects on mortality than associational studies.   ()   . . 1101 Based on the previous estimates on the relationship between air pollution and mortality, we show that averted premature deaths per month could be around 24,000 to 36,000, which is an order of magnitude larger than the number of deaths caused directly by COVID-19 in China (WHO, 2020). As air pollution also has significant impacts on morbidity, productivity, and defensive investment, our estimates should be interpreted as the lower-bound of the benefits that can be derived from the air quality improvement. 9 We conclude by pointing out some caveats of this study. First, we only consider the short-term effects of city lockdown. As cities may recover their production after the lockdown, the short-term improvement in air quality could be offset in the longer term. Second, we examine the effect of city shutdown on outdoor air quality and do not account for indoor air quality in our benefit calculation. More people likely spend their time indoor after the lockdown. If indoor air quality is worse than outdoor air quality (e.g., some areas rely heavily on inefficient coal-fired stoves for heating), the beneficial effects from better outdoor air quality could be reduced. Finally, our calculation of the averted number of deaths is not based on actual mortality data, which are not yet available to the researchers. If COVID-19 or city-lockdown affects mortality through other channels, the overall mortality costs could be higher or lower, depending on how different channels are affected. For example, medical resources in many cities run short immediately after the disease outbreak, thus patients could die because they were unable to receive timely and proper treatment (Xie et al., 2020). The counter-virus measures also negatively affected the economy and employment, which are detrimental to population health. In such cases, the excess deaths caused could be larger. In comparison, COVID-19 may have raised individuals' awareness 9 For example, the morbidity cost of air pollution is found to be around two-thirds of mortality costs in China (Barwick et al., 2018) ,   ()   . .1101/2020.03.29.20046649  of their health conditions and made people practice good hygiene. This could significantly reduce deaths from other diseases, particularly influenza. 10 While estimating the overall mortality cost of COVID-19 and city lockdown is beyond the scope of our paper, future research on these issues is warranted to understand the full implications of the COVID-19 pandemic. 10 For example, in Hong Kong, the number of deaths caused by influenza and the number of cases of influenza-like illness reduced by more than 50% in, as compared to previous years: ; in Japan, the influenza-like illness cases in the first week of February were only about 30% compared to the same week a year ago: .

71642,"Summary Background With confirmed cases of COVID-19 declining in many countries, lockdown measures are gradually being lifted. However, even if most social distancing measures are continued, other public health measures will be needed to control the epidemic. Contact tracing either via conventional methods or via mobile app technology is central to control strategies during de-escalation of social distancing. It is therefore essential to identify key factors for a contact tracing strategy (CTS) to be successful. Methods We evaluated the impact of timeliness and completeness in various steps of a CTS using a stochastic mathematical model with explicit time delays between time of infection, symptom onset, diagnosis by testing, and isolation. The model also includes tracing of close contacts (e.g. household members) and casual contacts with different delays and coverages. We computed effective reproduction numbers of a CTS (Rcts) for a population with social distancing measures and various scenarios for isolation of index cases and tracing and quarantine of its contacts. Findings In the best-case scenario (testing and tracing delays of 0 days and tracing coverage of 100%) the effective reproduction number will be reduced with 50% from 1.2 (with social distancing only) to 0.6 (Rcts) by contact tracing. A testing delay of 3 days requires tracing delay or coverage to be at most 1 day or at least 80% to keep Rcts below 1, with the Rcts reduction being 15% and 17%, respectively. With a testing delay of 4 days, even the most efficient CTS cannot reach Rcts values below 1. The effect of minimizing tracing delay (e.g., with app-based technology) declines with declining coverage of app use, but app-based tracing remains more effective than conventional contact tracing even with 20% coverage. The proportion of transmissions per index case that can be prevented depending on testing and tracing delay and isolation of index cases ranges from above 80% in the best-case scenario (testing and tracing delays of 0 days) to 40% and 17% with testing delays of 3 and 5 days, respectively. Interpretation Minimizing testing delay is of key importance for the effectiveness of CTS. Optimizing testing and tracing coverage and minimizing tracing delays, for instance with app-based technology further enhances effectiveness of CTS, with a potential to prevent up to 80% of all transmissions. The process of conventional contact tracing should be reviewed and streamlined, while mobile app technology may offer a tool for gaining speed in the process."
71674,"This work describes the mathematical modelling and dynamics of a novel Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in Kenya. The mathematical model assumes Human-Human infection as well as Human-Pathogen interaction. Using the SEIR (Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered) compartmental model with additional component of the pathogen,we simulated the dynamics of COVID-19 outbreak and impact of different control measures. The resulting system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) are directly solved using a combination of fourth and fifth-order Runge-Kutta methods. Simulation results indicate that non-pharmaceutical measures such as school closure, social distancing and movement restriction emphatically flatten the epidemic peak curve hence leading to a smaller number of overall disease cases."
71718,"Increased testing is seen as one of the most important strategies for combating the COVID-19 pandemic. The positive association between testing and the number of reported cases suggests that more cases will be identified and subsequently isolated with an increase in the number of tests performed. This is in turn will have the effect of slowing down the spread of the virus throughout the population. The objective of this paper has been to assess whether the current level of testing in Bangladesh is sufficient to curb the spread of the virus and to draw comparisons with two important South Asian countries, namely, India and Pakistan.

71728,"We investigate how individual protective behaviors, different levels of testing, and isolation influence the transmission and control of the COVID-19 pandemic. Based on an SEIR-type model incorporating asymptomatic but infectious individuals (40%), we show that the pandemic may be readily controllable through a combination of testing, treatment if necessary, and self-isolation after testing positive (TTI) of symptomatic individuals together with social protection (e.g., facemask use, handwashing). When the basic reproduction number, R0, is 2.4, 65% effective social protection alone (35% of the unprotected transmission) brings the R below 1. Alternatively, 20% effective social protection brings the reproduction number below 1.0 so long as 75% of the symptomatic population is covered by TTI within 12 hours of symptom onset. Even with 20% effective social protection, TTI of 1 in 4 symptomatic individuals can substantially 'flatten the curve' cutting the peak daily incidence in half."
71752,"In this Section present our results with follow up discussions in Subsections 3.1, 3.2 and 3.3. In Subsection 3.1, we investigate different scenarios of contract restrictions and pro-active testing. In these scenarios parameters are not time-dependant:  • Maintaining some degree of contact reduction can make a big difference in case there is a second wave of the pandemic. In practice this might translate to at least avoiding large gatherings. • A delayed lockdown has a considerable impact on the number of infections. A delay of only 20 days can increase the number of spreaders at least twofold. In case there is a second wave of the pandemic, early lockdown is thus a very effective measures, provided there is no means of pro-active testing. In our analyses, we assumed an early lockdown to start about 40 days after the first cases. • If pro-active testing can be employed early, even without any lockdown, the effect of the pandemic can be considerably reduced. This is an important conclusion considering the negative socio-economic effects of a total lockdown. • Ideally early implementation of lockdown and pro-active testing produces the best results in terms of controlling the number of spreaders. Keeping in mind the possibility of a second wave, we must also note that a late lockdown and late pro-active testing might be much less effective than no lockdown and early pro-active testing. This again emphasizes the 18   ()   .   • For strategies that are implemented and maintained indefinitely, there is a chance that the pandemic will relapse, within the year after lifting of a short or long lockdown. • Maintaining a high level of pro-active testing, up to two months after the lockdown is lifted, reduces the risk of the second wave to appear early. This can buy more time to develop a permanent solution such as a vaccine. • Considering the socio-economic impact of a total lockdown, a cyclic pattern of lockdown and release, is a promising strategy. A periodic lockdown, along with a high level of proactive testing maintained two months after the lockdown is aborted, is a feasible measure to control the pandemic, while maintaining a socio-economic balance.

71802,"Although contact rates between symptomatic infectious and susceptible people are likely to influence the proportion of pre-symptomatic transmission, our study highlights substantial potential for pre-symptomatic transmission of COVID-19 in a range of different contexts. Our work suggests that transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is most likely in the day before symptom onset, whereas estimates suggesting most pre-symptomatic transmission highlighted a mean transmission times almost 3 days before symptom onset. These findings highlight the urgent need for extremely rapid and effective case detection, contact tracing and quarantine measures if strict social distancing measures are to be eased. "
71851,"India reported its first COVID19 case on 30 January 2020. Since then the epidemic has taken different trajectories across different geographical locations in the country. This study explores the population aggregated trajectories of COVID19 susceptible, infected and recovered or dead cases in the south Indian state of Telangana with a population of approximately 40 million. Information on cases reported from March 2 to April 4 was collated from government records. The susceptible-infected-removed (SIR) model for the spread of an infectious disease was used. Transmission parameters were extracted from existing literature that has emerged over past weeks from other regions with similar population densities as Telangana. Optimisation algorithms were used to get basic reproduction rate for different phases of nonpharmaceutical interventions rolled by the government. Peak accumulation is projected towards end of July with 36% of the population being infected by August 2020 if the population lockdown or social distancing mechanism is not continued. The number of deaths assuming no intervention is projected to be 488000 (95% CI: (329400, 646600)). A draconian enforcement of population lockdown combined with hand and face hygiene adherence would reduce the transmission by at least 99.7% whereas partial social distancing and hygiene would reduce it by 51.2%. Transmission parameters reported should be interpreted with caution as they are population aggregated and do not consider unique characteristics of susceptibility among micro-clusters and vulnerable individuals. More data will need to be collected to optimize transmission parameters and evaluate the full complexity, to simulate real world scenarios in the models."

Overall, 60.3% of respondents were willing to participate in app-based contact tracing, with 22.5% unsure. Among participants answering 'no', 67.2% stated that this was due to privacy concerns. Worsening mood, fear and anxiety were associated with reduced willingness to participate in app based contact tracing only by univariate analysis (likely due to moderate correlation between these variables by multivariable analysis). Multivariable analysis showed that difficulty in understanding government rules was associated with a decreased inclination to download the app, with those scoring 1-2 and 3-4 in their understanding of the new government rules being 45% and 27% less inclined to download the contact tracing app, respectively, whereas scores of 7-8 and 9-10 showed a 43% and 31% respective increase. Those reporting an unconfirmed belief of having previously had and recovered from COVID-19 were 27% less likely to be willing to download the app. . CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0    Poor understanding of government rules around lockdown and belief of having had COVID-19 decrease willingness to participate in app-based contact tracing. Using the largest patient-facing EHR in the NHS as an effective and timely questionnaire tool, we have revealed the role of uncertainties in both government messaging and not testing suspected COVID-19 infection in reducing willingness for app-based contact tracing and the importance of eliminating uncertainty in lockdown and virus-testing policies. .

71936,"The number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the Rio de Janeiro state, Brazil, are still growing. Based on the data, we considered a SIQR on a fully-connected population in order to study the early evolution of the disease. The initial growth of confirmed cases is exponential, as it is usual, and the parameters of such early epidemic phase were estimated, based on the data. However, as discussed in the text, the Rio de Janeiro state governement implemented isolation policies in March 17, in order to avoid the explosion of cases of COVID-19. The data after the early evolution of COVID-19 exhibits a distinct, nonexponential behavior, i.e., the growth of the number of cases becomes sub-exponential, and the SIQR model can not capture such behavior. In this case, we modified the model to consider isolation procedures in a simple way. The modified model describes well the data, and it allowed us to make a detailed analysis of the evolution of COVID-19 in Rio de Janeiro. Considering the data, we have observed that the initial exponential behavior changed to the sub-exponential one about 7 days after the implementation of social distancing policies (see Fig. 3 ). We found that the isolation policies really work, i.e., the fact of isolate people in home, to avoid social contacts, decreased the growth rate of the number of cases. For the considered parameters, we observed that the number of quarantined individuals grows, stabilizes and after it decays to zero, as it is standard in compartmental models. Based on the data, we can see that the number of such isolated individuals grows until Day 99 from the beginning (March 5, 2020) of the disesase spreading. Thus, the model predicts that the maximum number of quarantined individuals will occur about June 11, 2020. This is in line with a recent estimate [14] . That peak is associated with the isolation of about 0.041% of the Rio de Janeiro state population (about 6, 700 individuals). This number is about 500 times lower than the one predicted by the SIQR model without isolation policies, suggesting the effectiveness of the social isolation. In fact, combining quarantine of individuals tested positive (confirmed cases) with social distance, i.e., multiple interventions, appears to be effective to contain the rapid evolution of confirmed cases seen in the early evolution of the COVID-19 in Rio de Janeiro state. This is in line with a recent work [14] , where the authors analyzed the potential role of nonpharmaceutical interventions in UK and USA. They conclude that the effectiveness of any one intervention in isolation is likely to be . CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0    "
71937,"COVID-19 epidemic is declared as the public health emergency of international concern by the World Health Organisation in the second week of March 2020. This disease originated from China in December 2019 has already caused havoc around the world, including India. The first case in India was reported on 30th January 2020, with the cases crossing 6000 on the day paper was written. Complete lockdown of the nation for 21 days and immediate isolation of infected cases are the proactive steps taken by the authorities. For a better understanding of the evolution of COVID-19 in the country, Susceptible-Infectious-Quarantined-Recovered (SIQR) model is used in this paper. It is predicted that actual infectious population is ten times the reported positive case (quarantined) in the country. Also, a single case can infect 1.5 more individuals of the population. Epidemic doubling time is estimated to be around 4.1 days. All indicators are compared with Brazil and Italy as well. SIQR model has also predicted that India will see the peak with 22,000 active cases during the last week of April followed by reduction in active cases. It may take complete July for India to get over with COVID-19."
71947,"Mandated social distancing has been globally applied to limit the spread of corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) from highly pathogenic severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) -associated coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The benefit of this community-based intervention in limiting COVID-19 has not been proven nor quantified. We examined the effect of timing of mandated social distancing on the rate of COVID-19 in 119 geographic regions derived from 41 states within United States and 78 countries. We found that highest number of new COVID-19 cases per day per million persons was significantly associated with total number of COVID-19 cases per million persons on the day before mandated social distancing (Beta;=0.66, p<0.0001). Our findings suggest that the initiation of mandated social distancing for each doubling in number of existing COVID-19 cases would result in eventual peak with 58% higher number of COVID-19 infections per day. Subgroup analysis on those regions where the highest number of new COVID-19 cases per day have peaked increased Beta to .85 (p<0.0001). We demonstrate that initiating mandated social distancing at a 10 times smaller number of COVID-19 cases will reduce the number of daily new COVID-19 cases at peak by 80% highlighting the importance of this community-based intervention."
71949,"This study analyzes state-level transmission rates of COVID-19 after each state's 500th case, grouping them according to policies implemented prior to their date of 500 cases, in order to determine the efficacy of various social distancing measures. In states that implemented a stayat-home order prior to reaching 500 cases, we observe a significant decrease in the effective viral transmission rate. Subsequent multivariable analyses indicate that this effect may have been driven by a state-wide increase in the amount of time spent at home. We also determine that enacting stay-at-home orders prior to the 500th case significantly increased the time it took to reach 1000 cases but find no association between social distancing policies and deaths or case fatality rate. Reducing COVID-19 spread to alleviate overburdened healthcare systems has become an international priority and understanding the effectiveness of policy interventions is paramount. Disease modeling has indicated that social distancing is a critical measure to achieve this goal, but few studies have validated this finding with emerging case data. Furthermore, few have analyzed epidemiology across states in the country with the largest disease burden, the United States. This study indicates that stay-at-home orders, limitations on mass gatherings, educational facility closures, and non-essential businesses closures are all effective measures at reducing transmission rates thereby flattening the curve. Among these policies, stay-at-home orders had the largest effect, and as states aim to step down from such policies metrics of disease transmission should be carefully monitored to limit recurrent outbreaks. Ultimately, adherence to social distancing appears to be the driving force behind these policies, as states with stay-at-home orders but poor adherence were found to experience similar outcomes to those without such policies. By more rigorously characterizing the state-level strategies that have proved most effective at reducing disease burden, this study aims to provide stakeholders with a more standardized, data-driven framework to guide future policy decisions. .

82975,"The moral decisions we make during this period, such as deciding whether to comply to quarantine rules, have unprecedented societal effects. We simulate the""escape from Milan""that occurred on March 7th-8th, when many travelers moved from a high-risk zone (Milan) to southern regions of Italy (Campania and Lazio) immediately after an imminent lockdown was announced. Our simulations show that as few as 41 active cases reaching Campania (and 52 reaching Lazio) might have caused the sudden spread of the virus observed afterwards in these regions. The surprising influence of the actions of few individuals on societal dynamics challenges our cognitive expectations -- as in normal conditions, few""cheaters""can be easily tolerated. This situation therefore requires novel educational strategies that increase our awareness and understanding of the unprecedented effects of our individual moral decisions."

We see the R 0 for Madhya Pradesh (3.37) , Maharastra (3.25) and Tamil Nadu (3.09) are more than 3. Aggressive intervention is needed. Table 1 : R 0 with a 95% confidence interval for Hubei province and China is around 2.5 during the first 23 days from the starting of the Lockdown. India's R 0 with a 95% confidence interval using two different starting points. One from 02-Mar-2020, because the number of cases in India started rising from that day. The R 0 for India for the first 22 days till the lockdown is around 2.5, like China. However, if we use the data, till 04-Apr-2020, then the R 0 value is around 2.75. In the second approach, we consider India's breakout from 23-Jan-2020. In that situation, if we consider the data till 24-Mar-2020, the R 0 with 95% confidence is almost 1.9 and if we consider data till 04-Apr-2020, the R 0 is nearly 2.1. . We consider the date range for Hubei from 23-Jan-2020 to 14-Feb-2020, i.e., during the first 23 days of Hubei lockdown. On the other hand, we considered the data for India, from the 02-Jan-2020 to 24-Jan-2020, before the lockdown. On the 23-Jan-2020, Hubei had 444 confirmed cases and overall China had 548 confirmed cases. On 02-Jan-2020, India had only 3 confirmed cases, whereas on the day of lockdown, i.e., on 24-Jan-2020, India had 536 confirmed cases. Punjab's high R 0 is likely due to a super spreader ignored advice to self quarantine after returning from a trip to Italy and Germany, see [1] .

83120,"As discussed earlier, the effect of regional lockdown policies on Covid-19 outcomes is heterogeneous, with very few regions effectively using the lockdown policies to contain the spread of the disease. From a policy perspective, we identify here the factors that have contributed jointly to the ineffectiveness of lockdowns, specifically in the three largest regions of Punjab, Sindh, and KPK. The purpose of the paper was to examine the impact of lockdown strategies in different regions ▪ Federal and local governments should involve local religious scholars and community elders in teaching the public the importance of social distancing, hygiene, and prevention. They should also work on dispelling and addressing the stigma around Covid-19 so that people can test themselves without anxiety and fear from society. ▪ Government should allow shorter working hours, limit number of people at religious and social gatherings, and implement universal masking using cloth masks for the community.

83481,"An epidemic carries human and fiscal costs. In the case of imported pandemics, the first-best solution is to restrict national borders to identify and isolate infected individuals. However, when that opportunity is not fully seized and there is no preventative intervention available, second-best options must be chosen. In this article we develop a system of differential equations that simulate both the fiscal and human costs associated to different mitigation measurements. After simulating several scenarios, we conclude that herd immunity (or unleashing the pandemic) is the worst policy in terms of both human and fiscal cost. We found that the second-best policy would be a strict policy (e.g. physical distancing with massive testing) established under the first 20 days after the pandemic, that lowers the probability of infection by 80%. In the case of the US, this strict policy would save more than 239 thousands lives and almost $170.8 billion to taxpayers when compared to the herd immunity case."
83855,"The COVID-19 pandemic led several countries to resort to social distancing, the only known way to slow down the spread of the virus and keep the health system under control. Here we use an individual based model (IBM) to study how the duration, start date and intensity of quarantine affect the height and position of the peak of the infection curve. We show that stochastic effects, inherent to the model dynamics, lead to variable outcomes for the same set of parameters, making it crucial to compute the probability of each result. To simplify the analysis we divide the outcomes in only two categories, that we call {best and worst scenarios. Although long and intense quarantine is the best way to end the epidemic, it is very hard to implement in practice. Here we show that relatively short and intense quarantine periods can also be very effective in flattening the infection curve and even killing the virus, but the likelihood of such outcomes are low. Long quarantines of relatively low intensity, on the other hand, can delay the infection peak and reduce its size considerably with more than 50% probability, being a more effective policy than complete lockdown for short periods."
83918,"Despite the widespread implementation of social distancing measures across the globe to contain the COVID-19 pandemic, its quantitative relationship with the epidemic growth rate has remained an open question. The results of this study indicate that there is a quantitative relationship between the population mobility, measured by the Google Mobility Index (GMI), and the growth rate of COVID-19 infections, namely: the growth rate is a quadratic function of the mobility index. This function was obtained via a regression model trained on publicly available data from 14 countries, and it provides a direct estimate of the important parameters of the epidemic such as the mobility-dependent transmission and mobility-independent recovery rates, as well as the critical mobility. An important finding of this study is that a single function that relates mobility and infection growth fitted on 14 countries achieves high accuracy. Given the significant differences in combination of social distancing measures introduced across these countries, as well as underlying social, demographic and cultural differences, the quality of model fit is very remarkable. The regression model was derived from first principles encoded in an SIR compartmental epidemiological model, which is one of the simplest models that can still generate a dynamic that qualitatively resembles an epidemic such as COVID-19. In fact, thanks to the SIR simplicity and augmenting it by the mild assumptions needed to model the death growth rate, the resulting regression model is easy to interpret, easy to fit, and accurate, thus hitting a sweet spot between modeling simplicity and accuracy. There is a range of extensions of the basic SIR model that can generate more realistic behaviors, such introducing more compartments to model the effects of incubation or stages of an infection, or using heterogeneously mixing populations to account for age-dependent and spatial effects. However, more complex epidemiological models have a larger number of parameters that would necessitate more complex data and result in a less interpretable statistical model. Our study relied exclusively on population mobility as a proxy for changed behavior due to social distancing. Using additional population behavior (such as data about mask usage) and environmental (such as weather) variables would increase the expressive power of our statistical model. However, we are currently not aware of other high quality behavior variables with a global coverage that could have been used in our study. Due to the small size of our data, we reason that environmental time series (although they are publicly available and of good quality) could lead to overfitting of our model. Our results imply that the COVID-19 transmission rate is a quadratic function of the GMI transit mobility. While understanding why is a topic for future research, a quadratic function would arise if we assumed that the population is homogeneous (as is the case in the SIR model) and that the sole impact of social distancing is in reduction of number of contacts between infected and susceptible people (infection probability per each contact does not change). In this case, the transmission rate would scale with the number of contacts, which would scale as the square of population mobility if the fraction of infected people is small. The quadratic relationship implies that while an initial moderate mobility reduction would lead to a sizeable reduction in COVID-19 infection growth rate, any additional mobility reduction would have diminishing returns. Another undesirable implication of the quadratic relationship between population mobility and infection growth rate is that, starting from a given level of reduced population mobility, any increase in mobility will have a much larger negative effect (rapid increase in growth rate) than any decrease in mobility (mild reduction in growth rate). Reversing the growth of an epidemic requires a significant reduction in mobility (critical mobility below 50% of the baseline pre-COVID-19 mobility). To achieve a robust decline in infections and deaths, population mobility would need to go much lower and become comparable to the reductions achieved through strong social distancing measures in Italy, Spain, and France. Overall, our results imply that any attempt to eradicate the epidemic before much of the population gets infected and in the absence of pharmaceutical interventions, would require disciplined, coordinated, and prolonged social distancing. Another option would be to allow a sizeable fraction of the population to get infected, in what case the susceptible ratio = / would be significantly below 1. Because in the SIR model the transmission rate is multiplied by the susceptible ratio when calculating the infection growth rate, this would lead to a reduction in the infection growth rate even if the population mobility is kept constant. It is becoming evident that population mobility reduction due to social distancing is an overwhelmingly costly intervention. Thus, it is of utmost importance to implement less crude NPIs or to combine social distancing with other forms of NPIs. Our results on individual countries indicate that population mobility reduction is not the only effective control mechanism. First, it is evident that baseline COVID-19 growth rate prior to social distancing differed across countries (before social distancing the daily growth rate differed from 14.4% to 25.9%). Moreover, growth rates observed after introduction of social distancing show that mobility reduction did not have the same effect in all countries. Five countries, in particular, were outliers with respect to the learned regression function (Sweden, Canada, Brazil, Mexico, and India) and they might offer useful insights about COVID-19 control. Probably the most important research objective outside of finding a cure or vaccine will be related to precision social distancing: to understand how governments and public health authorities could control or modify select aspects of society and how individual people should fine-tune their behavior in a way that minimally impacts the economy and lifestyles while at the same time curbing or reversing the growth of the epidemic.

84585,"The proposed controller calculates the social distancing level to keep the COVID-19 outbreak controlled. The social distancing level is adjusted to guarantee the fastest way to finish the outbreak with the number of hospitalized individuals below the desired value. This technique can reduce the problems of social distancing and keeps the health care system working. The value of the gains of the proposed controller is chosen by the designer and has the following logic: ψ 1 is related to how fast the error (e(t)) goes to nearby of zero and ψ 2 is related to how softly the error (e(t)) converges to zero. To get a better result when the estimate of the i(t) is used, it will be necessary to improve the quality of the estimator or a better value of the β 0 . The necessary time to finish the social distancing depends on the capacity of the health care system to attend the infected individuals. COVID-19, a contact-transmissible infectious disease, is thought to spread through a population via direct contact between individuals [7] . Models that assess the effectiveness of physical distancing interventions, such as school closure, need to account for social structures and heterogeneities in the mixing of individuals [7, 13] . This work proposed a simple control law to keep the infected individuals during the COVID-19 outbreak below of the desired number. The proposed control law keeps the value of infected individuals controlled only adjusting the social distancing level. The analysis of the stability of the proposed controller was done. In this work, simulation results are presented to show as the control law works. In all simulations, the proposed control law reaches its objectives. It was done simulations of the proposed controller to the standard SIR model. The proposed controller was robust to uncertainties in the basic reproductive number R 0 and disease transmission rate γ. A simulation considering that only the accumulative number of infected individuals is measured was done and the proposed controller kept the number of infected individuals below the upper limit of the desired number of infected individuals. A version of the proposed controller to daily update was developed. This version is too simple that can be calculated in a spreadsheet. This can be considered a good contribution because can easily spread a way to control the COVID-19 outbreak or help in the analysis. To conclude, this work proposes solutions for one of the main research challenges of the analysis and control of epidemics. It proposed a controller that considers uncertainties in the parameters. To the future, a group-structure SIR model will be proposed and the proposed controller will be applied to it. This will be done to develop a decentralized solution and to proposes a more general epidemic model. "
84677,"By reducing the new infection rate, it can be achieved that the number of active infections reaches a maximum and then decreases (the drop in the curve requires a modification of the equation and is therefore not modelled here). iii) The reduction in the new infection rate must be sufficiently strong to lead to a maximum and subsequent decrease in new infections (initially 22.5% or less and then continuously decreasing). iv) The effectiveness of the measures will probably be significantly reflected in the number of new infections at the end of March. v) Falling numbers of actively infected people are (depending on the scenario) not to be expected before the first week of April, but more likely from mid April with several days delay in the US as compared to Germany. vi) The actual development respected up to March 23 2020 leads to simulation results from the simple model presented that a reduction of the infection rate to 20% culminates in a maximum of 350.000 active infections in mid April while a strict reduction to 10% might even stop the active infections at 80.000. vii) In the US an immediate reduction to 20% can stop the registered infections at a maximum of 1.7 million around April 20 th while 300.000 cases are expected when the infection rate can be reduced to 10%. viii) The maximum is run through the later, the higher the new infection rate (between April 3 and April 7 for 12.5% and Germany and US, respectively and April 20 and 27 for 22.5% and Germany and US, respectively, see Fig. 2 and 3) ix) The different course of the new infection rates in the next few days provides information about the success of the school closings and event cancellations as well as the public awareness before the decision to ban the contact (see Fig. 4 ). x) From March 29, the decision to ban contact will also be reflected in the new infection rate and deliver clear information if further steps are necessary xi) It will be clear at the end of March which scenario we can expect and whether the measures taken are sufficient to interrupt the spread (see Fig. 4 ). xii) the decrease in infections after passing through the maximum depends on many other factors which are not adequately described by the model shown. The discussion of the decline in detail is therefore not the subject of the current study. Compared to the literature, this model may seem extremely simplified. However, it turns out that essential statements found in the literature can be reproduced by this simple model (see also [4] ). "
84791,"In our present work, we analyze the observed data of COVID-19 cases in India using the SEIR model. To start with, we used data of COVID-19 from South Korea showing all the phases of active infected cases over time to validate our model. Then, we used the chi-square minimization process to obtain best fitted parameters for South Korea and India. This enabled us to forecast the peak of active infected cases for India. It is found that with respect to the ongoing lockdown situation in India, the peak of active infected cases will occur in Mid of May, 2020 with a maximum number of 43,000. Our study shows that the infected cases will tend to cease by the mid of August, 2020 if lockdown is continued. Interestingly, our predicted peak time is very much consistent with the predictions made by Protiviti, a global consulting firm. In our model, we consider different values of beta (other than for the lockdown condition; β = 0.19) to provide insight on the relative strengths of control measures taken by the government. Lower the value of beta, indicates a relatively better strategy to control the spread. The removal of lockdown on May 3, 2020 may lead to ∼ 21 % increase (corresponding value of transmission rate, β = 0.38) in the peak value of active infected cases as compared to the peak value predicted for ongoing lockdown. This increase is due to the exposed individuals or asymptomatic individuals who may actively transmit in post-lockdown period. Therefore, it is highly important to identify such exposed and asymptomatic individuals in post-lockdown period. Increasing the number of tests for early identification of COVID-19 cases during the lockdown period will certainly help in understanding the real picture of infected volume. Mobile applications or web GIS applications integrated with GPS which are capable of tracking regular geo-spatial movements and health status of individuals can provide useful data [27] . If an individual is found infected, such applications will help to trace the possible spread of disease in the post-lockdown period. Indias bold and timely decision going for a nationwide lockdown of 40 days has certainly helped the country in controlling the infection volume at the cost of adverse socio-economic impact. Whether full or partial lockdown remains after May 3, severely affected zones (states/districts/villages/cities) in the country will significantly contribute to the overall growth of COVID-19 cases in India. Lockdown removal strategies have to be smartly designed which do not allow estimated infected volumes centered around these zones to grow. Model based forecasts of peak values will certainly help decision makers, especially public health and administrative departments of the state and central governments to assess their preparedness, control the pandemic and repair the socio-economic damage caused by the pandemic. Lockdown period is a period not only to control the pandemic but a time bought to re-design the future national and international policies to ensure the sustainable growth of the economy.

85327,"We present results for 10-day ahead forecasts (22 April to 1 May2020) generated for the cumulative number of infected cases and deaths in India as well as in the ten most affected states: Kerala, Maharashtra, Delhi, Gujarat, Tamil Nadu, Telangana, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Karnataka, Rajasthan. In this work, we used two models Holt's method and ARIMA model to forecast the cumulative infected cases and deaths of COVID-19. For the ARIMA model, we forecast per day new infected case(s) and new death(s), whereas for Holt's method cumulative numbers are generated.  The spread of the COVID-19 epidemic has been slow in India as compared to other countries like Italy and the USA. It reflects the influence of the broad spectrum of social distancing measures put in use by the government of India, which has played the role of a barrier to growing infected cases and deaths, apparently helped to slow down the epidemic growth. Our short-term forecast reveals that at the regional level, Delhi, Rajasthan, Gujarat, Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Telangana, and Tamil Nadu will be the most affected states in the coming days. Considering the situation, lockdown should not be lifted in these states. The number of cases in Kerala and Karnataka is found to be reducing. Moreover, these states are shifted from the red zone to blue. Since very little growth in the future is predicted, lockdown may be lifted in these states with some restrictions for the proper functioning of economic activities. While states in green and light green zones, namely, Himachal Pradesh, Goa, Uttrakhand, Bihar, Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh, Odisha, Sikkim, Assam, Arunachal Pradesh, Nagaland, Manipur, Mizoram, Tripura, Meghalaya show very less growth in the infected cases till 1 May, therefore, lockdown may be uplifted there. On India level, there will be around 36335.63 [95% PI(30884.56, 42918.87)] cases and 1099.38 [95% PI(959.77, 1553.76)] deaths up to 1 May 2020. The forecasts presented here are based on the assumption that current mitigation efforts will continue.  "
85510,"The COVID-19 pandemic impacts societies and economies in multiple and dramatic ways. Our findings establish that cancelling public events and enforcing restrictions on private gatherings followed by school closures, which reduce mobility patterns in numerous and dense locations, each with their own particular behavioral norms, have the largest effect on curbing the pandemic in terms of statistical significance and levels of effect. They are followed by workplace and stay-at-home requirements, which also reduce activities away from home and lead to significant reductions in the incidence of COVID-19, which nevertheless are not as large as for public events, private gatherings and school closures, possibly because of the differences in numerosity, density and the ability to trace new infections in these environments. Instead, restrictions on internal movement, public transport closures and international travel controls do not lead to a significant reduction of new infections. The limited impact of travel controls, although imposed relatively early in many countries, is likely explained by their lack of stringency allowing the virus to cross borders. Our econometric framework is suitable for the study of dynamic effects with multiple events, which can be applied in many settings. A natural one is the upcoming exit strategies from the lockdowns, which we will turn to next.  "
85605,"COVID-19 continues to spread across the country and around the world. Current strategies for managing the spread of COVID-19 include social distancing. We present VERA, an interactive AI tool, that first enables users to specify conceptual models of the impact of social distancing on the spread of COVID-19. Then, VERA automatically spawns agent-based simulations from the conceptual models, and, given a data set, automatically fills in the values of the simulation parameters from the data. Next, the user can view the simulation results, and, if needed, revise the simulation parameters and run another experimental trial, or build an alternative conceptual model. We describe the use VERA to develop a SIR model for the spread of COVID-19 and its relationship with healthcare capacity."
85810,"In this paper, we have provided several methodological contributions to Bayesian statistics. First, we have developed a general all-purpose Bayesian model to analyze multiple responses (e.g., continuous, Binomial counts, and Poisson counts). Our approach allows one to directly incorporate their preferred Bayesian model without adjusting the implementation of the preferred model. Second, a composite sampling method to implement a Bayesian model with unknown transformations has been introduced. Third, we developed a general Bayesian analog to the classical comparison between a saturated model and a reduced model. This results in the use of classical residual analysis for assessing goodness-of-fit in Bayesian models for multi-response data. In our simulations, an illustration was given of non-linear functional analysis of multiple response types using BART as the preferred model. Additionally, an illustration was given of a joint spatial analysis of multiple response types using the SME model as the preferred model. These results suggest that the prediction error of our approach is small (in terms of RMSE), and we can develop multi-response versions of several different preferred models seamlessly. Additionally, data driven goodness-of-fit diagnostics were able to lead to the same conclusion as the RMSE criterion that is unobserved in practice. Finally, an illustration was given of a joint multivariate spatio-temporal analysis of zero-inflated continuous responses using the MSTM as the preferred model. Specifically, we analyze records of natural disaster costs in the state of Florida. The ability to accurately forecast the cost of natural disasters may help public policy professionals prepare. There are several considerations for future methodological development. In particular, our choice of the transformation models in Section 2.3 implies that the data are independent. This is true even when the preferred model implies dependence among the transformed data values. Consequently, we are interested in extensions to our model that simultaneously allow for dependence among the data values and dependence among the transformed data values. where f (z, h) = f (z|h) f (h|γ γ γ) f (γ γ γ) dγ γ γ and we have used the assumption of conditional independence between z and (y, θ θ θ ) given h. Then dividing by f (z) = f (z|h) f (h|γ γ γ) f (γ γ γ) dh dγ γ γ yields, which is the desired result. Proof of Proposition 2: Versions of this proof can be found in Diaconis and Ylvisaker (1979) and Bradley et al. (2019a) . The two distributions in (5) associated with j = 2 and j = 3 are members of the natural exponential family (Lehmann and Casella, 1998) , which are of the form, where c i2 = b i and c i3 = 1. Upon multiplying by (6) we have: which proves the result for j = 2 and j = 3. For j = 1, which completes the results. Proposition 3: In Equation (8) we see that which converges to Z i1 as α 1 and κ 1 approach zero. The expectation of a beta distribution is well known (Casella and Berger, 2002) , which from (8) gives us which converges to Z i2 /b i as α 2 and κ 2 approach zero. Similarly, the expectation of a gamma distribution is well known (Casella and Berger, 2002) , which from (8) gives us E {g(h i3 )|Z i3 , γ γ γ} = E(w 3 |Z i1 , γ γ γ) = α 3 + Z i3 κ 3 + 1 , which converges to Z i3 as α 3 and κ 3 approach zero. in (B.1.1).

85814,"We have rehearsed variational procedures for the inversion of a generative model of a viral epidemic-and have extended this model using hierarchical Bayesian inference (parametric empirical Bayes) to deal with the differential responses of each country, in the context of a worldwide pandemic. Clearly, this narrative is entirely conditioned on the generative model used to make these predictions (e.g., the assumption of lasting immunity, which may or may not be true). The narrative is offered in a deliberately definitive fashion to illustrate the effect of resolving uncertainty about what will happen. It has been argued that many deleterious effects of the pandemic are mediated by uncertainty. This is probably true at both a psychological level-in terms of stress and anxiety (Davidson, 1999; McEwen, 2000; Peters et al., 2017 )and at an economic level in terms of 'loss of confidence' and 'uncertainty about markets'. Put simply, the harmful effects of the coronavirus pandemic are not just what will happen but the effects of the uncertainty about what will happen. This is a key motivation behind procedures that quantify uncertainty, above and beyond being able to evaluate the evidence for different hypotheses about what will happen. One aspect of this is reflected in rhetoric such as ""there is no clear exit strategy"". It is reassuring to note that, if one subscribes to the above model, there is a clear exit strategy inherent in the self-organised mitigation 27 afforded by herd immunity. For example, within a week of the peak death rate, there should be sufficient herd immunity to preclude any resurgence of infections in, say, London. The term 'self-organised' is used carefully here. This is because we are part of this process, through the effect of social distancing on our location, contact with infected people and subsequent dissemination of COVID-19. In other words, this formulation does not preclude strategic (e.g., nonpharmacological) interventions; rather, it embraces them as part of the self-organising ensemble dynamics. "
86205,"The COVID-19 outbreak in India is a potential threat to the country due to its rapid spread. Mathematical models are very effective tools to predict the time span and pattern of the outbreak. Moreover, mathematical models can also provide useful insights regarding the impact of intervention in lowering the disease incidence. In this study, we proposed a deterministic compartmental model to describe the disease transmission mechanism among the population. We considered the initial phase of outbreak of the disease COVID-19 in India and fitted our proposed model to the cumulative new reported cases during the period 2 nd March, 2020 to 24 th March, 2020. Some model parameters are estimated by fitting our model to the cumulative new reported cases during the above mentioned period. By looking at the estimated parameters, it is observed that the rate of disease transmission is quite high which basically implies the high infectiousness of the disease. The percentage of the symptomatic individuals coming from exposed individuals is estimated to be more than 52%, whereas the percentage of the asymptomatic and quarantined individuals are estimated as more than 27% and 20% respectively. This indicates that the contribution of the asymptomatic population to COVID-19 cases in India is not negligible. Based on the estimated parameters and actual COVID-19 incidence data, we estimated basic reproduction number, effective reproduction number and epidemic doubling time to get an overview of this initial phase of outbreak. We obtained the estimate of basic reproduction number R 0 as 4.1849 with upper and lower bounds are 4.5014 and 3.8799 respectively. This high value of R 0 basically captures the outbreak scenario in India. The effective reproduction number (R(t)) provides information about the severity of COVID-19 over different time points. In our study, the values of R(t) lie between 2 and 6 most of the time. This is also confirms high transmissibility of the disease. The epidemic doubling time is also estimated to be approximately 3.34 days. This suggests that the rate of disease transmission need to be controlled otherwise a large proportion will be affected within a very short period of time We studied the impact of intervention in reducing the disease burden. We basically considered the preventive measures such as lock-down, spreading of awareness program through media, proper hand sanitization, etc. which slow down the disease transmissibility. Two intervention scenarios are considered depending on the variability of the intervention strength over the period of implementation. In the first scenario, we fixed the strength of the intervention throughout the period of implementation and studied the impact of intervention for different level of intervention efforts. In this scenario, our study reveals that higher intervention effort is required to control the disease outbreak within a shorter period of time. In the second scenario, the whole implementation time are divided into three time windows and in each of the window, the intervention strength is taken to be different. In such a scenario, our analysis shows that the strength of the intervention should not be relaxed over the time rather the intervention should be strengthened to eradicate the disease effectively. Designing the efficient intervention strategy is one of the crucial factor to curb the disease spread in an outbreak situation. In this regard, our study suggests that strict intervention should be implemented by the Government in the subsequent period of this outbreak. We believe that the findings obtained from this study can provide fruitful insights in framing policies regarding the control of COVID-19 in India. "
86363,"The population of migrant worker returning to their home state has significant impact on the expected number of confirmed and confirmed cases. Since lesser number of migrant workers are expected to return to Maharashtra, the rise in confirmed and active cases are predicted to be lower than the states analyzed. As indicated earlier, it may be even lower if the migrant workers leaving a state is considered. The daily arrival rate of migrant workers also affects the rise in confirmed and active cases. In spite of the highest number of migrant workers returning to Uttar Pradesh, maintaining a lower daily arrival rate can help Uttar Pradesh to keep the rise in confirmed and active cases low. The analysis reveals that Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and Madhya Pradesh may experience higher rise in confirmed and active cases after the arrival of migrant workers. However, as indicated earlier, stringent measures in screening migrant workers prior to boarding and strict isolation after arrival can help to keep the rise in confirmed and active cases under control. Some of the state governments have planned for 14 to 21 days quarantine of the arriving migrant workers (Kumar, 2020) . Alternatively, restarting industries with safe work environment might encourage the migrant workers to stay back. The Maharashtra and Karnataka state governments have started allowing a few industries, where migrant workers are generally employed, to operate (Poovanna, 2020) . Such activities would help the migrant workers to earn livelihood and reduce the demand for travel. Moreover, it will help to sustain the economy (Sastry, 2020) . This study observes the implication of the inter-state migrant workers movement on the spread of pandemic COVID-19 at their native states of India. The modified SEIR model provided the additional confirmed and active cases of states analyzed. The daily arrival rate showed significant effect on the rise in the confirmed and active cases. The rise in confirmed and actives cases in states like Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and Madhya Pradesh would be higher than Rajasthan and Maharashtra. The present study is limited to arriving migrant workers only. The migrant workers departing a state, migration of students and other inter-state movements are not considered. "
86427,"This study demonstrated a statistical relationship between two social distancing measures (travel distance and stay-at-home dwell time) and the growth rate of COVID-19 confirmed cases across U.S. states. The statistical variation of the two social distancing measures can be largely explained (with R-squared 0.60∼0.69) by geographic and socioeconomic factors, including state policies, race and ethnicity, population density, age groups, and median household income (see Table S6 -S9 in supplementary materials). Recent studies also identified partisan differences in Americans' response to social distancing guidelines during the COVID-19 pandemic (4). One issue requires attention is that other control measures such as quarantine and enhanced personal protective procedures may also be implemented concurrently and there were no control experiments to compare such effects separately. The predictive modeling results also vary across states and the doubling time is dynamic. All these factors contribute to the endogeneity of findings (17) . Great efforts have been made in scientific research communities on the study of human 6 mobility patterns using various emerging data sources, including anonymized mobile phone call detail records (11, 14, 19, 30, 37) , social media (e.g., Twitter) (16), location-based services and mobile apps (29, 35) . During the COVID-19 pandemic, both individual-level and aggregatedlevel human mobility patterns have been found useful in epidemic modeling and digital contact tracing (5, 10, 22, 32) . However, technical challenges (e.g., location uncertainty), socioeconomic and sampling bias (18, 21, 36, 38) , privacy and ethical concerns are raised by the national and international societies (8, 9, 25, 33) . Moving forward, research efforts will continue in exploring the balance of using such human mobility data for social goods while preserving individual rights. In summary, this study quantifies the effect of social distancing mandates on reducing the spread of COVID-19 when they are followed.  "
86476,"In this study, we attempt to quantify the economic impact of COVID-19 with the nationwide mobility data, including the volumes of visits to venues (V 3 ) of all industrial sectors and the number of newly created venues (NVC), from Baidu Maps. We consider V 3 and NVC as important economic indicators, related to consumption and investment activities, respectively. We then discover the strongly positive correlations between the indicators and the national and provincial GDPs of Mainland China. We further use the drifts of these two indicators during the pandemic, together with the year-to-year changes compared to the past two years (2018 and 2019), to understand the impact of COVID-19 upon Chinese economies. The results show that industrial sectors that are mandatory to human life have recovered faster than the rest of the sectors, while the self-sufficiency of a region might help to avoid the hurt caused by the outbreak, due to being more insulated from, and less impacted by, the decline of global supply chains. "
86782,"We analyze the spread of COVID-19 by considering the transmission of the disease among individuals both within and between regions. A set of regions can be defined as any partition of a population such that travel/social contact within each region far exceeds that between them. COVID-19 can be eliminated if the region-to-region reproductive number---i.e. the average number of other regions to which a single infected region will transmit the virus---is reduced to less than one. We find that this region-to-region reproductive number is proportional to the travel rate between regions and exponential in the length of the time-delay before region-level control measures are imposed. Thus, reductions in travel and the speed with which regions take action play decisive roles in whether COVID-19 is eliminated from a collection of regions. If, on average, infected regions (including those that become re-infected in the future) impose social distancing measures shortly after active spreading begins within them, the number of infected regions, and thus the number of regions in which such measures are required, will exponentially decrease over time. Elimination will in this case be a stable fixed point even after the social distancing measures have been lifted from most of the regions."
86823,"We analyze the effect of using a screening CT-scan for evaluation of potential COVID-19 infections in order to isolate and perform contact tracing based upon a viral pneumonia diagnosis. RT-PCR is then used for continued isolation based upon a COVID diagnosis. Both the low false negative rates and rapid results of CT-scans lead to dramatically reduced transmission. The reduction in cases after 60 days with widespread use of CT-scan screening compared to PCR by itself is as high as $50\times$, and the reduction of effective reproduction rate $R(t)$ is $0.20$. Our results imply that much more rapid extinction of COVID is possible by combining social distancing with CT-scans and contact tracing."
87282,"""All models are wrong, but some are useful"". This famous statement, attributed to the statistician George Box, sums up the usefulness of our model. Although it is not possible to predict the exact number of infected individuals, the model allows describing, in a qualitative way, the influence that different measures can have to mitigate the spreading of the coronavirus during a competition. Based on the simulations carried out with the epidemiological parameters estimated by the scientific community, the results of the study can be summarised in five points: • Reducing the days between matches reduces the risk of spreading COVID-19 throughout the season. The more the season is compressed, the less risk of contagion. • PCR tests should be performed on all football players participating in the competition. Antibody and antigen tests should be ruled out in this context because they are less reliable and are not effective until the disease is well advanced. • The tests should be carried out continuously along with the competition, with the optimum scenario being one test per day. • The player's environment is essential to avoid introducing the disease into the system. It is necessary that the players try to limit their social contacts as much as possible, and that their physical interaction with the technical staff is as distant as possible. • The process is highly unpredictable. While qualitative results are clear, obtaining precise predictions for a single realisation (the real case) is not possible. This is in agreement with recent work that warns about the strong sensitivity to parameter values in epidemics modelling [24] . We must also note that applying all the measures suggested by the model involves a cost. On the one hand, reducing the time between matches can be very physically demanding. The recovery time after a match would be reduced and the risk of injury would increase. To reduce this risk, teams should increase player rotations. Regarding the tests, football clubs should provide the necessary support and means to carry out such a high number of tests in such a short time. Without an adequate policy in this regard, the risk of reinfection in a competition would skyrocket. Players will also pay a personal cost to control the eventual spreading of coronavirus. Minimising their contacts with other individuals would mean limiting their travels, public events and, in general, reducing interactions with people outside the family environment. In fact, maintaining them in confinement during the rest of the season would be obviously the optimum situation. Finally, although the results shown here are focused on the resumption of the men's Spanish national league, the conclusions are equally valid for the women's competition. Furthermore, the model could be adapted to any competition in which matches involve some physical contact between players, such as basketball, handball or rugby. "
87350,"In order to analyze the effectiveness of three successive nationwide lockdown enforced in India, we present a data-driven analysis of four key parameters, reducing the transmission rate, restraining the growth rate, flattening the epidemic curve and improving the health care system. These were quantified by the consideration of four different metrics, namely, reproduction rate, growth rate, doubling time and death to recovery ratio. The incidence data of the COVID-19 (during the period of 2nd March 2020 to 31st May 2020) outbreak in India was analyzed for the best fit to the epidemic curve, making use of the exponential growth, the maximum likelihood estimation, sequential Bayesian method and estimation of time-dependent reproduction. The best fit (based on the data considered) was for the time-dependent approach. Accordingly, this approach was used to assess the impact on the effective reproduction rate. The period of pre-lockdown to the end of lockdown 3, saw a $45\%$ reduction in the rate of effective reproduction rate. During the same period the growth rate reduced from $393\%$ during the pre-lockdown to $33\%$ after lockdown 3, accompanied by the average doubling time increasing form $4$-$6$ days to $12$-$14$ days. Finally, the death-to-recovery ratio dropped from $0.28$ (pre-lockdown) to $0.08$ after lockdown 3. In conclusion, all the four metrics considered to assess the effectiveness of the lockdown, exhibited significant favourable changes, from the pre-lockdown period to the end of lockdown 3. Analysis of the data in the post-lockdown period with these metrics will provide greater clarity with regards to the extent of the success of the lockdown."
87391,"We present below the simulation results of the model proposed, discuss the analysis and provide possible prediction of the Covid-19 pandemic in India and few states which are affected seriously. In population dynamics, one can express V as , V = N N/V = N D ; where, N is the total population in the geographical area, and D is the population density. Taking N as constant, we can correlate the change in V as change in the D by, V ∝ 1 D . We have studied the stochastic SEQIR model in the context of Covid-19 disease dynamics in India and its five comparatively worse affected states using stochastic methods. Our numerical simulation results show that policies like social distancing and quarantine have important roles in controlling the disease outbreak and we propose to optimize these two parameters to effectively intervene in the disease transmission. An important consequence of employing a stochastic method is the importance of demographic fluctuations, which are quite visible in the simulation results, to affect the disease dynamics and even in intervening the disease spread. This demographic stochasticity is generally neglected in its deterministic counterpart which is quite important in regulating any system dynamics. Hence, our stochastic simulation method could capture the demographic stochasticity which is non-negligible. We would like to mention that we do not intend to give quantitative predictions here. One limitation of the model under consideration is that by construction, populations from S and E compartments make transitions to the Q compartment where they are assumed to interact homogeneously. This may give rise to a more infected population and we do not see the trends of I(t) converging near zero over relatively less 300 days in our simulation. This also points out that policies such as social distancing and quarantine of the exposed population are not sufficient enough to end the COVID-19 disease outbreak. Other policies like complete lockdown and more testing of susceptible populations should be considered and must be incorporated systematically in mathematical models.  "
87634,"Sweden has adopted far less restrictive social distancing policies than most countries following the COVID-19 pandemic. This paper uses data on all mobile phone users, from one major Swedish mobile phone network, to examine the impact of the Coronavirus outbreak under the Swedish mild recommendations and restrictions regime on individual mobility and if changes in geographical mobility vary over different socio-economic strata. Having access to data for January-March in both 2019 and 2020 enables the estimation of causal effects of the COVID-19 outbreak by adopting a Difference-in-Differences research design. The paper reaches four main conclusions: (i) The daytime population in residential areas increased significantly (64 percent average increase); (ii) The daytime presence in industrial and commercial areas decreased significantly (33 percent average decrease); (iii) The distance individuals move from their homes during a day was substantially reduced (38 percent decrease in the maximum distance moved and 36 percent increase in share of individuals who move less than one kilometer from home); (iv) Similar reductions in mobility were found for residents in areas with different socioeconomic and demographic characteristics. These results show that mild government policies can compel people to adopt social distancing behavior."
88482,"We have established in this brief note that the studies of mathematical models of disease spreading, such as the one in [1] , typically have very limited ability to make numerical predictions. Such models, if analyzed properly, could play an important role in our qualitative understanding of disease evolution and, with some effort, perhaps in making short term predictions. Unfortunately, completely absurd claims sometimes attract a lot of public attention and run the risk of leading to wrong policy decisions. While there are many such examples in the recent literature, we have focused here on analyzing one specific model study [1] . This paper is technically correct in that they state their assumptions clearly and the stated results are obtained under these assumptions. However,  "
88586,"We present a very simple and transparent method to interpret time series of confirmed Covid-19 cases. Roughly speaking, the analysis of weekly new infections for each day is a tool for the definition and early detection of the turning point of the epidemic. In Italy, the growth of Covid-19 activity was overcome one week ago, Austria and Switzerland followed suit. This note emphasizes the crucial delay of two weeks between infection and listing of infection in a central database. Our estimates of the time course of Covid-19 activity and reproduction rates can reduce the information gap by several days. We show that Spain and Germany are already beyond the turning point. In general the estimated reproduction rates become undercritical a short time after the main lockdown measures, and the Covid-19 activity starts to decrease afterwards. This note gives a very optimistic outlook for all regions which have taken strict containment measures."
88803,"Given the rapid spread of COVID-19 across the globe and countries imposing severe lockdown measures to fight the virus. It has become essential to come up with a balance between cost imposed by the pandemic to the economy and the number of infections so that medical facilities are not overwhelmed. Over the basic SEIR model, we have considered interstate movement of population and have built a strategy to obtain optimal policy solutions. We have also modelled the fraction of population that willingly follows social distancing despite no government imposed lockdowns which makes the model coherent with COVID-19 situation. The optimal policy solution was generated by using the NSGA-II which offers a possible solution involving partial lockdown varying with time and place on the basis of infected population and cost incurred.  "
89420,"A methodology based in the application of the logistic map in different phases of the covid-19 epidemic was applied. This methodology provided good results in forecasting the evolution of the disease in every country where it was applied. As still there is a long way to discover a vaccine to the SARS-CoV-2 or a cure of the associated disease covid-19, the only way of reducing the consequences of the epidemic is the optimum application of NPI. The use of non-pharmaceutical countermeasures, as the total lockdown, showed their effectiveness during the period they were applied. However, easing the countermeasures will allow new outbreaks of the infection to appear. This situation forces the need of applying many simultaneous techniques to reduce the effect of the disease. One of those could be the application of the methodology described in this paper to provide early alert of those outbreaks in small units of population, allowing an optimization of sanitary resources and reducing the effect of future NPI if applied locally. The aim of any policy of applying the NPI, or after easing their application, should be looking for daily infection rates of the range of 1.01 to 1.02 (1% to 2%), which, as shown in countries like South Korea, would provide acceptable levels of people needing care in hospitals or dying. And the more important, it makes almost impossible to reach to saturation levels of national healthcare systems. A forecast for the next month on the number of diagnosed infected cases and deaths in Spain was presented, providing a number of deaths in Spain of 46,000 ± 15,000. These numbers, and also the number of diagnosed infected, can be altered due to new statistical methods, as including deaths at home, or the performance of a bigger number of tests in the non-symptomatic population. As this epidemic is still ongoing many situations would alter the predictions here presented. The discovery of a vaccine for the virus or a cure of the associated disease will deeply change the numbers. Changes in the weather will demonstrate the seasonality of the disease, but then new outbreaks will be expected for the season after the summer. A continuous watch of the disease is needed to provide adequate forecasting which can be used by policy makers. "
89621,"The model suggestion that containment can be achieved if contact tracing is combined with an early implementation of social distancing is in line with the examples of South Korea, Japan, and Taiwan, where despite differences in contact tracing strategies (mobile phone data was used in South Korea but not in Japan), the common denominator of these cases is a high acceptance rate and immediate implementation of SD measures such as wearing masks. In contrast to many European states, these countries did not have to resort to full scale lock downs. The longer term benefit of a lock down has been debated recently and for overwhelmingly large numbers of weak symptom carriers, lifting the lock down would indeed result in an immediate second outbreak as suggested by [18] . If however the disease is only moderately above the epidemic transition threshold (see estimates for COVID-19 parameters in Fig. 2 (b) ), a lock down effectively acts as a reset shifting time to a stage before contact tracing is overwhelmed (i.e. to the left of the discontinuity in Fig. 5 (b) ). Under such conditions, a subsequent combination of contact tracing and social distancing can keep the situation under control. The persistently low infection numbers in Hubei province as well as in countries like Austria and Germany where the lock down has been lifted more recently, indicate that COVID-19 may fall into this latter parameter regime. Although the parameters of COVID-19 such as transmission rates and the percentage and role of weak-symptom carriers are still under debate, even for conservative estimates and with highly efficient contact tracing, including complete removal of local clusters, immediate quarantining and unlimited testing in place, our models predict that containment fails. Nevertheless, testing is highly effective in limiting the spread, but under realistic conditions it will quickly reach its capacity limit. If additional social distancing measures are implemented before this happens the outbreak is contained, however if the implementation is just marginally late the identical combination of measures fails. "
89643,"In questo report sono stati presentati i risultati iniziali di una indagine sull'uso e la diffusione degli #hashtag da parte delle istituzioni culturali italiane, durante la Fase 1, quella con restrizioni maggiori alla mobilità dei cittadini, del periodo di lockdown dovuto all'epidemia di COVID-19 nel 2020. L'analisi quantitativa ha mostrato dei dati interessanti in termini sia di comunicazione dalle istituzioni verso il pubblico sia delle risposte e dell'interazione degli utenti. Il fenomeno del moltiplicarsi di #hashtag e tweet, a corredo delle numerose iniziative intraprese in risposta all'evento pandemico, è indicativo della velocità e della proattività con cui le istituzioni, in particolare i musei, hanno reagito. Tale atteggiamento da parte delle istituzioni culturali, come emerge anche dalla prima indagine NEMO, condotta dopo tre settimane dall'inizio del periodo di lockdown, ha contribuito a ridurre lo stato di isolamento e solitudine aumentando i servizi digitali per incoraggiare le persone a rispettare la politica di restrizioni. Inoltre, queste iniziative hanno stimolato un senso di fiducia e comunità attraverso le richieste rivolte agli utenti per la condivisione di oggetti, storie e immagini al fine di creare una memoria collettiva di tale periodo. Infine, le istituzioni hanno dimostrato di poter sostenere il ruolo di educatori informali pure operando a distanza attraverso la proposta di quiz, giochi e materiali educativi fruibili online. Dal canto loro, gli utenti hanno risposto in maniera positiva a tali iniziative, incrementando drasticamente il numero di interazioni su e con le istituzioni e dimostrando uno spiccato interesse ad una partecipazione attiva nella creazione e trasmissione di contenuti culturali. Gli #hashtag, scelti come caso di studio per questa analisi, hanno permesso di ricostruire gran parte delle iniziative che le istituzioni hanno lanciato a livello mondiale e nazionale; di monitorarne il successo nel corso dei mesi di marzo, aprile e per i primi giorni di maggio; di individuare tra gli utenti che hanno risposto all'invito a partecipare le istituzioni più attive sui social network e, infine, di essere classificati per aree tematiche a seconda della loro morfologia. Ulteriori linee di indagine si prospettano a partire dalla prima analisi esplorativa, in particolare per quanto riguarda la possibilità di analisi linguistiche volte a stabilire il tipo di contenuti veicolati e l'atteggiamento degli utenti, in termini di sentiment e sensitivity ai beni culturali, rispetto alle iniziative e alle informazioni fornite dalle istituzioni in questo periodo. Figura 1 -Andamento del numero di interazioni associati agli #hashtag per l'intero periodo di lockdown 29 Nasce contemporaneamente all' #hashtag #ArTyouReady. 30 La data di lancio, che è al di fuori del periodo di lockdown che è stato preso in considerazione in questo report, si spiega con la decisione della regione Lombardia di chiudere musei, biblioteche e altri luoghi pubblici di aggregazione, in anticipo rispetto al resto d'Italia, per contenere la diffusione del virus che ha colpito quella zona prima di diffondersi in tutta la Penisola  li-per-bar-e-locali-ecco-lordinanza-completa-della-regione-lombardia.html 31 Sebbene la data di lancio preceda di un giorno la pubblicazione del DPCM 8 marzo che sancisce la chiusura dei musei, l'iniziativa rientra nel piano di comunicazione adottato da ICOM Italia a sostegno dei Musei al tempo del COVID-19   "
89767,"Following the initial COVID-19 outbreak in Northern Italy, the Italian government, as many other governments around the world, adopted increasingly stricter lockdown measures at the national level to mitigate the epidemic. Despite their success, their tolling economic costs have stirred a hot national debate on whether such measures were necessary in the first place and on how to relax them while avoiding future epidemic waves. Several attempts have been made in the literature at addressing this pressing open issues by means of aggregate models (originated from the classical SIR model) to describe the effects of different intervention strategies at the national level 6, 7 . A network model has also been recently proposed to describe the spatial dynamics of the spread of the COVID-19 epidemics among the 107 Italian provinces 14 . Other works in the literature have explored the effects of intermittent measures, either periodic or as a function of some observable quantities, as a viable alternative to long, continuous periods of national lockdown. However, the effects of these strategies have only been investigated on theoretical aggregate models at the national level 7, 22 . An important missing aspect that we considered in our study is the effect of regional heterogeneity on the efficacy of the measures taken so far and the possibility of adopting differentiated and localized intervention strategies thanks to the pseudo-federalist administrative structure of the Italian Republic. Our results confirm the effectiveness at the regional level of the national lockdown measures taken so far. They also convincingly reveal the presence of important regional effects due, for example, to the saturation of regional healthcare systems or to the presence of notable North-South flows in the country that followed the announcement of national measures. Also, contrary to previous work, we explicitly accounted for the strongly nonlinear nature of the model and the uncertainty present in the data by performing a sensitivity analysis on the estimated parameters that further confirmed the robustness of the proposed strategies for a wide range of parameter changes Our study strongly suggests for policy-and decision-makers the potential benefits of differentiated (but coordinated) feedback regional interventions, which can be used independently or in combination with other measures, in order to avoid future epidemic waves or even to contain the outbreak of potential future epidemics. Despite having been focused on Italy, our methodology and modeling approach can be easily extended to other levels of granularity, e.g. countries in a continent or counties in a state, and adapted to any other nation where regional heterogeneity is important and cannot be neglected; notable examples are countries with a federal state organization such as Germany or the United States of America. Future work needs to address further aspects as for example exploring how the structural properties of the inter-regional network can influence the dynamics of the epidemic or adopting more sophisticated cost functions to design more effective region-specific mitigation strategies in other contexts or for other purposes. "
89885,"The effect of unprecedented policy measure adopted by the Union Government of India for 'complete lockdown' of the entire country to contain the spread of COVID-19 has been analyzed scientifically with the help of a kinetic model. Extreme care were taken to choose large number of parameters from multitude of sources to reflect the prevailing ground realities in India. It was aimed to accurately represent state wise information in a statistical sense. The primary purpose of the present study is to compare the likely spread of COVID-19 in two different scenarios: (i) with complete lockdown in place from 25 th March, 2020 as it happened and, (ii) without any lockdown imposed. The simulation were run for 60 days starting from 20 th March, 2020, considered as the zeroth day. The simulation results conclusively shows that, in the first scenario, only a tiny fraction of population (less than 4%) are exposed to high risk category while in the second scenario more than 40% of population are exposed to high risk category. The difference is significant and therefore our detailed simulations very conclusively support the great efficacy of 'complete lockdown' as an effective tool for keeping the COVID-19 infection within a tolerable limit. This is an extremely important policy success for fighting COVID-19 disease in the absence of any preventive measures, such as a vaccine or any definitive drug for curing it. "
90293,"The main objective of this study is to explore the relationship among the number of infected cases, exchange rate and stock market in India and to analyse the correlation among the growth rate series of these three variables. Since October 07, 2019 to March 10, 2020, average exchange rate of USD to INR was at 71.44 but after march 11, when the COVID-19 has been declared to be Pandemic by WHO, the average exchange rate over the period considered became 75.72. We observed a generally positive correlation between the growth rate of infected cases and the growth rate of exchange rate. This correlation was found to be negative between the growth rate of infected cases and the growth rate of Sensex. The VAR results implied that the increase in the confirmed COVID-19 cases caused suggestive but not statistically significant changes in the values of the exchange rate and Sensex, and that due to the COVID-19 shock, the growth rate of Sensex and the growth rate of exchange rates would have taken a substantial number of days, in general, to return to their long-run growth trends. The decision of lockdown appears to be effective in controlling the spread of COVID-19 reflected by the average daily growth rate of confirmed cases and death cases. The daily average growth rate of confirmed cases was 17.804% before the lockdown which changes first to 15.684% in first phase of lockdown and then to 7.55% when the lockdown is extended. Similarly, the growth rate of deaths was 23.55% before the lockdown which first falls to 19.39% in first phase of lockdown and again to 7.27% when it is extended after April 15. These are indications that the lockdown improved the situation to some extent. The average growth rate of exchange rate and Sensex were 0.06% and -0.17% respectively over the entire period considered in this study. During the first phase of lockdown growth rate of exchange rate is 0.013% which is lower than the daily average growth rate of exchange rate observed before lockdown. With the extension of lockdown, the daily growth rate of exchange rate becomes -0.04% (INR being appreciated) after April 15. During lockdown 1.0, there is a positive correlation between GROWTHC and GEX, but a negative correlation between GROWTHC and GSENSEX. This meant that with the rise in the growth rate of the number of confirmed cases, the Indian currency continued depreciating, whereas the stock exchange index started to fall. Also, there is a strong negative correlation between the exchange rate and the Sensex index, implying that with the Indian currency depreciating the stock exchange also dropped. With extension of the lockdown, clear variabilities were observed in the relationships across the variables of interest. We found a high degree of negative correlation between GROWTHC and GEX, but the negative correlation between GROWTHC and GSENSEX was almost washed out. Under the combined lockdown period, from March 25 to April 27, a positive correlation between GrowthC and Gex and a negative correlation between GrowthC and Gsensex were observed which means that INR is being depreciated with rising growth rate of confirmed cases. Our investigations into the relations and interdependence between economic and health variables in context of the pandemic and the lockdown identify strong evidences of variability in these relationships over time. It is quite evident that these changes are extremely dynamic, and nuanced observation at the rapidly-changing scenario is required for effective policy decisions. Our framework is quite flexible and quick updating of the results is possible based on new incoming data, which is why it can potentially be useful in identifying the current needs from a decision-making perspective.  "
90377,"We propose a simple SEIR-type model (SEIRQ), which includes the effects of testing and contact tracing. The model formulation allows to calculate an interpretable formula for the reproductive number R (2.2). As typical for this class of models, R depends on transmission parameters β. Increasing β corresponding in e.g. to higher frequency of social contacts increases R. Decreasing β, for example in consequence of widespread use of face masks, has the opposite effect. On the other hand γ d reflects the time to diagnosis and the formula indicates that more rapid diagnosis is associated with lower R. In addition, our model offers a clear interpretation of the quarantine effect. The transmission rate due to diagnosed cases, β d , is decreased by the factor θαγ d indicating that both the number of quarantined per diagnosed individual (α) and proper targeting of the quarantine (the infection rate among the quarantined θ) equally contribute to this factor. Also the parameter related to testing: the delay in diagnosis, γ −1 d , plays similar role. This quantifies the potential of a wide range of interventions to improve testing and contact tracing, as outlined in e.g. in ECDC recommendations [31] . In particular, as the number of people put in quarantine per each case and the infection rate among the quarantined impact R in similar fashion, our results support the recommendations to focus on the high risk contacts when the resources do not allow to follow all contacts. Our model takes into consideration only the effective contact tracing, i.e. the situation when the infected contacts are identified and put in quarantine before they become infectious. People who are identified later would be modelled as passing through one of the I states to the R states. This means that the number of quarantined in our model can be also increased by faster contact tracing. The timely identification of contacts may be a significant challenge in the quarantine approach given that the incubation time can be as short as 2 days in 25% of cases [3] . As mentioned by other Authors [28] , the delays in manual contact tracing are usually at least 3 days and under such circumstances the contact tracing and quarantine alone may be insufficient to control the epidemic. This could be improved with digital contact tracing. Notably, mixed contact tracing strategies implemented in South Korea indeed helped to control the epidemic at the early stages [32] . The use of ""smart contact tracing"" with mobile phone location data and administrative databases were also key to rapid identification and self-quarantine of contacts in Taiwan [33] and implementation of such strategy helped Singapore to control the epidemic without major disruptions of social activities [34] . We note that the quarantine effect relates only to transmission due to diagnosed cases. As expected, in order to control the epidemic the transmission due to undiagnosed cases has to be negligible. This can be controlled by general measures such as lockdown, which universally decrease the frequency of social contacts and are therefore likely to reduce β u . In our model the part of R representing transmission due to undiagnosed cases is scaled by (1 − κ) , the parameter relating to the efficiency of the testing system. Again, the examples of Singapore as well as the Italian village of Vo'Euganeo show that the widespread testing complementing the efficient contact tracing was essential to suppress epidemic. Testing unrelated to epidemiological links decreases (1 − κ) factor, thus making the factors impacting transmission due to diagnosed cases, such as quarantine, more powerful to decrease R. Further, our model allows to study the effect of the situation, in which the contact tracing capacities are exceeded. In this situation the epidemic is likely to quickly develop to the levels observed without quarantine. It is therefore quite crucial to implement the aggressive contact tracing system, when the epidemic is still at low levels and it is possible to bring the epidemic to suppression phase. We demonstrate the high impact of contact tracing and quarantine on the observed numbers of cases in Poland. This effect was coupled with substantial reduction in the transmission parameter β resulting from social contact restrictions. Depending on the scenario, β decreased by 76% to 84%, bringing R below 1. The estimated effect of the quarantine in Poland would depend on which of the considered scenarios regarding testing efficiency was the most relevant to our situation. In our model the quarantine is estimated to be the most effective for the scenario in which most of the cases are diagnosed (κ = 0.8). Testing strategies that comprise testing of all individuals with symptoms of respiratory illness could theoretically identify up to 82% of infected, assuming they would all present to medical care. This could be coupled with random screening of high risk individuals, in e.g. health care workers, or -in case of high incidence -even random screening of entire community to achieve the κ of the order of 0.8. The Polish clinical recommendations specifically mention only testing all individuals with severe infections [35] . In addition testing is provided to health care workers. The severe course corresponds to approximately 18% of all infections [3] . Therefore, the κ = 0.8 scenario is unlikely to be realistic in Poland. We believe that the plausible current κ in our country lies between 0.2 and 0.5. For these scenarios the model shows that the control of the epidemic is largely achieved through suppression of β. In case of relaxation of social contact restrictions, the efforts should be focused on increasing the level of testing in order to decrease the proportion of undiagnosed cases as well as maintaining or increasing the effectiveness of quarantine. For smaller κ, even substantially increasing the effectiveness of quarantine does not allow to go back to the level of social contacts from before the epidemic (β 1 ). Finally, the contact tracing effort was manageable in Poland due to relatively small number of cases. Should the case load increase substantially longer delays in contact tracing would occur, which can substantially decrease the effects of quarantine [27, 28] . Limitations and future directions of research. We do not consider the likely reduced transmission from undiagnosed cases who are more likely to be asymptomatic or paucisymtopmatic cases (β u < β d ). The reduction factor for infectiousness of asymptomatic is still under investigation. One study found a 60-fold lower viral loads in asymptomatic cases [29] , but another estimated the transmissibility reduction by 50% [6] . Moreover, we did not have sufficient data to include this additional parameter. We calibrated our model only to diagnosed cases, which were officially available. Calibration to mortality data is another approach successfully implemented in e.g. [25] that potentially removes bias due to different testing policies. As there were relatively fewer fatalities in Poland and little data on clinical progression we decided on simplified model without explicit modelling of the outcomes. Furthermore, we did not consider the sub-optimal adherence to quarantine. It is likely that some individuals would not fully comply to strict quarantine rules. However, only anecdotal evidence for such phenomenon is available at this time. In our model it would decrease the effective αθ, which was chosen to fit to observed number of people put in quarantine. Finally, the analysis of R is suitable for small size of epidemic, when S ≈ N . For other cases the results are still useful, but the approximation may be biased, as we have shown for β * . Due to little available data and policy changes we did not have sufficient data to determine which κ scenario is the most appropriate. In conclusion we present a simple model, which allows to understand the effects of testing, contact tracing and quarantining of the contacts. We apply the model to the data in Poland and we show that despite a substantial impact of contact tracing and quarantine, it is unlikely that the control of the epidemic could be achieved without any reduction of social contacts.

90457,"China's policy interventions to reduce the spread of the coronavirus disease 2019 have environmental and economic impacts. Tropospheric nitrogen dioxide indicates economic activities, as nitrogen dioxide is primarily emitted from fossil fuel consumption. Satellite measurements show a 48% drop in tropospheric nitrogen dioxide vertical column densities from the 20 days averaged before the 2020 Lunar New Year to the 20 days averaged after. This is 20% larger than that from recent years. We relate to this reduction to two of the government's actions: the announcement of the first report in each province and the date of a province's lockdown. Both actions are associated with nearly the same magnitude of reductions. Our analysis offers insights into the unintended environmental and economic consequences through reduced economic activities."
90662,"In the paper we present an SEIR model with Asymptomatic and Quarantined compartments to describe the recent and ongoing COVID-19 outbreak. Our model is intended to highlight the strength of three different non-pharmaceutical interventions imposed by public policies in containing the outbreak and the total number of disease-induced infections and deaths: -reduction of contact rate for a given portion of the population; -enforced quarantine for confirmed infectious individuals; -testing among the population to detect also asymptomatic infectious individuals. On one hand we show that, as expected, each of these interventions has a beneficial impact on flattening the curve of the outbreak. On the other hand, the comparison among different scenarios shows the remarkable efficacy of an early massive testing approach, when the limited number of infected individuals makes easier and more effective the tracing of recent contacts of the individual, as in Scenario D 1 , and of a timely lockdown, although in the presence of few confirmed infected cases, as in Scenario C 1 . In both situations, the timing of the intervention plays a crucial role on the incisiveness of the public safety policy. In addition, we give an explicit representation of the basic reproduction number in terms of the several parameters of the model, which allows to describe its dependence on the features of the virus and on the implemented non-pharmaceutical interventions. This description makes available a valuable tool to tune the public policies in order to control the outbreak of the epidemic, forcing R 0 below the threshold 1. However, considering the major effects of an enduring lockdown on the economy of the country that applies it, it is desirable to loosen the lockdown measures after the containment of the outbreak. Nevertheless, the decision makers and each individual shall be aware that a value of R 0 only barely greater than 1 would lead to an increase in the number of infected and dead by an order 2 of magnitude, thus provoking the collapse of the relative national health system. This is better explained by the following scenarios: consider a situation with constant testing ρ = 0.05 and no lockdown where, after the first 35 days of outbreak with a high R 0 (≈ 2), the population gains awareness of the risk and manage to reduce its contact rate so as to steer R 0 to either 0.9, 1 or 1.1. Figure 9 illustrates the large deviations among the outcome of these three different situations. In order to allow the population to circulate with no restrictions, it is necessary that herd immunity (see Remark 3.4) is achieved. The value that matters to compute this threshold of immunization is the basic reproduction number under no social distancing, which has been estimated in this article and in many others as being, in general, greater than 2.5. So achieving herd immunity would imply to infect at least 60% of the population, which would lead, with the current mortality rates, to 1-5% of the population dying, which is, obviously, a catastrophic unwanted situation. Hence, reinforcing what was said in the above paragraph, until a vaccine or treatment is not found, it is necessary to maintain the value of R 0 below 1. Otherwise, the curve of infections will always be increasing. "
91474,"In agreement with foregoing studies [5, 13, 18, 20] , our results indicate that social distancing has limited the spread of COVID-19. Many U.S. counties with large reductions in mobility achieve near-zero fever incidences by early April, indicating that severe curtailment of mobility is effective in reducing disease transmission. Some counties in Midwestern states, however, achieve similar outcomes with more moderate mobility reductions, and New York City has only partially reduced fevers despite strong decreases in mobility. These counter-examples highlight that regional disparities in demographics, climate, or the delay before implementing mobility restrictions are also potentially of first-order importance for explaining and predicting the spread of COVID-19. The corollary to social distancing being effective is the question of the optimal degree of mobility restriction for purposes of controlling the spread of COVID-19. Foregoing studies have generally drawn inferences from confirmed case statistics [5, 13, 18, 20] , but these lag actual infections by up to several weeks and are subject to heterogeneous and potentially biased reporting, making it challenging to infer causality in case growth rates and possibly allowing outbreaks to spread through communities before a response can be mounted. Our combining cellphone mobility insights with smart-thermometer fever data permits for more rapidly assessing the timing and rates of change in illness incidence. By leveraging existing data sources for disease surveillance, approaches like the one we have employed may enable timely monitoring of the effectiveness of mobility restrictions and, thereby, support efforts to contain emerging outbreaks [8] . The importance of such capabilities is underscored by the possibility that COVID-19 outbreaks will recur seasonally and require prolonged or intermittent social distancing [16] . Figure 1 : Variations in mobility, fever incidence, and confirmed COVID-19 cases for an example county in each of 45 U.S. states. Each panel shows a mobility index (green), the estimated percentage of individuals experiencing fevers (black), and new daily COVID-19 cases (gray shading). The midpoint of mobility reductions (green dot) is used to define an early fever interval, corresponding to F 1 , over the preceding 10 days (red line), and a later fever interval, F 2 , between 10 to 20 days afterwards (purple line). COVID-19 cases are normalized such that their maximum value aligns with the upper limit of the y-axis, and the mobility index is centered such that its maximum value equals the average fever incidence during F 1 . Both COVID-19 cases and mobility are smoothed using a seven-day moving average. Panel labels indicate two-letter state abbreviations and county FIPS code (see Table S1 ). Omitted states have no county with more than 100 confirmed COVID-19 cases as of April 10, 2020. Figure 1 ). Counties having more than 100 confirmed COVID-19 cases as of April 10, 2020 (indicated by cross marks) are included in regression analyses shown in Figure 3 .

91526,"This work investigated dynamic optimization strategies to characterize and control the US COVID-19 outbreak, by minimizing the socioeconomic cost associated with containment strategies and testing. The results provide several overarching conclusions. The quarantining of infected subjects is the most important of the considered mitigation strategies and should be maximized at all times. Additionally, periods of social distancing help to flatten the peak by preventing exposure from asymptomatic and unconfirmed cases. Screening and testing for the disease are key immediately preceding periods of relaxed social distancing, in order to minimize the number of unconfirmed infections during periods of social mobility. Early action has much larger effects than later interventions, even as the later interventions are more drastic. Optimal policies are highly dependent on estimates of ""hidden states,"" i.e., the asymptomatic and unconfirmed cases. Moving horizon (periodically updated) policies and state estimation should be used to mitigate inaccuracies in the model and counts of asymptomatic/unconfirmed cases, by accounting for new data as they becomes available. The ""on-off"" policies identified as optimal are characteristic of the class of problems considered (linear objective function and input-affine nonlinear model). Further, these policies are likely the easiest to implement in practical scenarios and to convey to the general population (as opposed to a policy where the social distancing parameters would take values between their upper and lower bounds). Their implementation would simply alternate between the strictest possible limitations, followed by periods of relative freedom of movement. The model used in this work does not include population influx to and/or outflux from the given system. Therefore, the optimal containment and testing strategies found do not account for new cases that may enter from outside the US. We also assumed that the recovery and death rates for the virus are constant and equal to their historical values for the next 100 days. Thus the results do not account for the possibility of improved medical treatments, vaccine development, viral mutation, etc. Similarly, the model does not account for possible surveillance/detection bias in the historical data (e.g., increased likelihood of testing for subjects with more severe symptoms). "
91558,"The common behavior of Social Distancing exhibits a paradoxical and very dangerous behavior, which could explain the relative inefficiency of Social Distancing alone to disable the virus spreading. The essence of this paradox probably lies in the intrinsic social nature of our human collective, that social component that makes us aggregate and live in communities, so favoring social versus anti-social behavior. This built-in behavior is likely hard to alter, especially in everyday situations like walking: consequently, this counter-intuitive behavior of social distancing in the unmasked case is very dangerous and it should be subject of special attention, being a critical risk factor even in quarantine, due to necessary mobility (people have to go out at least to grab food). Limiting transportation mobility, like done in Italy, can in fact aggravate this problem. Even worst, this risky social behavior has been resilient to enforcement and media campaigns, thus also explaining the inefficiency of many public health measures against COVID-19. A key strategy to get rid of the paradox and its danger is to try to de-activate the built-in social rules of people, by triggering an explicit counter-effect mechanism and so turning unconscious social behavior into conscious anti-social behavior. This safety trigger can be activated via visual stimuli that remind of the danger of social proximity, making people change their common dangerous behavior and implement a safer social distancing strategy. Wearing a mask instead triggers this sort of repulsive effect, ""pushing farther"" people and the skew of the distribution, changing their common behavior so to gain social distance (even by stepping out of sidewalks). The distance increases with patched DIY masks, confirming the effect of a visual stimulus. Goggles act as ""social distance boosters"", again consistently with the hypothesis that a visual stimulus signaling danger makes people more sensible to safety and increases social distancing protection. The good news is that the effectiveness of this booster seems also consistent with time. Consequently, a number of actions can be suggested to help against the virus: Wearing Masks. In the initial onset of the contagion, masks were not recommended in Italy but only to infected persons. Similar recommendations have been given by many other countries 24;25;26;27 . Given that masks lead people to implement social distancing in a safe way and also provide an overall distance boost, usage of masks should be in fact be always recommended to everyone in spite of their protection effectiveness 28 and fitting troubles 29 . Mask shortage and DIY. One of the biggest problems many infected nations have been facing is availability of masks for all the population 30;31;32 , given also their disposable nature. Lacking proper masks, DIY ones can profitably be used: even with no filtering protection, they provide social distancing protection. So, DIY masks can help a lot in all those situations where proper filtering masks are lacking or in shortage. And even when masks are available, adding a DIY mask on top still gives some extra protection. Goggles. Goggles are currently not recommended protection equipment for the population, but they should, given they provide a significant additional boost to social distance. Social Distancing, Media and Education. Suggesting or imposing Social Distancing, via media campaigns or laws, does not work so well on Social Distancing itself and leads to paradoxically dangerous situations. Therefore, Public Health campaigns should not focus only on limiting mobility, asking people to stay at home and providing generic social distancing rules, but also explicitly focus on the key aspects and behavioral problems of necessary mobility and of the dangerous paradox lying within our social nature. The analyzed social distancing behavior can be also used to obtain more precise prediction models (and so, better countermeasures): social distancing cannot be assumed as given, dictated by law or media, it's much more complex and also depends heavily on a so far Comparison of the daily average social distancing among all the five scenarios from February 24 to April 29, 2020 (163cm sidewalks). N1, N2 N3 mark the national decrees, R1, R2, R3 the regional ordinances and M the start of the national media campaign. The unmasked case stops with R3 because of the obligation to wear masks outside. neglected human factor, thus deserving specific attention leading to a real social distancing science. Last but not least, the findings are not only local to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemics but are of general interest in future pandemic situations, given the general nature of the social distancing paradox, and the visual nature of social distancing boosters. "
91974,"Our combined analysis of mobility and epidemics highlighted a striking relation between the negative variation of movement fluxes and the negative variation of the net reproduction number, in all Italian regions, in the time interval of approximately one week, from March 9th till March 16th, during the transition between the two mobility modalities. During this week, the two curves gracefully overlap; at the end of this week, the country has reached a new ""stable"" mobility regime, approximately at 40% of the pre-lockdown level. The two curves exhibit the same pattern everywhere, both at regional and provincial level, with minimal temporal lags. We call this phenomenon, represented schematically in Figure 8 , the ""epi-mob"" pattern. Mobility, the blue curve, is a ""switch"" between two very different levels, before and during the lockdown, with an exponential fall from the first to the second; the epidemics is a peaked distribution with an exponential growth and fall, overlapping with the ""switch"" during the fall. The presumable effectiveness of the lockdown for the containment of the epidemics is further substantiated by the pattern in Figure 7 , relating the timeliness of lockdown in every region with the total number of infected individuals per 100K inhabitants. We can also quantify the time needed to ""switch off"" the country mobility (approx. 1 week to reach the new lower regime) and the time needed to bring the net reproduction number below 1 (again, approx. 1 week). Notice that R t continues to slowly decrease during lockdown, and also that at the beginning of phase 2 (lockdown exit), when mobility begins to rise again, R t does not jump into a new uncontrolled growth, at least until May 17th, the last day of observation in this report. This is probably due to the non-pharmaceutical interventions in place, including the increased compliance of people to use personal protective equipment and respect social distancing (compared to the pre-lockdown phase). Another factor limiting the increase of R t in the Phase 2 could also be related to an increased ability to trace, test and isolate infected individuals. We have also shown that a simple regression model provides reasonable estimates of the R t in a given region (or province) as a function of the in-and out-flows. Clearly, the accuracy of the estimation is influenced by the changes in containment interventions and in citizens' behaviour towards prevention measures. Consequently, learning a regression model for R t during pre-lockdown and early lockdown and applying the model for predicting the R t during phase 2 would probably lead to overestimating it; however, such worstcase scenario might be useful for comparison with the actual R t measured, as a mean to evaluate the effectiveness of the containment policy in act and citizens' social behavior. An interesting point that calls for further study is how to continuously learn an estimation model for the R t , whose accuracy is continuously monitored, to the purpose of nowcasting the R t , shortening as much as possible the lag of time to wait until the R t becomes known. As a conclusion, we believe that this study demonstrated the value of ""big"" mobility data, a detailed proxy of human behavior available every day in real time, to the purpose of refining our understanding of the dynamics of the epidemics, reasoning on the effectiveness of policy choices for non-pharmaceutical interventions and on citizens' compliance to social distancing measures, and help monitoring key epidemic indicators to inform choices as the epidemics unfolds in the coming months. During the first week of lockdown, the two curves describing mobility flows and net reproduction number gracefully overlap. At the end of this week, the country has reached a new ""stable"" mobility regime, approximately at 40% of the pre-lockdown level. The two curves exhibit the same pattern everywhere, both at regional and provincial level, with minimal temporal lags. "
92051,"The current outbreak of novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) poses an unprecedented global health and economic threat to interconnected human societies. Until a vaccine is developed, strategies for controlling the outbreak rely on aggressive social distancing. These measures largely disconnect the social network fabric of human societies, especially in urban areas. Here, we estimate the growth rates and reproductive numbers of COVID-19 in US cities from March 14th through March 19th to reveal a power-law scaling relationship to city population size. This means that COVID-19 is spreading faster on average in larger cities with the additional implication that, in an uncontrolled outbreak, larger fractions of the population are expected to become infected in more populous urban areas. We discuss the implications of these observations for controlling the COVID-19 outbreak, emphasizing the need to implement more aggressive distancing policies in larger cities while also preserving socioeconomic activity."
92136,"Feb. 1, 2020, is the starting time point for all of China (including Wuhan, Hubei) and the beginning Turning Point for the "" Turning Period"" (see report [5] released on Feb. 7, 2020) of COVID-19 as verified by the official daily data released by NHC of China on Feb. 28, 2020 (see also reports from [31] - [32] and [33] - [34] ). Indeed, as the data shown below, we observed that ""Delta"" and ""Gamma"" were below 20% and 2% respectively for 5 consecutive days since February 1. This led them to conclude that February 1 was the starting point of the situation peaking.  First, with February 1, 2020, as the initial starting point of the turning point of the COVID-19 epidemic situation in China, combined with the simulation analysis of our internal model iSEIR in considering the current situation and the ""isolation control program"" currently implemented in China, the time interval for controlling the COVID-19 outbreak should be ""in mid-February, before the end of February 2020"" (see also the report released by [29] - [30] for more details). The above conclusion was reached by the following simulation analysis based on the iSEIR model on Feb. 10, 2020 with the reports given by [29] & [30] : The iSEIR model calculated that at the national level (excluding Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan) as of Feb. 10, 2020 that (see also results from simulations given by Figure below ): 1. The number of infectious and asymptomatic (E) (in % change) will reach a pe ak in about 2 days (Feb. 12, 2020), and then after about 7 days (Feb. 17, 202 0), the rate of increase will decrease to less than 10%; 2. The daily increase in the number of people infected and symptomatic (I) is a steady downward trend, and the rate will decrease to within 10% after about 14 days (Feb. 24, 2020); 3. The proportion of people recovering from infection (R) will return to more tha n 80% after about 17 days (Feb. 27, 2020). Second, as a result, we earmarked the second half of February (around Feb. 20, 2020) as the period when the peak would happen as shown by our simulation results shown below on Feb. 10, 2020 (later confirmed by the data released by NHC of China). Our conclusion that ""the number of infectious and asymptomatic (E) (in % change) will reach a peak in about 2 days (Feb. 12, 2020)"" was confirmed by the following data released by the National Heath Commission (NHC) of China :  We believe that our iSEIR model is a reliable predictor for the Turning Period of the struggle against COVID-19 through introducing concepts of ""Turning Phase"" and ""Supersaturation Phenomenon"". This model accounts for intervention policies and methods such as isolation control programs (e.g. quarantine); such as those implemented in February 2020 in China (see [33] - [34] ). Beyond using our iSEIR model for the COVID-19 in China from late December to early March 2020, we hope to further apply it to outbreaks worldwide. When we incorporate the public official data released by the Chinese government since January 23, 2020, our iSEIR simulation allowed us to conclude that:  February 1, 2020, is the starting point for the formation of the turning point of the COVID-19 epidemic situation in China. Considering the intervention efforts implemented at the state-level, the time period for the control of the COVID-19 epidemic should be around mid-February 2020, and at least by the end of February 2020 (see the original report released [30] - [32] for more details). Before arriving at our final remarks, we want to consider the following with regards to the current global state of the COVID-19 outbreak: 1) The virus can be spread by infected and asymptomatic individuals; 2) At current, there is no fully effective medicine or treatment; and 3) No vaccine. With these conditions, it is important that our iSEIR model be used to aid in modeling the timeline of the COVID-19 outbreak in other countries in shaping public policy. However, we acknowledge that our model is patterned to reflect effective intervention methods and protocols such as the ""Wuhan Quarantine"" (see [36] ). In conclusion, the simulated timeline provided by our iSEIR model best fits outbreak scenarios where early adoption of public health controls and restrictions are implemented to flatten the curve. Finally, we want to reinforce that emergency risk management is always associated with the implementation of an emergency plan. The identification of the Turning Time Period is key to emergency planning as it provides a timeline for effective actions and solutions to combat a pandemic by reducing as much unexpected risk as soon as possible. We can further improve our ability to emergency-plan in urgent events, such as in the control of an infectious disease outbreak like COVID-19 in three key areas: 1) a better spatiotemporal model to describe the mechanics of the spread of infectious diseases; 2) an efficient way to conduct numerical simulation to identify the ""Turning Time Period (Phase)"" for the emergency event, e.g., the timeframe for the outbreak of infectious diseases spread such as OVID-19 virus; and "
92295,"We constructed a near-real-time daily CO2 emission dataset, namely the Carbon Monitor, to monitor the variations of CO2 emissions from fossil fuel combustion and cement production since January 1st 2019 at national level with near-global coverage on a daily basis, with the potential to be frequently updated. Daily CO2 emissions are estimated from a diverse range of activity data, including: hourly to daily electrical power generation data of 29 countries, monthly production data and production indices of industry processes of 62 countries/regions, daily mobility data and mobility indices of road transportation of 416 cities worldwide. Individual flight location data and monthly data were utilised for aviation and maritime transportation sectors estimates. In addition, monthly fuel consumption data that corrected for daily air temperature of 206 countries were used for estimating the emissions from commercial and residential buildings. This Carbon Monitor dataset manifests the dynamic nature of CO2 emissions through daily, weekly and seasonal variations as influenced by workdays and holidays, as well as the unfolding impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. The Carbon Monitor near-real-time CO2 emission dataset shows a 7.8% decline of CO2 emission globally from Jan 1st to Apr 30th in 2020 when compared with the same period in 2019, and detects a re-growth of CO2 emissions by late April which are mainly attributed to the recovery of economy activities in China and partial easing of lockdowns in other countries. Further, this daily updated CO2 emission dataset could offer a range of opportunities for related scientific research and policy making."
92723,"Due to their high economic cost, there has been a heated debate on the contribution of lockdown measures on the spreading of the epidemic. Arguing that the effect of the lockdown could not be visible until the average delay from rising of the symptoms to deaths, some papers, like [2] , even claimed that in absence of any lockdown measures the number of deaths would have been less than actually observed. As shown in [3] , this is not the case. The distribution of time delay from infection to death is very broad (log-normal) and positively skewed, so we expect that more than half of the people would have died before the average lag time. So, it is misleading to fit the data just after lockdown to estimate what would happen without implementing the lockdown. In this note, we showed evidence of the effect of lockdown on the curve of daily deaths. Firstly, we see that all curves peak ∼20 days after t lock : this corresponds to the number of days from infection to death when we expect more than half of the infected at t lock to have died already. After t lock , the q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q q number of new infections becomes negligible so the majority of people dying were those infected before the lockdown was implemented. Sweden, the only European country in this analysis that did not implement any lockdown, shows a delayed peak and a different dynamical pattern (Figure 3 ), confirming our initial hypothesis that the epidemic spreading stopped quite abruptly because of the lockdown. A possible alternative explanation is that the virus had in fact reached all susceptible people in each country. But in this case, the total deaths should have been correlated with the size of each nation, not to the number of infected people at the start of the lockdown. However, rescaling by population size leads to a dispersion 2.2 times larger at the peak than rescaling by the total number of deaths ( Figure  2) , suggesting that the saturation hypothesis is not warranted, in line with several previous studies as well [4, 5, 6] . A similar idea was also discussed in Ref. [4] where the authors provide further evidence i.e. serology studies and the cumulative per-capita daily deaths, to reach to same conclusion. Even if correlation does not prove causality, the quality of the curve collapse shown in Figure 1b ) and the complementary analysis proposed by the authors in [7, 8, 9] provide strong evidence of a positive effect of lockdown measures in curbing the number of fatalities. We thank F. Zamponi, M. Kolanovic, E. Marinari, F. Valka and E. Jani for useful discussions. "
92746,"We have proposed an epidemiological model for the spread of COVID-19. The model is based on spread at local level which can be at the level of province, town, city or districts by combining a statistical approach and using the metapopulation network of infected locations. The model incorporates a few parameters which represent the effect of spread by asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic individuals, restricted mobility of individuals, and the testing statistics. Predictions of total number of tested with COVID-19 people are made at the level of state and the entire country, based on the data of testing as of May 7, 2020, and under linear and log-linear growth of testing statistics. Finally it is shown that the spread can be contained in very near future if linear or log-linear growth of testing is adapted. The stabilization of infected cases primarily depends on the number of testing and the inter location transition of population or the strictness of lockdown. If the testing rate is low or moderate it may show less count of infected cases. But there is a chance of second wave to hit-back. If the testing rate is sufficiently large and executed with proper sampling scheme then the count of positive will get stabilized much early. The proposed epidemiological model can be applied and generalized for prediction of total number of tested with COVID-19 people at any country. Indeed, if metapopulation network is a network of countries then the prediction can be made at the world level based on the data of transmission of populations across the countries.  "
93106,"The analysis in this study puts all new social distancing measures and testing capacities into effect immediately on June 1. In practice, the change will be gradual. Our model provides a tool to investigate how to relax social distancing measures gradually as the City ramps up its testing capacity over time. An analysis along these lines will be our next line of attack. Moreover, as discussed in the appendix, we have a contact tracing mechanism in our model, where close contacts of every positive case are put into isolation. In other words, our model implicitly assumes that the bottleneck is the testing capacity, not the contract tracing capacity. We plan to use our model to estimate the number of contact tracers needed to keep up with the increasing testing capacity and new cases. The interpretation of the pre-and in-Pause social distancing measures are somewhat clear, each corresponding to life before and after March 22. Relaxing social distancing measures by any percentage corresponds to adjusting R-naught to lie appropriately between the R-naught values of these two extremes. It should be noted that it will require work to understand which "
93291,"Following the emergence of a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) and its spread outside of China, Europe has experienced large epidemics. In response, many European countries have implemented unprecedented non-pharmaceutical interventions including case isolation, the closure of schools and universities, banning of mass gatherings and/or public events, and most recently, wide-scale social distancing including local and national lockdowns. In this technical update, we extend a semi-mechanistic Bayesian hierarchical model that infers the impact of these interventions and estimates the number of infections over time. Our methods assume that changes in the reproductive number - a measure of transmission - are an immediate response to these interventions being implemented rather than broader gradual changes in behaviour. Our model estimates these changes by calculating backwards from temporal data on observed to estimate the number of infections and rate of transmission that occurred several weeks prior, allowing for a probabilistic time lag between infection and death. In this update we extend our original model [Flaxman, Mishra, Gandy et al 2020, Report #13, Imperial College London] to include (a) population saturation effects, (b) prior uncertainty on the infection fatality ratio, (c) a more balanced prior on intervention effects and (d) partial pooling of the lockdown intervention covariate. We also (e) included another 3 countries (Greece, the Netherlands and Portugal). The model code is available at  We are now reporting the results of our updated model online at  We estimated parameters jointly for all M=14 countries in a single hierarchical model. Inference is performed in the probabilistic programming language Stan using an adaptive Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) sampler."
93387,"In this prevalence of pandemic COVID-19, ODE based kinetic models are being trusted extensively for the purpose of predicting time dependent profiles and steady state behaviour of the epidemic dynamics. In this paper, we argue that cellular automata based simulations can provide a more realistic and insightful platform for modeling this dynamics. It is undeniable that a substantial variability has been observed in the nature of the course of the disease in countries and provinces all around the world. While a fully operational clinically trialed vaccine can only be expected after a year or so for everyone, several countries are struggling hard to find a proper mitigation strategy for the disease. It is interesting to see that publicly available data of confirmed daily cases for different countries are quite different from each other. While in some countries the disease has completed its course in around 60 days (like, Germany, Switzerland, Singapore etc.), in some other countries it is taking more than 80 days to reach the peak (like, Italy, India, Brazil etc.). In countries like Spain, Portugal and Turkey, a distinct departure from symmetric bell-shaped behaviour of active cases can be observed, which is heading towards a saturation, indicating a substantial persistence of the disease. For Iran, emergence of a second peak is imminent, which cannot be accounted for using ordinary differential equation based SIR models. Many countries have shown equivalent rise of the epidemic in initial stages are showing drastic divergence in the later stages. The applicability of strategies like aggressive testing, which found their success in countries like Singapore, Hong Kong and South Korea, are doubted for the high population countries like, India, USA etc. To analyse and interpret this data, it must be considered that along with the parameters associated with infection itself, the dynamics reflects the human interventions and reactions as well, which are highly probabilistic. In this paper, we have used a lattice-based PCA epidemiological modeling to efficiently mimic a pandemic environment and find out the contributions of each major parameter associated with the pandemic spread. We identified the role of different factors like probability of exposure, testing probability, promptness of implementing lockdown etc. which can not only be used to design better strategies to control a pandemic like COVID-19, but also can be used as analyzing tools to understand and explain proposed initiatives like social distancing, usage of facial mask, importance of sanitizers etc. Our exhaustive analysis shows that countries with high population density should handle lockdown and migration carefully as they have higher risk of getting infected. Using quantities like i max and τ , we have also characterised and quantified the independence of rise and fall of the distribution, showing the clear influence of human intervention strategies. Our model individually associates tunable parameters with several practical factors like population density, testing efficiency, public awareness, health-care facility, general immunity etc. which are implicit to a country, and can contribute significantly in the country-wise data variations. By demonstrating the flexibility of the model, we conclude that this is not only capable of explaining the reasons behind divergence of epidemic dynamics in different countries, but also has the potential to explain unforeseen nature of a new data that might depend strongly on space information, behavioural probabilities or underlying fluctuations. Our study establishes a prescription about how the resultant distribution changes its properties (e.g., peak position, sharpness of rise, lifetime of epidemic, asymmetric long-tailed fall etc.) driven by each of these parameters. As this simulation-based study explicitly includes the spatial factors into the dynamics, incorporating realistic behavioural and demographic features is achievable through this model. Thus, our methodology proposes a more accurate and flexible platform to understand the country-wise diversity of the observed data than the mean-field models. "
93441,"Social distancing has emerged as the primary mitigation strategy to combat the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States. However, large-scale evaluation of the public's response to social distancing campaigns has been lacking. We used anonymized and aggregated mobility data from Google Location History users to estimate the impact of social distancing recommendations on bulk mobility among users who have opted into this service. We found that state-of-emergency declarations resulted in approximately a 10% reduction in time spent away from places of residence. Implementation of one or more social distancing policies resulted in an additional 25% reduction in mobility the following week. Subsequent shelter-in-place mandates provided an additional 29% reduction. Our findings provide evidence that state-wide mandates are effective in promoting social distancing within this study group."
93490,"In the context of the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic, several reports and studies have attempted to model and predict the spread of the disease. There is also intense debate about policies for limiting the damage, both to health and to the economy. On the one hand, the health and safety of the population is the principal consideration for most countries. On the other hand, we cannot ignore the potential for long-term economic damage caused by strict nation-wide lockdowns. In this working paper, we present a quantitative way to compute lockdown decisions for individual cities or regions, while balancing health and economic considerations. Furthermore, these policies are learnt automatically by the proposed algorithm, as a function of disease parameters (infectiousness, gestation period, duration of symptoms, probability of death) and population characteristics (density, movement propensity). We account for realistic considerations such as imperfect lockdowns, and show that the policy obtained using reinforcement learning is a viable quantitative approach towards lockdowns."
93527,"In this work we introduced a modified version of the diffusion equation, mediated by a Lifshitz scaling together with the diffusion coefficient φ(τ ). The diffusion time σ is analogous to the so-called fictitious time in stochastic quantization theories [26] . We were able to find an analytic solution for this diffusion equation, and to use the standard Gaussian curves to interpret σ as the lockdown time, if such an equation is applied to model pandemic cases. Therefore, we investigate two possible models with φ(τ ) having (anti)kink, and double (anti)kink-like profiles. These models were used to fit real active cases data of COVID-19 from three different countries (Germany, Spain, and Brazil). We successfully depicted the active cases curves for Germany and Spain, and use them to constraint some of our free parameters to generate curves for Brazil. Then, we predicted four scenarios for the advance of the pandemic in Brazil, based on 30 and 90 lockdown days. Up to May 02, 2020, 16.57% of active cases in Brazil are classified as critical [3] . Therefore, knowing that Brazil has 32703 ICU facilities available [25] , the maximum number of active cases allowed for this country is 197363, if the rate of critical cases still constant in the next weeks, as well as if the ICUs were allocated only for patients diagnosed with COVID-19. These scenarios alert for a potential crash in the health care system of Brazil if no lockdown measure is taken in the next weeks. Moreover, the solution which best fitted the active cases data up to May 02, 2020 is the red curve from Fig. 9 . Such a solution predicts that the pandemic is going to be fully controlled after day 198 (August 28, 2020), when the number of active cases is less than 1000. It is relevant to point that the Lifshitz scaling exponent was essential to depict the numerical active curves here studied. Moreover, we also verified that the double (anti)kink-like profiles were able to fit better the real data than the single (anti)kink-like solutions. Consequently, we can conjecture that multiple anti(kink)-like models, like those introduced in [27] , would improve the level of precision of our active cases curves. Another interesting perspective consists in investigating solutions for the diffusion equation derived from models with multiple (anti)lump like solutions, such as those presented in [28] . Moreover, the methodology here adopted can be applied to other pandemics, as well as to other COVID-19 data set like new daily cases, for instance. "
94321,"Understanding public reactions to the virus and the non-pharmaceutical interventions should be of great help to fight COVID-19 in a strategic way. In order to provide an integrated perspective on public reactions related to the pandemic propagation and the non-pharmaceutical interventions, we examine the day-by-day mobility variations across the U.S. by leveraging mobile device location data and the measures related to social distancing. While data-driven study we conduct shows the mobility patterns for the general public, we would like to introduce an additional potential research area that utilizes the mobility measures as an open discussion. "
94460,"We present and begin to explore a collection of social data that represents part of the COVID-19 pandemic's effects on the United States. This data is collected from a range of sources and includes longitudinal trends of news topics, social distancing behaviors, community mobility changes, web searches, and more. This multimodal effort enables new opportunities for analyzing the impacts such a pandemic has on the pulse of society. Our preliminary results show that the number of COVID-19-related news articles published immediately after the World Health Organization declared the pandemic on March 11, and that since that time have steadily decreased---regardless of changes in the number of cases or public policies. Additionally, we found that politically moderate and scientifically-grounded sources have, relative to baselines measured before the beginning of the pandemic, published a lower proportion of COVID-19 news than more politically extreme sources. We suggest that further analysis of these multimodal signals could produce meaningful social insights and present an interactive dashboard to aid further exploration."
95034,"An urgent problem in controlling COVID-19 spreading is to understand the role of undocumented infection. We develop a five-state model for COVID-19, taking into account the unique features of the novel coronavirus, with key parameters determined by the government reports and mathematical optimization. Tests using data from China, South Korea, Italy, and Iran indicate that the model is capable of generating accurate prediction of the daily accumulated number of confirmed cases and is entirely suitable for real-time prediction. The drastically disparate testing and diagnostic standards/policies among different countries lead to large variations in the estimated parameter values such as the duration of the outbreak, but such uncertainties have little effect on the occurrence time of the inflection point as predicted by the model, indicating its reliability and robustness. Model prediction for Italy suggests that insufficient government action leading to a large fraction of undocumented infection plays an important role in the abnormally high mortality in that country. With the data currently available from United Kingdom, our model predicts catastrophic epidemic scenarios in the country if the government did not impose strict travel and social distancing restrictions. A key finding is that, if the percentage of undocumented infection exceeds a threshold, a non-negligible hidden population can exist even after the the epidemic has been deemed over, implying the likelihood of future outbreaks should the currently imposed strict government actions be relaxed. This could make COVID-19 evolving into a long-term epidemic or a community disease a real possibility, suggesting the necessity to conduct universal testing and monitoring to identify the hidden individuals."
95281,"Accurately estimating the effectiveness of stay-at-home orders (SHOs) on reducing social contact and disease spread is crucial for mitigating pandemics. Leveraging individual-level location data for 10 million smartphones, we observe that by April 30th---when nine in ten Americans were under a SHO---daily movement had fallen 70% from pre-COVID levels. One-quarter of this decline is causally attributable to SHOs, with wide demographic differences in compliance, most notably by political affiliation. Likely Trump voters reduce movement by 9% following a local SHO, compared to a 21% reduction among their Clinton-voting neighbors, who face similar exposure risks and identical government orders. Linking social distancing behavior with an epidemic model, we estimate that reductions in movement have causally reduced SARS-CoV-2 transmission rates by 49%."
95491,"We see that despite of a national strategy for containment, each state has performed differently and its performance depends upon the ground level implementation and the strategies adopted by the states themselves. This leads us to wonder whether there are other factors that could explain the success or failure of the lock down strategy. For example, the literacy rate of Kerala is 94% whereas that in Rajasthan is 66.11% or that the population density is 11,320 people per km 2 in Delhi while it is only 17 people per km 2 in Arunachal Pradesh [4] . Other parameters could be the number of hospital beds, doctors, police stations, expenditure on health and education infrastructure etc. This requires further investigation and could be one of the follow up studies done after this. The limitations of this study are: 1. The data is dependent on the testing capacity and testing rate of each state and hence does not represent the true number of cases. 2. The models do not take into consideration arbitrary events like the one in Nizamuddin and similarly cannot account for other measures taken in the future by the government. For instance, with the lifting of the lock down on May 3 rd the proposed model would not take this change into account and hence would need a modification. 3. The predictions made for each state are only valid until the conditions that have been prevalent during the duration data collection remain the same. What we learn from looking at the different states and their performance is that applying the same containment plain uniformly throughout the country is not very effective when compared to the locally planned strategies. For example, the policies of the state government of Kerala, Maharashtra and Rajasthan are much more effective at curbing the spread of the virus than Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and Telangana which are operating according to the national strategy. A uniform policy does not discriminate between the states based on the demographics of the population i.e. a large number of daily wage workers hail from the states of Uttar Pradesh and Bihar and cannot afford to stay at home for 21 days whereas Kerala, having a very high literacy rate and people working in professional sector, can afford to do so. The idea behind breaking down the strategies according to state and then district can be understood with this simple example. The Bhilwara model of stringent lockdown and ruthless containment cannot be applied to the Dharavi area of Mumbai which has a very high population density and any sort of containment could lead to the area becoming a hotspot due to lack of sanitation, medical facilities and education. In the future while developing policies, regarding epidemic management, we must do so in a manner that focusses on local containment rather than central containment. The methodology applied here can be used to investigate the situation in other countries or regions as well "
95682,"While containment policies of the Covid-19 epidemic have been applied in different countries, a comparative quantitative measure of the efficiency of these policies is not available. We show here that the time evolution of the pandemic doubling time Td(t) is a reliable measure of the efficiency of the Lockdown, case Finding, mobile Tracing (LFT) policy using modern technologies versus the traditional Lockdown Stop and Go (LSG) policy. This goal has been achieved to verify by extracting the time evolution of the doubling time Td(t). The results provide a quantitative measure and make possible predictions on the time evolution of epidemic for different containment policy. Where the lowest s factor, the characteristic time of the exponential growing Td(t) in the arrested regime, was reached by LFT policy also the lowest number of deaths and the shorter time width of the epidemic dome was reached. The record for the largest number of deaths is correlated with the largest s factor in the near threshold regime where no containment measures were taken in time. LFT policy has been able to reduce both the intensity and time width of the Covid-19 pandemic dome achieving both a low number of deaths and low economic losses"
95801,"Recent literature has shown that Google Trends data can successfully explain the current and future patterns of the state of the economy, especially during unfavorable events [8, 13, 14] . Differently from recent financial crises, COVID-19 is an exogenous shock to the system that has affected several countries with different timings related to the spreading of the disease. We have investigated the exposure of the stock index returns of Italy, France, Germany, Great Britain, the United States and Spain to GT-COVID-19 indices based on search-engine query volumes. Our findings show that most of these indices have significant explanatory power on stock market returns. Interestingly, the Italian GT-COVID-19 index acts as forerunner and better explains other countries' market returns. Moreover, the greatest impact of GT indices occur in correspondence of the different phases of the lock-down in Italy, despite the public awareness of the contagion in China since January. The disruptive effect of COVID-19 on financial markets is well described by the public concern perceived in Italy, which has been the first Western country to experience a virulent outbreak and to adopt drastic measures after China. "
95820,"The COVID-19 is spreading world-wide but stopped spreading in China. Since the spread of the disease is highly related to population migration, it follows a Lévy flight behavior which is characteristic of human mobility [20] . The long incubating period together with the Lévy flight long jumps makes the disease very hard to control and raise the alarm for the other countries. By the time that infected individual is being detectable (5 days in the best scenario), one can already perform a long-distance trip and further spread the disease. This is the reason why quarantines are so critical not only for infected persons, but also for others that were nearby infected individuals. The lifetime of the disease in a city is characterized by two stages, uncontrolled infection in early times and decaying stage at later times once quarantines are being performed. These two stages can explain the disease situation in China and predict the situation in other locations in the world if similar strategies will be adopted. The stage of the disease in China is almost stable although it is the country with most of infection cases (as for 18 of March 2020). The reasoning is that most of the infected cities in China applied strict quarantine measures, leading to exponential decay of disease. However, in other locations around the world, most of the cities are still at the early stages at which the disease is less controlled and may lead to another or even worse outbreak at high risks. "
96354,"The COVID-19 pandemic forced us, scientists, to tackle the difficult task of trying to understand a new disease at the same time it is killing people in our neighborhoods and stressing our health services. As shown in this paper, the lack of solid knowledge on basic questions produces also an ignorance of what may happen in the future, even the present situation being well described by a simple mathematical model. We hope that more basic research may help fill the knowledge gaps, but probably that will take time. Since the beginning of the pandemic, we have seen many papers with very different predictions on the population fraction that may die as a consequence of COVID-19, most of them too catastrophic. Part of this disparity is due to our ignorance on basic facts about the virus and the disease, as already remarked, and on the number of mildly symptomatic or asymptomatic cases. Another part is a consequence of the difficulty in estimating the many parameters in any realistic mathematical model. In this paper we used a model as simple as possible in order to have the minimum number of parameters, and devised a procedure to estimate these parameters based only on the more faithful data, the number of deaths. We avoided using information on the number of confirmed cases, or trying to guess underreporting factors. If we had considered more complete models, we would probably have to estimate a larger number of parameters, resulting on a larger uncertainty. We believe that our results, uncertain as they are, may be useful in showing both a worst and a best possible outcome. One important result of our calculations is that the epidemics both in Lombardy and in São Paulo would have been much worse if social distancing measures had not been taken. We saw that in an optimistic possibility, the number of cases of COVID-19 in Lombardy might not increase after the social distancing measures are relaxed. However, we also saw that it is likely that the number of cases shows a new quick rise, being then necessary either to keep these measures for longer, or use alternative measures. As social distancing is being relaxed at many countries, particularly in Italy, it is possible that the uncertainty in our results will be solved in the next days according to whether the number of cases will grow rapidly, or not. In São Paulo state, as the fraction of infected individuals is up to now much smaller than in Lombardy, herd immunity is still far. As a consequence, our calculations predict that the fraction of infected individuals will still increase for some time, even in the most optimistic case. As stressed before, strengthening social distance measures could alleviate this situation. We believe that the two locations in which we fitted the model to real data may serve as examples of what may happen in other locations. "
96625," The model developed by us and reported here has a distinct advantage over other models as it gives parameters tuned with the data, that provides insight over the actual situation.  It accurately fit's exponential growth, linear growth, and a natural decline in the pandemic.  When a government takes a major step related to Corona Virus, the feature tuning algorithm, discussed above, is trained on the data to get the new changed value of β as a result.  Even during the lockdown, there will be no decrease in the number of cases as revealed by the data.  As this model has a high bias, it will get more accurate after training it on some more lock-down data observed in near future  Actual Number of cases at any day in near future will be much higher than the total number of cases reported. Convergence of these two values will result in the halt of exponential growth.  Graph suggests that the exponential growth will be slowed down in the lock-down, but we need to observe a stricter social distancing for a halt of growth. "
96988,"In conclusion, we have presented here an analysis targeted at assessing the level of granularity in terms of the variability necessary in the analysis to draw informative scenarios. In particular, we have shown that the modeling of this heterogeneity is crucial to correctly model extreme scenarios and characterize their uncertainty. Indeed, using a spatial and temporal random-effects model, we have shown that the added variability is necessary to (a) provide better coverage of the confidence intervals, and thus, more appropriately quantify the uncertainty associated to a certain prediction or the effect of a given policy and (b) explain rare events and understand the formation of outbreaks -which averaged models would not allow and which are nonetheless crucial elements to take into account when weighting different scenarios. Our analysis of the real data has also shown that the reproductive number vastly varies depending on the group considered -as such, it seems that an informative model would at least try to take into account the spatial heterogeneity, if not the full one. We emphasize again that our study does not aspire to draw predictive scenarios, but rather to understand how models and predictive scenarios are truly impacted by the choice and inherent variability of the R -and the great variability that we have imputed seems to highlight the need for a fine -grain analysis. Further Discussion on the Variability of R. In our data analysis for the spatial random-effects model, we have assumedc to follow a well-behaved γ distribution. We have also tried changing this to a Caucy distribution (which has much fatter tails, and thus, could add more variability). The results we obtained with this new prior were similar to ones obtained using the Gamma distribution, thus highlighting the fact that our spatial random-effects model does not seem to be extremely sensitive to the choice of the prior. To continue building up this work, it would be interesting to enrich our model for Rwith additional sources of information -thus controlling even better for the day-to-day variations exhibited in our model fit for R. In particular, this model could be improved by controlling for other environmental variables, such as the temperature, which we leave as further work. Disclaimer. This model is a tool for exploring the effect of uncertainties and variation in the R 0 for the virus and the effect of this variability in different types of interventions, but we do not claim to be predictive of disease dynamics for any specific populations (credit to McGee et al. for disclaimer). "
97143,"This report describes an extension of a single region (epidemic) model that furnishes a (pandemic) model of regions that collectively participate in a pandemic. Our focus has been on the genesis of a second wave of new cases-and potential deaths-due to the loss of immunity within a regional population and the influx of people from other regions. We have showcased this model by applying it to statistics from the United States, treating each State as a separable region. When using the optimised model parameters one can simulate the impact of various strategies or (non-pharmaceutical) responses. If one subscribes to the modelling in this report, then there are several narratives one could entertain. These depend sensitively on the rate at which the immunity is lost. If SARS-CoV-2 confers immunity that lasts for years, the following narrative might be appropriate: However, this relaxation will not return to pre-pandemic levels of interpersonal contact. In other words, there will be an enduring pressure to reduce interpersonal contact, which will reduce the time spent in the company of others by 5% or less. The road to equilibrium will be relatively smooth with a slight bump (second wave) at about seven months following the initial outbreak (i.e., November). This will not require lockdown but there will be an appreciable increase in the number of cases and critical care uptake. This second wave should last for about five weeks and may be confounded by the onset of a flu season."" Under this narrative, social distancing will become 'a way of living' with COVID-19 and reflect changing attitudes to prosocial behaviour; very much like our attitudes to recycling, smoking or outdated and dangerous practices, such as the use of laudanum or mercury in the Victorian age. For example, unnecessary commuting and international meetings may be seen as antisocial and unhygienic. Similarly, shaking hands may become as socially sanctioned as frotteurism. In short, changing attitudes, affordances and dispositions may be sufficient social distancing mechanisms to guarantee an endemic equilibrium. Note that the above narrative makes no mention of 'exit strategies', vaccination, or anti-viral therapy. This is because strategic responses are modelled as an inherent part of the epidemiology. In other words, they are treated as part of the process as a reactive strategy, as opposed to a proactive strategy. This does not mean that governments are under no pressure to declare their exit strategies. Rather, this declaration is part of the process of changing attitudes to social behaviour. As in , this narrative is not a prediction. It is a concrete example of the kind of prediction on offer, with a suitably formulated and informed epidemiological model that installs social behaviour into the dynamics. This particular narrative depends on long-lasting immunity. A different story would be told if immunity to SARS-CoV-2 is lost within months. This speaks to two pressing issues. First, has the first wave induced a substantive herd immunity predicted by the DCM? Second, if this immunity has been induced, how long will it last? The answer to the first question should be available within the next few weeks, as studies assessing community levels of seroconversion appear. The answer to the second question is more vexed because-from a purely epidemiological perspective-one might have to wait and see (given the many factors that determine the loss of immunity and potential variation within different cohorts). In the final report of this series, we will estimate the period of immunity by comparing models over a range of short-term immunity, in terms of their model evidence. At some point over the next month or so, there should be sufficient data to render this model comparison sufficiently definitive to estimate the effective period of immunity one can expect. As with all dynamic causal modelling studies, everything is entirely conditioned upon the models that have been evaluated in terms of their evidence. In this report, the aim of the modelling is not to provide predictions or guidance per se-it is to show that such predictions are possible under a suitably configured model using state-of-the-art variational Bayesian model inversion and reduction. In other words, one can reproduce these analyses under different models or prior assumptions in a few minutes on a personal computer. This allows one to explore different models in an efficient fashion; thereby treating the modelling as hypotheses testing, as more data becomes available. Being able to identify the best hypothesis or modelin terms of its parameterisation of structure-is potentially important. This is because the model and (maximum a posteriori) parameters can then form the basis of a prediction about data that has not yet been observed, i.e., the future. In this light, we will not list the shortcomings of this particular model. Any 'shortcoming' is just a statement of an alternative model that can be included in the model comparison procedure to optimise the model in and of itself. Perhaps the most important aspect of this modelling is its focus on herd immunity and the notion of an adaptive or reactive strategy. As in our provisional modelling of a single outbreak in a single region, the passage from the onset of an outbreak to endemic equilibrium depends on establishing herd immunity to a greater or lesser extent. This underwrites the repeated call for a greater understanding of the virology and immunology of COVID-19. Not only will this speak to therapeutic interventions, but simply being able to measure the proportion of individuals in a population who are immune would provide informative constraints on modelling-and subsequent projections. The second aspect-of adaptive social distancingcan be contrasted with other formulations that prescribe a fixed pattern of social distancing. For example, a sawtooth or intermittent social distancing that enables the acquisition of herd immunity without overwhelming critical care capacity (Ferguson et al., 2006) . Both adaptive and proactive schedules (e.g., encouraging the use of facemasks) have their merits and could be evaluated using the procedures outlined above. Adaptive strategies provide a quantitative and formal guideline for personal and governmental responses as the pandemic develops. In other words, the response becomes part of the ensemble dynamics that determine the eventual outcome. A pragmatic advantage of adaptive strategies (see Figure 4 ) is that they can be operationalised given available estimates of the prevalence. For a threshold strategy, one can simply revert to one mode of social distancing or another, whenever a particular threshold is passed. An interesting perspective on adaptive strategies follows from the fact that-in the model-they are an integral part of the process. In other fields, this corresponds to the notion of Chaos control; e.g., (Rose, 2014) and may yield to an optimal control theoretic treatment (Fleming and Sheu, 2002; Kappen, 2005; Todorov and Jordan, 2002) . In other words, the optimal policy can be treated very much like an engineering problem or, indeed, an active inference problem. This brings us to our last point. In closing, there is one perspective on applications of generative models to pandemics that touches on (unrelated) work in theoretical neurobiology. This work tries to understand the behaviour of sentient systems, such as ourselves, in terms of active inference and the optimisation of variational free energy associated with our internal world models . On this view, using a generative model of a pandemic to inform policies becomes formally identical to the imperatives that underwrite active inference (Clark, 2016; Hohwy, 2013) . In brief, these imperatives are to bring about those situations that we find the least surprising; namely, that we all elude death and return to normal. "
97310,"The results show a generally strong correlation between strengthening of the quarantine controls, i.e. increasing Q(t) as learnt by the neural network model; actions taken by the regions' respective governments; and decrease of the effective reproduction number R t . For example, in Italy, government restrictions reportedly (Ghiglione et al. 2020) tightened during the week preceding mid March, which is also when our model shows a sharp increase in Q(t) and corresponding decrease in R t (figures 4b, c). For Wuhan and South Korea, similar cusps in government interventions took place earlier, in the weeks leading to and after the end of January (Cyranoski 2020) and February, respectively (Normille 2020) . These cusps were also captured well by our model (Figures 2b, c and  6b , c, respectively). Even for the USA, Q(t) shows a stagnation till 20 March 2020, after which it shows a sharp increase accompanied with a decrease in R t (Figures 8b, c) , which is in alignment with the ramping up of government policies and quarantine interventions post mid March in the worst affected states like New York, New Jersey, California, and Michigan. A comparative analysis of the quarantine strength function Q(t) learned by the neural network for different countries reveals that Wuhan had the highest magnitude and South Korea had the highest growth rate of Q(t). This can be attributed to the stringent government interventions and strict public health measures including immediate isolation and quarantine impositions in Wuhan and South Korea. This eventually resulted in the halting of infection spread and a corresponding R t < 1 within a month for Wuhan ( Figure  2c ) and within 20 days for South Korea (figure 6c) after the first signs of a pandemic were recognized. It is reported that the infected case count stagnated nation-wide in China by the beginning of March (Cyranoski 2020 ) and in South Korea by the end of March (Fisher & Sang-Hun 2020) ; which eventually led to a stagnation in the quarantine interventions employed in these countries. This is in general qualitative agreement with our forecasting results which show a plateau in Q(t) and R t at R t < 1: Figures 3a,b and 7a ,b. In Italy, as of March 20 th , I(t) is appearing to be linear (Figure 4a) , which is consistent with lower rates of infections being actually reported (Horowitz & Kirkpatrick 2020 ) and can be taken as a precursor to stagnation. It is also consistent with adoption of strict movement restrictions by the government shortly before the March 20 th date. We forecast that, for Italy, R t will drop below 1 and Q(t), R t both will stagnate between mid to end of April 2020 (Figure 5a , b) indicating halting of the spread of infection. Owing to the relaxed quarantine and isolation policies in the US in its initial stages post the infection spread, our model converges to Q(t) ≈ 0.4 − 0.6 ( Figure 8b ) which is the smallest compared to other regions. Even though the effective R t is still greater than 1 as of April 1 2020 (Figure 8c) , its growth has started to show a decreasing trend and we expect the infection to start showing stagnation with R t < 1 by 20 April 2020 if the current US policies continue without change (Figures 9b, 10a ). This will be accompanied by a continuous ramp up of quarantine policies (Figure 9a ). At its peak, we forecast the infected count to reach approximately 600,000 before stagnation, again assuming no change in US policies. Our mixed model analysis for USA, employing Q(t) learnt from the models of Wuhan, Italy and South Korea in the USA model starting from 1 April 2020, reveals that stronger quarantine policies (Figure 10b ) might lead to an accelerated plateauing in the infected case count, as shown in Figure 10a , and subsequently smaller infected case count. On the other hand, in agreement with National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases estimates (Miller 2020) , we forecast that relaxing or abandoning the quarantine policies gradually over the period of the next 17 days may well lead to ∼ 1 million infections without any stagnation in the infected case count (Figure 10a ) by mid April 2020. "
97353,"The 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19), emerged late December 2019 in China, is now rapidly spreading across the globe. At the time of writing this paper, the number of global confirmed cases has passed two millions and half with over 180,000 fatalities. Many countries have enforced strict social distancing policies to contain the spread of the virus. This have changed the daily life of tens of millions of people, and urged people to turn their discussions online, e.g., via online social media sites like Twitter. In this work, we describe the first Arabic tweets dataset on COVID-19 that we have been collecting since January 1st, 2020. The dataset would help researchers and policy makers in studying different societal issues related to the pandemic. Many other tasks related to behavioral change, information sharing, misinformation and rumors spreading can also be analyzed."
98275,"The COVID-19 pandemic is testing the structural strength of our global society. Most national governments have simultaneously reacted to the contagion by applying mobility restrictions to contain the disease outbreak. The resulting disruption is similar to that caused by a natural disaster, but the effect is on a global scale. For this reason, in this work we analyze the effects of the lockdown on three different national mobility systems, the French, Italian and British, by means of a 13M users dataset from Facebook. We provide a structural analysis of the mobility network for each nation and quantify the effect of mobility restrictions applied to hinder COVID-19 outbreak by means of percolation analysis. We find that lockdown mainly affects national smallwordness i.e., strong reduction of long-range connections in favor of local paths. Our analysis suggests that the national resilience to massive stress differs and depends upon the inner connectivity structure. Indeed, the three countries display very different mobility patterns that reflect the diversity in their underlying infrastructure, more concentrated in the case of France and UK and more distributed in the case of Italy. Our results may provide insights on the interplay between mobility patterns and structural dependencies in the network of movements at national level and may help design better transportation networks, improve system efficiency during natural catastrophes and contain epidemics spreading.

98345,"Model (2.1) fitting to daily COVID-19 notified cases for Maharashtra, Delhi, Tamil Nadu and India is Depicted in Fig 2. Estimated values of the model (2.1) parameters and unknown initial conditions are provided in Appendix B, Table B1 and Table B2 , respectively. In Maharashtra, estimate of symptomatic influx fraction (κ) suggesting low number (about 3%) of symptomatic infected in the population (See Table B1 in Appendix B). However, higher value of the transmission rate (β 1 ), and low value of the transmission variability factor (ρ) indicates that existence of potential super-spreaders among symptomatic infected (see R 0 in equation (2.3) and Table B1 in Appendix B). Low value of κ (see Table B1 in Appendix B) indicates there may be a large number of undetected COVID-19 cases in the population of Maharashtra. However, low value of ρ indicates contribution of these asymptomatic infected towards new infection is very low (see expression of R 0 in equation (2.3) and Table B1 in Appendix B). To further investigate on super-spreaders, we varies κ (from 0.1 to 0.5) in the expression of R 0 . We found that around 60% -92% increase in the current value of R 0 (see Table B5 ) if 10% to 50% new infection become symptomatic. This is an alarming situation as in coming days there may be a possibility of higher percentage of symptomatic infection and which leads to more and more super-spreaders in the population of Maharashtra. We predicted notified cases as well deaths in Maharashtra for different lock-down situation (see Methods section) using our models with and without lock-down (see equations (2.1) and (2.2)) starting from March, 9 th 2020 till May, 7 th 2020 (60 days). Predicted total notified cases and deaths under different (no lock-down, 20%, 40%, 60% and 80%) lock-down scenario in Maharashtra during the mentioned period is provided in Table B3 and Table B4 , respectively. Furthermore, predicted daily notified cases and deaths under different (20%, 40%, 60% and 80%) lock-down scenario in Maharashtra during the mentioned period is depicted in Fig 3 and Fig 4, respectively. Our predictive study suggest that only 0.1% notified case reduction and (0.3% − 0.5%) death reduction are possible under different lock-down circumstances in Maharashtra (see Table B3 and Table B4 ). Thus, 21 days lock-down will not improve current COVID-19 situation in Maharashtra. For further investigate the lock-down effect in Maharashtra, we estimate the effective reproduction number (R t ) (see Methods section) for the period March, 9 th 2020 till May, 7 th 2020 under different lock-down scenario (no lock-down, 20%, 40%, 60% and 80%). Dynamics of R t under different lock-down situation is depicted in Fig 5. Our result on R t suggest that there may be a decrease in new cases during the lock-down period in Maharashtra (see Fig 5) . However, after the lock-down is over on April, 15 th 2020 a sharp increase in R t indicates that influx of new notified cases will rise again (see Fig 5) . This result further support our claim that lock-down in Maharashtra will not help its current COVID-19 situation. Lock-down scenarios are implemented with success rate 20%, 40%, 60% and 80% respectively. A lock-down success 20% in Maharashtra means that current implemented lock-down will successfully home-quarantine 20% of the total susceptible population. Figure 5 : Effective reproduction number for the period 09/03/2020 till 07/05/2020 in Maharashtra with different lock-down scenario. Yellow interval is current 21 days lock-down period (25/03/2020 till 14/04/2020) in Maharashtra. Lock-down scenarios are implemented with success rate 0%, 20%, 40%, 60% and 80% respectively. Here, 0% lock-down success means no lock-down, and 20% represent current implemented lock-down will successfully home-quarantine 20% of the susceptible population in Maharashtra and similarly for other scenarios. In Delhi, estimate of ρ (see Table B1 in Appendix B) indicates as like Maharashtra here also contribution of asymptomatic infected in COVID-19 new infection is low. Higher value of κ (see Table B1 in Appendix B) indicate that a higher percentage of symptomatic infected in Delhi. However, as estimate of disease transmission rate (β 1 ) is moderate (see Table B1 in Appendix B) therefore there may be lower percentage of super-spreaders in Delhi. Estimate of R 0 in Delhi is provided in Table B5 . Higher value 4.62 (3.70 -5.40) of R 0 (see Table B5 ) in Delhi may be due to presence of high percentage symptomatic infected in the population (see Table B1 in Appendix B). Notified cases as well as deaths in Delhi are predicted for different lock-down situations mentioned earlier (see Method section) staring from March, 17 th 2020 till May, 15 th 2020 (60 days). Predicted total notified cases and deaths under different (no lock-down, 20%, 40%, 60% and 80%) lock-down scenario in Delhi for the mentioned period is provided in Table B3 and Table B4 , respectively. Daily predicted cases and deaths during the mentioned period in Delhi under different lock-down scenario is depicted in Fig 6 and  Fig 7, respectively. Prediction of cases and deaths in Delhi (see Table B3 and Table B4) suggest that (30% -33%) case reduction and (39% -52%) death reduction are possible under different lock-down scenario. Thus, 21 days lock-down in Delhi will be effective and should be extended for few weeks to further case and death reduction. To further investigate the lock-down effect in Delhi, we estimate R t (see Method section) for the period March, 17 th 2020 till May, 15 th 2020 under different lock-down scenario. Time-series of R t for Delhi under different lock-down scenario is depicted in Fig 8. Estimate of R t shows that it fall rapidly during the lock-down period (25/03/2020 till 14/04/2020) and shows some increment after lock-down is over (see Fig 8) . However, R t become saturated and remain below unity after the lock-down period is over (see Fig 8) . This indicates that the number of new notified cases will decrease after the lockdown period (25/03/2020 till 14/04/2020) is over in Delhi. This result further support our claim that 21 days lock-down will be effective in Delhi and should be extended further for more cases and deaths reduction. Lock-down scenarios are implemented with success rate 20%, 40%, 60% and 80% respectively. A lock-down success 20% in Delhi means that current implemented lock-down will successfully home-quarantine 20% of the total susceptible population. Lock-down scenarios are implemented with success rate 0%, 20%, 40%, 60% and 80% respectively. Here, 0% lock-down success means no lock-down, and 20% represent current implemented lock-down will successfully home-quarantine 20% of the susceptible population in Delhi and similarly for other scenarios. In Tamil Nadu, estimate of ρ (see Table B1 in Appendix B) indicate that here asymptomatic infected population contribute higher in producing new COVID-19 cases in compare to Maharashtra and Delhi (see expression of R 0 in equation (2.3) and Table B1 in Appendix B). As percentage of symptomatic infected (see Table B1 in Appendix B) in the population is also very high in Tamil Nadu, therefore, the estimate of R 0 , 8.44 (5.20 -13.23), for Tamil Nadu found out to be much higher than Maharashtra, Delhi and overall India (see Table B5 ). Notified cases and deaths in Tamil Nadu are predicted for different lock-down scenario as mentioned earlier (see Method section) starting from March, 18 th 2020 till May, 16 th 2020 (60 days). Predicted total notified cases and deaths under different (no lock-down, 20%, 40%, 60% and 80%) lock-down situation in Tamil Nadu for the mentioned time duration are provided in Table B3 and Table B4 , respectively. Predicted daily notified cases and deaths for the mentioned time interval under different lock-down circumstances are depicted in Fig 9 and Fig 10, respectively. Predicted cases and deaths in Tamil Nadu (see Table B3 and Table B4 ) suggest that (21% -29%) notified case reduction and (32% -48%) notified death reduction are possible under different lock-down scenario. Therefore, our prediction result suggest that 21 days lock-down in Tamil-Nadu will be effective if it is extended further for few more weeks. For further investigation in lock-down situation in Tamil Nadu, we estimate R t (see Method section) for the time period March, 18 th 2020 till May, 16 th 2020 under different lock-down scenario. Dynamics of R t for Tamil Nadu under different lock-down scenario for the mentioned time duration is depicted in Fig 11. R t falls rapidly during the lockdown period (25/03/2020 till 14/04/2020) and after that it become almost stagnant (below unity). This shows that number of new cases in Tamil Nadu will fall after lockdown period is over. Therefore it is high time to implement few weeks lock-down again in Tamil Nadu after the current lock-down period is over. Figure 9 : Model prediction of Daily COVID-19 cases for the period 18/03/2020 till 16/05/2020 in Tamil Nadu with different lock-down scenario. Yellow interval is the current 21 days lock-down period (25/03/2020 till 14/04/2020) in Tamil Nadu. Lock-down scenarios are implemented with success rate 20%, 40%, 60% and 80% respectively. A lock-down success 20% in Tamil Nadu means that current implemented lock-down will successfully home-quarantine 20% of the total susceptible population. Figure 10 : Model prediction of Daily COVID-19 deaths for the period 18/03/2020 till 16/05/2020 in Tamil Nadu with different lock-down scenario. Yellow interval is the current 21 days lock-down period (25/03/2020 till 14/04/2020) in Tamil Nadu. Lock-down scenarios are implemented with success rate 20%, 40%, 60% and 80% respectively. A lock-down success 20% in Tamil Nadu means that current implemented lock-down will successfully home-quarantine 20% of the total susceptible population. Figure 11 : Effective reproduction number for the period 18/03/2020 till 16/05/2020 in Tamil Nadu with different lock-down scenarios. Yellow interval is the current 21 days lock-down period (25/03/2020 till 14/04/2020) in Tamil Nadu. Lock-down scenarios are implemented with success rate 0%, 20%, 40%, 60% and 80% respectively. Here, 0% lock-down success means no lock-down, and 20% represent current implemented lock-down will successfully home-quarantine 20% of the susceptible population in Tamil Nadu and similarly for other scenarios. Overall in India, estimate of κ (see Table B1 in Appendix B) suggest that there is large number of undetected cases in the population. Furthermore, the estimate of ρ (see R 0 in equation (2.3) and Table B1 in Appendix B) suggest that these large undetected cases contribute a notable amount in producing new COVID-19 cases. Estimate of β 1 (see Table B1 in Appendix B) in overall India found out in resemblance with its values for Delhi and Tamil Nadu. Estimate of the basic reproduction number (R 0 ) for overall India is provided in Table B5 . Notified cases as well as deaths in India are predicted for different lock down situation (see Method section) mentioned earlier starting from March, 2 nd 2020 till May, 7 th 2020 (67 days). Predicted total notified cases and deaths under different lock-down scenario (no-lock-down, 20%, 40%, 60%, and 80%) in India for the mentioned time span are provided in Table B3 and TableB4, respectively. Predicted daily notified cases and deaths in India for the mentioned time duration under different lock-down scenario are depicted in Fig 12 and Fig 13, respectively. Predicted cases and deaths in India (see Table B3 and TableB4) suggest that (0.2% -0.6%) notified case reduction and (0.2% -0.5%) notified death reduction are possible under different lock-down circumstances. Thus, 21 days lock-down will not improve current COVID-19 situation in overall India. To further investigate in this direction, we estimate R t (see Method section) for the time period March, 2 nd 2020 till May, 7 th 2020 under different lock-down scenario. Dynamics of R t under different lock-down scenario for the mentioned time duration is depicted in Fig 14. Dynamics of R t over the mentioned time duration suggest that there may be decrease in new cases during the lock-down period in India. However, sharp increase in R t after the lock-down period indicates that daily notified cases will rise again (see Fig 14) . This result further support our claim that 21 days lock-down will not improve current COVID-19 situation in overall India. Our claim in resemblance with a recent COVID-19 study on overall India [25] . Figure 12 : Model prediction of Daily COVID-19 cases for the period 02/03/2020 till 07/05/2020 in India with different lock-down scenario. Yellow interval is the current 21 days lock-down period (25/03/2020 till 14/04/2020) in India. Lock-down scenarios are implemented with success rate 20%, 40%, 60% and 80% respectively. A lock-down success 20% in India means that current implemented lock-down will successfully home-quarantine 20% of the total susceptible population. Figure 13 : Model prediction of Daily COVID-19 deaths for the period 02/03/2020 till 07/05/2020 in India with different lock-down scenario. Yellow interval is the current 21 days lock-down period (25/03/2020 till 14/04/2020) in India. Lock-down scenarios are implemented with success rate 20%, 40%, 60% and 80% respectively. A lock-down success 20% in India means that current implemented lock-down will successfully home-quarantine 20% of the total susceptible population. Figure 14 : Effective reproduction number for the period 02/03/2020 till 07/05/2020 in India with different lock-down scenarios. Yellow interval is the current 21 days lock-down period (25/03/2020 till 14/04/2020) in India. Lock-down scenarios are implemented with success rate 0%, 20%, 40%, 60% and 80% respectively. Here, 0% lock-down success means no lock-down, and 20% represent current implemented lock-down will successfully home-quarantine 20% of the susceptible population in India and similarly for other scenarios. Up to April, 6 th , 2020, total number of reported COVID-19 cases and deaths in India are 4778 and 136, respectively [5]. This tally rises with few hundred new notified cases every day reported from different locations in India [5]. This is an alarming situation as with a huge population within few days India will enter in stage-3 of COVID-19 transmission. In the absence of neither a effective treatment or vaccine and with an incomplete understanding of epidemiological cycle, predictive mathematical models can help strengthen our understanding of both COVID-19 transmission and control [22] . In this present study, we consider a new mathematical model on COVID-19 transmission that incorporates the lock-down effect. In our model, we also considered transmission variability between symptomatic and asymptomatic population with former being a fast spreader of the disease. Using daily notified cases from three states (Maharashtra, Delhi, and Tamil Nadu) and form whole India, we studied the effect of 21 days lock-down (25/03/2020 till 14/04/2020) on notified cases and deaths reduction in those regions. Our result suggest that Lock-down will have no effect in Maharashtra and overall India. Furthermore, presence of higher percentage of COVID-19 super-spreaders will further deteriorate the situation in Maharashtra. However, for Delhi and Tamil Nadu there is some ray of hope as our prediction shows that lock-down will reduce significant number of notified cases and deaths in these two locations. Further extension of lock-down may place Delhi and Tamil Nadu in a comfort zone. To find the answer of the question why lock-down have some effect in Delhi and Tamil Nadu but no effect on overall India and Maharashtra? We closely look at the parameters sample table for these four locations (see Table B1 ) and found that in Tamil Nadu and Delhi there is a large percentage of symptomatic infected exists in the population. Whereas, in Maharashtra and overall India percentage of symptomatic infected population is very low (see Table B1 ). Thus, there may be a possibility that larger proportion of symptomatic infected in a population can help epidemic curve to reach its peak quickly. To further investigate our claim, we simulate new notified cases for these four locations with mentioned prediction period without any lock-down (see Fig 15) . It can be easily seen from Fig 15, that in Delhi and Tamil-Nadu notified new cases reaches the epidemic peak and whereas for Maharashtra and overall India notified cases slowly increases and still increasing during the mentioned time duration. As new notified cases in Delhi and Tamil Nadu grow faster therefore, 21 days lock-down has some significant impact in reducing cases and deaths in these two locations. Thus, 21 days lock-down may be effective in reducing significant amount of cases and deaths in those location in India where percentage of symptomatic infected population is higher. Finally, we provide a suggestion for the Indian Govt. and Policy makers to do the following steps: 1. An extensive survey to find the percentage of symptomatic infected in different states and regions. "
98482,"The worldwide average R0 value of COVID-19 outside China is estimated at 2.82 for the late Februaryearly March 2020 period, based on a doubling time of 4 days, whereas the value was around 3.83 at the same time in the Western world, based on a doubling time of 2.66 days. This is significantly higher than regular flu viruses. As a result, experience with flu is a poor guide for predicting the course of the COVID-19 epidemic. For instance, flu viruses are seasonal because their R0 tend to drop below 1 over the summer months, but COVID-19 is too contagious to display a similar seasonality. A doubling time of 4 days is consistent with an infection rate k11 of 0.25 day -1 . This value is specific to the current model and should not be applied to other models. It should also not be confused with the apparent growth rate of the virus. Based on the chosen parameter values, the disease intrinsically has a mortality of 1.5 %, which is within the range of estimates that are going around at the time of writing. The WHO proposes a mortality of 3.4 % whereas the mortality in South Korea is 1 % and rising at the time of writing. On the other hand, the mortality in Italy is almost 10 %, probably as a result of underreporting of mild cases and overreporting of deaths attributed to COVID-19. The model predicts that there is 1 death per 700 cases during the growth phase of the epidemic when the doubling time is 4 days, and 1 death per 1700 cases when the doubling time is 2.66 days. With nearly 6000 deaths outside of China as of March 18, this means that the number of infected outside of China is probably on the order of 4 million people, about 30 times the number of reported cases. Assuming a death rate of 1.5 %, a lower limit of 60,000 people outside of China can be expected even if no new infections occur. Irrespective of the variables used, model predictions indicate that COVID-19 will affect vastly more people than expected from ""herd immunity"" considerations. This is because there is a huge number of infected people at the time of onset of herd immunity, enough to infect most of the remaining uninfected people before the epidemic spirals down. It follows that public health strategies based on herd immunity are extremely misguided and extremely deadly. Herd immunity is only effective when the population is vaccinated before the onset of the disease. Likewise, a public health strategy based on ""flattening the curve"" without diminishing R0 below 1 is inadequate and extremely deadly, with an expected mortality rate of about 1 % based on the entire population even with the unrealistic assumption that the healthcare system can handle the number of patients. Once a country takes decisive action to reduce R0 below 1, the mortality still increases by about a factor 55 before the disease is stopped. Based on that number, and assuming that the world's governments take appropriate action at the time of writing, the mortality outside China can be expected to be 330,000. Some governments have already taken decisive action but many have not, so it is very likely that the actual death burden of COVID-19 will be significantly higher. Every four days of delay can be expected to double that number. The mortality of COVID-19 after intervention is very sensitive to the effectiveness of the intervention. For instance, lowering the effectiveness from 65 % to 60 % increases the mortality by a factor 8, from about 55 per million to about 450 per million in the case investigated. Minor gaps in the social distancing policy (e.g., closing bars but allowing private parties), or a small fraction of the population violating the policy can have disastrous effects on mortality rates. Lax enforcement of a social distancing policy could be costly in lives. Calculations with an epidemiological model developed to describe the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic indicates that the mortality of the pandemic will be over 1 % of the global population even if moderate social distances ""flattening the curve"" are imposed. This does not account for overburdening of the healthcare system and associated deaths. Likewise, modeling shows that it is a fatal misconception to assume that ""herd immunity"" can provide even the slightest protection against the virus in the current circumstances. The mortality of COVID-19 can be reduced by up to three orders of magnitude, at least in principle, by reducing R0 below 1 early on in the development of the pandemic. However, failure to meet that objective has a huge impact on mortality, up to 50 % increase for a 1 % decrease in social distancing effectiveness.

98701,"In the first two weeks after declaring the national emergency, the social distancing metrics had changed significantly: more people stayed at home, fewer trips were observed, and travel distance became shorter. However, by the third week of March, the trend of all metrics on social distancing had reached a plateau and remained steadily high for two weeks. We call this phenomenon 'Social Distancing Inertia' (18) . Starting mid-April, the national SDI began to decline. We refer to the phenomenon of shifting from self-restriction to pre-pandemic behavior as ""Quarantine Fatigue"". To check the universality of this increase of physical activities in different states, we have investigated the ROC curve of five day moving average SDI and also the average SDI for the week before and after April 15. Despite the different changes in the confirmed cases per thousand population of each state, we could find a universal decline of SDI for almost all the states in the nation. It shows that people reacted to the nationwide situation of the pandemic not only to the state level conditions. The national quarantine fatigue started around April 15th, before any state had announced reopening policies while the first state to announce reopening was South Carolina by easing restrictions on outdoor and recreation, retail and beauty on April 20th. The universal decline of SDI indicates that on a nationwide level people are going outside more without any states declaring the re-openness. There could be multiple reasons for this phenomenon. One may assume that it is because households must start working on site to pay for the bills and these are essential trips. However, by digging deeper into the data, we could find out more evidence to support the phenomenon of fatigue. After mid-April, the total trips traveled per person increased from 2.75 to 3.0 as seen in figure 3 . Among the 0.25 increase, non-work trips have counted for 80%, changing from 2.3 to 2.5. Therefore, only 20% of the increased trips are work trips and most of the increased travels are non-work trips which don't support the assumption. One may also argue that the fatigue could relate to the upcoming protests over lockdown for states like Michigan (21) . It was true that Michigan residents started the protest on April 15th which coincidentally matched with the start date of the quarantine fatigue nationwide. However, it actually supports our finding that without enforcement, or consistent and effective knowledge propagation of the infectious disease, people tend to get away from the self-isolated voluntary quarantine situation. They would involve themselves in more outdoor activities no matter whether a reopening is announced in the state or not. "
100204,"It is a widely accepted view that COVID 19 is either transmitted via surface contamination or via close contact of an un-infected person with an infected person. Surface contamination usually happens when infected water droplets from exhalation/sneeze/cough of COVID sick person settle on nearby surfaces. To curb this, social distancing and good hand hygiene advise is advocated by World health Organization (WHO). We argue that COVID 19 coronovirus can also be airborne in a puff cloud loaded with infected droplets generated by COVID sick person. An elementary calculation shows that a $5~\mu m$ respiratory infected droplet can remain suspended for about 9.0 minutes and a $2~\mu m$ droplet can remain suspended for about an hour! And social distancing advise of 3 feet by WHO and 6 feet by CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) may not be sufficient in some circumstances as discussed in the text."
100229,"Our analysis reports on effects of the nationwide restrictions of activities, decreased in the electricity generations from the combustible sources, on monthly-, and daily-averaged atmospheric CO 2 concentrations. The results shows that the electricity production for the same period in the years 2018, 2019, and 2020, shrunk at an offset of about 9.20%. This resulted in the modest reduction, e.g., (-1.79%) of the atmospheric CO 2 , and in the December-January, and March, from 414.32 ppm in 2017-2018 periods. It only slightly decreased from the 2018-2019 CO 2 concentrations level, e.g., (413.88 ppm), likely due to the breakthroughs in the renewable energy technologies, and the increased in adoption of the renewable energy sources. A novel feature observed here, is the non-seasonal, and abrupt, but brief atmospheric CO 2 decrease of about 0.85%, in the mid-February 2020, due to the Phase 1 restrictions in China. Hence, the reduction in electricity production is significant on a short-term variability of the atmospheric CO 2 concentrations. It also highlights the significant contributions from China to the atmospheric CO 2 , which suggests that, without the national restrictions of activities, CO 2 concentrations was projected to exceeded that of the year 2019 by 1.79%, but thanks to the severe lockdown, it quickly decreased to the lower level, and sustained the low values for two months successively. The results underscore the atmospheric CO 2 reductions on the monthly time-scale that can be achieved, if the electricity productions from combustible sources were slashed, which could be useful for cost-benefit analyses of the reduction in the electricity production from these combustible sources, and the impact of these reductions on the atmospheric CO 2 concentrations. "
100747,"COVID-19 has spread from China across Europe and the United States and has become a global pandemic. In countries of the Global South, due to often weaker socioeconomic options and health care systems, effective local countermeasures remain debated. We combine large-scale socioeconomic and traffic survey data with detailed agent-based simulations of local transportation to analyze COVID-19 spreading in a regional model for the Nelson Mandela Bay Municipality in South Africa under a range of countermeasure scenarios. The simulations indicate that any realistic containment strategy, including those similar to the one ongoing in South Africa, may yield a manifold overload of available intensive care units (ICUs). Only immediate and the most severe countermeasures, up to a complete lock-down that essentially inhibits all joint human activities, can contain the epidemic effectively. As South Africa exhibits rather favorable conditions compared to many other countries of the Global South, our findings constitute rough conservative estimates and may support identifying strategies towards containing COVID-19 as well as any major future pandemics in these countries."
100764,"The COVID-19 pandemic has led many governments to implement lockdowns. While lockdowns may help to contain the spread of the virus, it is possible that substantial damage to population well-being will result. This study relies on Google Trends data and tests whether the lockdowns implemented in Europe and America led to changes in well-being related topic search terms. Using different methods to evaluate the causal effects of lockdown, we find a substantial increase in the search intensity for boredom in Europe and the US. We also found a significant increase in searches for loneliness, worry and sadness, while searches for stress, suicide and divorce on the contrary fell. Our results suggest that people's mental health may have been severely affected by the lockdown."
101283,"Understanding the dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic is crucial for improved control and social distancing strategies. To that effect, we have employed the susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered model, refined by contact tracing and hospitalization data from Indian provinces Kerala, Delhi, Maharashtra, and West Bengal, as well as from overall India. We have performed a sensitivity analysis to identify the most crucial input parameters, and we have calibrated the model to describe the data as best as possible. Short-term predictions reveal an increasing and worrying trend of COVID-19 cases for all four provinces and India as a whole, while long-term predictions also reveal the possibility of oscillatory dynamics. Our research thus leaves the option open that COVID-19 might become a seasonal occurrence. We also simulate and discuss the impact of media on the dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic."
101456,"The nation-wide lockdown starting 25 March 2020, aimed at suppressing the spread of the COVID-19 disease, was extended until 31 May 2020 in three subsequent orders by the Government of India. The extended lockdown has had significant social and economic consequences and `lockdown fatigue' has likely set in. Phased reopening began from 01 June 2020 onwards. Mumbai, one of the most crowded cities in the world, has witnessed both the largest number of cases and deaths among all the cities in India (41986 positive cases and 1368 deaths as of 02 June 2020). Many tough decisions are going to be made on re-opening in the next few days. In an earlier IISc-TIFR Report, we presented an agent-based city-scale simulator(ABCS) to model the progression and spread of the infection in large metropolises like Mumbai and Bengaluru. As discussed in IISc-TIFR Report 1, ABCS is a useful tool to model interactions of city residents at an individual level and to capture the impact of non-pharmaceutical interventions on the infection spread. In this report we focus on Mumbai. Using our simulator, we consider some plausible scenarios for phased emergence of Mumbai from the lockdown, 01 June 2020 onwards. These include phased and gradual opening of the industry, partial opening of public transportation (modelling of infection spread in suburban trains), impact of containment zones on controlling infections, and the role of compliance with respect to various intervention measures including use of masks, case isolation, home quarantine, etc. The main takeaway of our simulation results is that a phased opening of workplaces, say at a conservative attendance level of 20 to 33\%, is a good way to restart economic activity while ensuring that the city's medical care capacity remains adequate to handle the possible rise in the number of COVID-19 patients in June and July."
101689,"This paper proposes a dynamic SIR model to estimate the impact of various NPIs on the COVID-19 transmission using panel data from 9 countries across the globe. Data from these countries show significant variations in their selections and timelines of the NPIs. Our findings suggest that centralized quarantine is the most effective NPI measure, followed by lockdown, school closure and wearing masks. The scenario analysis shows that lockdown might be cautiously lifted if the country using the other three NPIs simultaneously (school closure, wearing masks and centralized quarantine). Our findings provide feasible solutions for countries to use economically affordable NPIs such as mask wearing and centralized quarantine to replace the highly economically costly NPIs such as national lockdown, without significantly heightening the epidemic peak and can substantially flatten the curve of the active COVID-19 cases to reach a non-epidemic regime. This paper also suggests each country should customize its choice of NPIs by considering specific socioeconomic situations within the country. In particular, our empirical findings suggest that, as of April 4th, Singapore and the U.S. might consider imposing stricter NPIs, while European countries may cautiously consider to gradually lift the policies after reaching the turning points in a few days. We are aware that there are likely undetected cases in the population, for instance because the testing capacity is limited and individual has no symptoms, which may cause potential issues such as the second-wave of the epidemic after the control policy is lifted. It is possible to calibrate such effect by ongoing random testing of the population in the SIR framework [47] . To conclude, the DP-SIR model used with panel data can provide useful insights for countries to choose the most appropriate NPIs in a timely manner to balance the desired goals between the economy performance and health consequence. "
101706,"We have shown estimates of the motion of droplets in the air, depending on droplet size and initial velocities, as they leave the mouth during talking, breathing, sneezing or coughing. Depending on the size of the droplets, which can vary in a wide range, two different models can give useful estimates of the time of persistence of the droplets in quiet air. For droplets larger than ≈ 200 µm, typical of sneezing events, a free fall model is appropriate. They can attain distances of several meters, justifying recommendations for social distancing. On the other side, for droplets of sizes less than ≈ 200 µm, the free fall model is not accurate, and a model of motion in viscous air is necessary. Our results show that typical respiratory droplets with sizes ≤ 10 µm can remain suspended in dry quiet air from several minutes to hours. The time of evaporation of water droplets of sizes as small as 10 µm is much less than a second [25] , leaving droplets nuclei. Then, we conclude that droplet nuclei, which can be suspended in dry air for hours, may be carriers of the virus in quiet air environments, like in a closed room or in an aircraft. Together, these results suggest that airborne transmission of the virus may be a possible mechanism of infection. This also points that the use of masks, even for healthy people,  "
101807,"Both scenarios involve strong mitigations, certainly stronger than current measures already implemented. Both mitigations end the epidemic eventually, around August. But one causes along the way a catastrophic event for the healthcare system, with many potential deaths predicted, and one does not. We note that in both Wuhan and Italy, strong mitigation measures were taken such as lockdown, but they were taken too late and still resulted in thousands of lives lost, including those of healthcare professionals. As the epidemic develops along its inevitable exponential growth trajectory, it is equally inevitable that leadership will eventually be forced to implement lockdown. Thus, if this is going to happen anyway, it should be taken as early as possible. Our calculation shows that the just-in-time scenario accomplishes this and that the window for such a strong mitigation will soon be closed. Of course, one cannot be sure that the dates and course of the epidemic are going to follow the precise predictions we have made. There are inevitable uncertainties in making predictions for such a powerful phenomenon as an epidemic. However, whether the outcomes predicted by our scenarios occur on exactly the dates given here, and with exactly the numbers provided here, they will occur as we have predicted. The window that we have predicted is rather short, perhaps two weeks at the longest. Thus to be safe, the mitigation measures should be implemented as soon as possible, while they will be effective; at the same time, for humanitarian reasons, the societal implications of lockdown require appropriate arrangements to be made for the city's population, as has already done for the mitigation efforts to date. "
102080,"The paper introduced a mesoscopic model of contagion spread based on mixing domains. The model breaks down the venues, where people meet, and relates virus transmissibility to the availability of these venues, manipulated by social distancing policies. Since individuals in this model move from venue to venue, they create mixing across them. To err on the safe side, we assumed that mixing (among domains that remain open) is perfect. The results show that the resulting simplified model is nevertheless capable of accurately predicting changes in the contagion time series. "
102221,"The analysis performed identified a strong reduction of the mobility and transport activities coherently to what has been described by Google Global mobility report and in addition putting in evidence a number of detailed aspects that could allow us to better judge the impact of the reopening on an eventual revamping of the infection. To this end, the collected data from the field have been compared from those of google and some considerations with respect to the Imperial college Report 20 have been derived. It is probably too early to derive conclusions since this report has been written the 6 th of May, only 2 days after the formal reopening. The resulting traffic volume has been repristinated to more than the 50%, which is a +30% with respect to the lockdown situations. For parking, we still have to see an increment of their usage with respect to the lockdown conditions. As regard the environmental variable and thus or air quality the amount of pollutant has been strongly reduced by the lockdown. The largest reductions have been recorded for NO2 (also due to the reduction of traffic), CO, PM10 and CO2 for the reduction of human activities. "
102277,"Until a vaccine or therapy is found against the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, reaching herd immunity appears to be the only mid-term option. However, if the number of infected individuals decreases and eventually fades only beyond this threshold, a significant proportion of susceptible may still be infected until the epidemic is over. A containment strategy is likely the best policy in the worst case where no vaccine or therapy is found. In order to keep the number of newly infected persons to a minimum, a possible strategy is to apply strict containment measures, so that the number of susceptible individuals remains close to herd immunity. Such an action is unrealistic since containment can only last for a finite amount of time and is never total. In this article, using a classical SIR model, we determine the (partial or total) containment strategy on a given finite time interval that maximizes the number of susceptible individuals over an infinite horizon, or equivalently that minimizes the total infection burden during the curse of the epidemic. The existence and uniqueness of the optimal strategy is proved and the latter is fully characterized. If applicable in practice, such a strategy would lead theoretically to an increase by 30% of the proportion of susceptible on an infinite horizon, for a containment level corresponding to the sanitary measures put in place in France from March to May 2020. We also analyze the minimum intervention time to reach a fixed distance from herd immunity, and show the relationship with the previous problem. Simulations are provided that illustrate and validate the theoretical results."
102415,"In this brief article, it is investigated how predictive control, optimizationbased procedures could be used to formulate social isolation guidelines for the COVID-19 pandemic in Brazil, taking into account the spread of the virus in the states of Bahia and Santa Catarina. Centralized and distributed MPC approaches based on SIRD models with parameters identified via Least-Square optimization were proposed in this work. The results indicate that strong quarantine/lockdown measures still have to be enacted for some months before any relaxations can be though of. Below, we summarize some key points: • The results corroborate the hypothesis formulated in Hellewell et al. (2020) and previously discussed in Morato et al. (2020) , which indicate that herd immunity cannot be considered as plausible solution for Brazil, offering great risk and leading to elevated fatality due to multiple social-economical issues of the country. • The control results show that a centralized, coordinated federal government action is necessary to set guidelines to the states, which can performed individual optimization procedures to determine when to relax quarantine measures. A forecast is presented which indicates that a coordinated social isolation public policy could save over 100000 lives in just in these two states. • The SARS-CoV-2 contagion is an inherently complex phenomenon and is influenced by many factors and exact prediction of the future dynamics is not possible and, therefore, the quantitative results presented herein cannot be account for without taking into account the uncertainty margins. Anyhow, the qualitative results are strong. The most correct control procedure should be based on a recurrent (daily) model tuning and re-calculation of the control law. Since the country as been experiencing an unwillingness to formally start harder social isolation measures (The Lancet, 2020), the social and economic costs of the pandemic might be brutal. "
102417,"In this Section, we present simulation forecasts using the SIRDC/SIRASDC with parameters identified in Section 3. The following results were obtained with the aid of Matlab software, Yalmip toolbox and BNB solver. In the sequel, the baseline threshold in the I S curves represent the number of available ICU beds in the country (see Figure 2 ). The maximal threshold stands for an incremented number of ICUs (twice the baseline value), accounting for field hospitals and emergency ICUs that have been made specifically for the COVID-19 pandemic. The following control results were obtained considering the SIRASD models (Nominal, Uncertain 1 and Uncertain 2), as presented in Section 3. Before presenting the actual results, we must affirm that the forecasts and arguments that we present in the sequel should not understood by the reader as incontrovertible truths. These forecast are model-based simulations which depend on a number of factors and initial conditions. Furthermore, we must stress that we have aggregated the whole set of Brazilian data in order to provide a general view of the country. However, if anyone intends to use the proposed method to help the formulation of public health policies, we suggest its application to datasets of smaller regions, that share the same hospital chain. We note, as illustrated in Figure 2 , that different regions of the country are facing different levels of the pandemic. As evidenced in Section 3, the used models grasp the behaviors the SARS-CoV-2 virus dynamics quite accurately, but this does not means that the future predictions are unmistakable. For a fact, we cannot ensure that the social isolation measures will be strictly followed by the population, as we cannot ensure that other factors may come to help ease the spread of the disease (such as vaccines). What we mean by this is that the goal of this work is guide public policies regarding social isolation specially by taking into account the role of uncertainty and sub-notification. Due to the fact that the proposed model cannot exactly predict the pandemic dynamics, to apply some control polcy conceived based on a nominal model may lack conservatism. This could lead to catastrophic results, risking high levels of mortality. Any possible control policy that the government implements through social distancing measures must be based on recurrent (worst-case) model parameter estimations and recalculations of the optimization problem. One cannot use the models derived with the parameters presented in Table 1 as if they would not change along time. The correct measure is to take into account uncertainty-embedded models, performing the identification procedure detailed in Section 3 every day (when new datasets are available). Such adaptive control procedure (with model tuning and model-based control optimization) would be much more prudent, requiring constant measuring, monitoring, parameter estimation and control computations. As discussed by Köhler et al. (2020) , feedback is utterly necessary to ensure a reliable handling of the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak. This is especially critical in Brazil, due to the high level of uncertainty on the datasets. Through the sequel, the dashed lines represent the results with uncertainty (solid dash, Uncertain 1 model; dot dash, Uncertain 2 model), while the solid lines account for nominal conditions. Considering these models, Figure 4 shows the simulation for roughly one year dating from the last data sample (20/03/17), considering a total lockdown condition (u = 1) and a no-isolation (u = 0) case. The first 52 samples represent the known dataset, whereas the following samples stand for predicted data. Clearly, even if a hard isolation is enacted, the Brazilian health system will still face issues with large amounts of COVID-19 patients, with a nominal peak forecast to 26 th of May. The nominal collapse of the healthy system (threshold) dates very soon, May 23. The amount of deaths expected with the uncertain model is unprecedented. Of course, each life matters and 2 million deceased individuals is a lot to bare. Psychological and social traumas will mark the country. A hard isolation could be able to save more than one million lives, taking into account the results achieved with the worst-case uncertainty scenario. With respect to the forecasts presented in Figure 4 , we must also stress that the possibility of herd immunity must be discarded. These results corroborate the conclusions presented by Köhler et al. (2020) , which indicate that neither a complete eradication of the virus nor herd immunity are possible options to attenuate the COVID-19 pandemics without the availability of a vaccine. These results also go along the lines of Hellewell et al. (2020) . Considering control results, the MPC optimization procedure from Eq. (21) is solved for different cases of N m (minimal amount of days in each state: isolation, no isolation). For such, the weighting matrices Q I and Q u are taken to imply an adequate trade-off between peak reduction and social isolation. Since the occupancy rate of ICU beds in the country dating 20/05/08 is considerably high, we chose Q I = 0.9 and Q u = 0.1, which means that the MPC makes ""more effort"" to reduce the amount of infected individuals then to restore a no-isolation policy, which is reasonable considering the observed situation. The control horizon is fixed as N p = 60 days (the MPC makes predictions for two-months ahead of each sampled k, day). Firstly, we show the results for N m = 2, 5 and 7 days of the minimal days in each state condition. The decision by the MPC optimization and the resulting enacted social isolation measure (ψ) are shown in Figure 5 . The resulting effects on the amount of symptomatic individuals is shown in Figure 6 . We must state that, for N m ≤ 7 days, the amount of shifting in the observed social isolation variable is quite intense. Furthermore, the obtained results with these values for N m were not enough to reduce the infection peak, as observed. Note that this kind of policy would hardly ever be implementable, since a confusing message would be passed to the society. The frequent changing between isolation or noisolation would not be strictly followed, which is certainly unwanted. Therefore, these results are not considered as practical or viable. Then, Figure 7 presents the obtained control results for N p = 10, 14, 20, 25, 30, 40 and 60 days, regarding the I S curve. This Figure contains a lot of information, which we try to explain by parts: • If social isolation is not maintained until roughly August 14, even the shortest ""openings"" (days in reduced isolation policies) could be catastrophic. Any possible reduction of the hard social isolation measures, before this date, would result in an infection peak which would surpass the amount of available ICU beds in the country in over seven times (considering the worst-case uncertainty). This is very significant and thus, any possible social isolation reduction should not proceed before the initial infection curve starts to decay (in both nominal and uncertain conditions); • Therefore, smallest peaks of infections occurs if the isolation measure is kept at least until August 14. After this date, when relaxations in these measures are enacted, a second infection peak will certainly appear. This second peak is due to the fact that social isolation is reduced by the MPC law after the decay of I S running from first peak (August 14). This second peak dates roughly October 3. • The second peak of infection is reduced with a smaller number of days in a no-isolation mode. This means that, after August 14, the MPC control action which results in the smallest values for I S are those with, at most, periods of 25 days in the no-isolation mode. The smallest amount of ""open"" periods, better the results, as expected. • Note that as N m increases, this second peak of infection also increases because the amount of minimal days determined for a no-isolation (or reduced-isolation) policy forces a peak increase, which is later treated by a total isolation after its decay. The amount of deaths are given in Figure 9 . Depending on the amount of days in a no-isolation condition, the amount of deaths may range from 0.13 to 1.88 million individuals, according to the uncertain models. Regarding these obtained results, it seems reasonable to us to ponder the following issues: • The uncertain model forecasts quite harsh infection scenarios. Even though the considered uncertainty is quite high (15, 30 times more cases), it offers us a worst-case forecast to determine public policies. With such uncertain model in mind, it seems evident why social distancing measures are so important right now and why they should not be dropped, despite their possible economical side-effects. It seems extremely necessary for public policies to offer alternative solutions to those without jobs or economically suffering due to the social isolation. • No social distancing measures should be relaxed before mid-August (20/08/14). This would definitely help in avoiding the collapse of the Brazilian health system. • If social distancing is to be relaxed, this should not be done before the first infection peak starts to decay (beginning of August) and the no-isolation periods should be the minimal amount of days possible. To ensure heath safety, a conservative measure indicates that such paradigm of recurrent short periods of reduced isolation, followed by hard isolation periods would proceed until roughly 2021/01/21. This paradigm would be helpful to ensure that the SARS-CoV-2 virus does not cause further infection peaks and to mitigate the amount of deaths. The resulting control policies from the MPC procedure, for the different values for N m , are shown in Figure 8 . These curves indicate, roughly, when to determine social isolation measures and when to set them off. In fact, the actual implemented policy would depend on a daily update of the MPC results with measured datasets. Anyhow, these results indicate a forecast of roughly when to determine or call off these measures. The best result, in terms of infections, would be to follow the Social Isolation state until mid-August, an then relax this measure with small periods (that should definitely not surpass 25 days). It seems, mathematically speaking, that even if the SIRASD model has a new degree-of-freedom (which is the decision variable u, to determine when to determine social isolation), the resulting optimization points out that the best option is to maintain isolation for as long as possible. Even if allowing social contact for a while, the optimization finds minima solutions of J for the smallest number of days with contact and, then, once again determines isolation. The COVID-19 is quite worrisome and presents devastating social and economic effects. Biology literature points out that social isolation is necessary. Using mathematical models and optimization, the answer is the same.  In this paper, we investigate an optimization-based solution for social isolation measures of the COVID-19 spread for the Brazilian context. Since recent works have warned against the large order of sub-notification in Brazil, we take uncertainty into account to determine nominal and uncertainty dynamic models of the COVID-19 pandemics. Such uncertainty-embedded models are SIR-kind equations which also consider a new variable, which accounts for the average response of the population to social distancing measures (as determined by the government). A robust Model Predictive Control framework is designed for the regulation of the COVID-19 through the means of such social isolation policies. The MPC is derived as an optimal On-Off social distancing planner. In this paper, we have tried to expose some essential insights regarding subnotification and how possible relaxations of social distancing can be performed in the future. Below, we summarize the main findings of this paper, enlightening the key points: • The presented results corroborate the hypothesis formulated in Hellewell et al. (2020) and also discussed in The Lancet (2020), with respect to the Brazilian scenario: herd immunity cannot be considered a plausible solution, offering great risk and leading to elevated fatality. Furthermore, as illustrate Silva et al. (2020) ; Rocha Filho et al. (2020); Rodriguez-Morales et al. (2020), vertical isolation is also not an option for the time being, since we do not have the means to formulate an efficient public policy to separate the population at risk from those with reduced risk, due to multiple social-economical issues of the country. • Since the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus is inherently complex and varies according to multiple factors (some which are possibly unmodelled and external), exact prediction of the pandemic dynamics is not possible. Therefore, the correct control procedure should be based on a recurrent (daily) model tuning and re-calculation of the control law, always taking into account the uncertainty margins. • The simulation forecasts found through the MPC optimization procedure, which accounts for the uncertainty in the spread of the disease, indicate that, at least for now, only one answer is available: maintain social isolation for as long as possible, without relaxing it before mid August 2020. This is a rather strict suggestion, but seems to be the sole possible way to attenuate the (already high) levels of the virus in Brazil. The forecasts also indicate a prediction for the infection peak in the country dating very soon, May 26, with a second (and larger) peak possibly arising in October. The control policy, in terms of social isolation, shows that relaxations (loosening the isolation measures) should be performed in, at most, periods of 25 days of reduced-isolation, after the first infection peaks has passed, until roughly January 2021. Synthetically, we must stress that this paper presents only qualitative results of how an optimization-based On-Off strategy can be formulated regarding the COVID-19 spread, regarding the Brazilian context. Since the country as been experiencing an unwillingness to formally start harder social isolation measures The Lancet (2020), the social and economic costs of the pandemic might be brutal. The Authors hope that the proposition herein formalised can serve to help determining adequate public health policies from now on. "
102910,"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) global pandemic has led many countries to impose unprecedented lockdown measures in order to slow down the outbreak. Questions on whether governments have acted promptly enough, and whether lockdown measures can be lifted soon have since been central in public discourse. Data-driven models that predict COVID-19 fatalities under different lockdown policy scenarios are essential for addressing these questions and informing governments on future policy directions. To this end, this paper develops a Bayesian model for predicting the effects of COVID-19 lockdown policies in a global context -- we treat each country as a distinct data point, and exploit variations of policies across countries to learn country-specific policy effects. Our model utilizes a two-layer Gaussian process (GP) prior -- the lower layer uses a compartmental SEIR (Susceptible, Exposed, Infected, Recovered) model as a prior mean function with""country-and-policy-specific""parameters that capture fatality curves under""counterfactual""policies within each country, whereas the upper layer is shared across all countries, and learns lower-layer SEIR parameters as a function of a country's features and its policy indicators. Our model combines the solid mechanistic foundations of SEIR models (Bayesian priors) with the flexible data-driven modeling and gradient-based optimization routines of machine learning (Bayesian posteriors) -- i.e., the entire model is trained end-to-end via stochastic variational inference. We compare the projections of COVID-19 fatalities by our model with other models listed by the Center for Disease Control (CDC), and provide scenario analyses for various lockdown and reopening strategies highlighting their impact on COVID-19 fatalities."
103076,"The results showed that the improvements in statistics related to social distancing were smaller than expected. They also showed that the trends reached a plateau after about two weeks. Even though all aspects of our results are suggesting the inertia, they cannot prove that people are not conforming with social distancing orders. One can still argue that the remaining trips are essential trips; or people that are not staying home are essential workers or are people traveling for their essential needs. However, digging deeper can provide further evidence suggesting inertia. The drop in the number of work trips per person was about 50%, which shows that even amid the pandemic, about 50% of people are going to their routine work place. The drop in number of nonwork trip was limited to 22%, suggesting that people have not significantly decreased their nonwork trip rate. One may argue that the nature of the non-work trips happening amid pandemic may be different from the non-work trips happening before, and the trips amid pandemic may be short walks in the neighborhood. However, looking into the drop in average miles traveled per person, the national drop is limited to 40%. We can see that people are still traveling significant miles. A recent analysis of PlaceIQ data during pandemic showed that foot traffic to groceries has only decreased 27% 27 . Altogether, the result suggest that a significant part of the nation is showing inertia toward social distancing. Social distancing is very important to slow down the spread of COVID-19. However, performing social distancing is quite different from peoples' habitual behavior. Social distancing policy clashes with the deep-seated human instinct to connect with others in order to regulate emotions, cope with stress, and remain resilient during difficult times 28, 29 . Therefore, without enforcement, incentives, or proper knowledge about the risks involved, people have an inertia to keep their habitual behavior. Even though staying home may help prevent disease spread, people tend to repeat previous behaviors 30 . The inertia is common in other aspects of human behavior. In stock market, investors who missed an opportunity to leave a 'bear market' are less likely to sell their stocks at a later opportunity 31 . In consumer purchase decisions, customers showing inertia refrain from making new purchase 32 . In travel behavior, travelers are more likely to stick to their habitual mode, routes and departure time [33] [34] [35] . The inertia is also observed in the studies of disease spread and prevention. The influence of inertia is even considered in some SIR models 36 . In a pandemic study focused on the Spanish Flu, the cognitive inertia has been shown as a main reason for the lack of preparation among unaffected areas (Dicke, 2015). The study suggested that cognitive inertia grew from the traditional view that seasonal flu would run for a brief period, and has no threat on healthy group. A recent paper by an infectious disease research team showed the existence of inherent inertia toward social distancing through a game theory model, and stated the important role of national public statements in overcoming the social distancing inertia 37 . Our study provided evidence from observed data on this phenomenon. Answering why such inertia exists is outside the scope of this paper. A future paper can dig deeper and study device-level results to further investigate inertia and learn more about possible causes. Such analysis needs to conform with privacy rules and regulations. "
103144,"Alternating-lock-downs offer a sustainable strategy to overcome COVID-19. It allows to continue the socio-economic activity at a 50% rate, while mitigating the spread. We designed our strategy under the assumption of imperfect social compliance [11] , allowing a defection fraction of f . We believe, however, that the weekly relief, allowing people an outlet to continue and be active half of the time, may, itself, increase cooperation levels. Indeed, while a complete lock-down is extremely stressful for the individual, the bi-weekly routine offered here relaxes the burden, and may encourage compliance. This also provides a degree of freedom to allow a certain level of authorized defection, i.e. a quota of essential workers that can be relived from the lock-down periods. In practice, we believe that the simplest implementation can be by regulating schools and workplaces. Each house-hold will be informed on its lock-down/active schedule, and in parallel workplaces and schools will only be allowed to operate in weekly fully partitioned shifts. Under such regulations the strategy has little dependence on social cooperation, as schools and employment will naturally drive the population between activity and inactivity. The only enforcement of the lock-down that will still be required is for recreational activities, beyond school and work. We believe that the pressure to defect for such activities is lower, and hence overall defection levels can be sustained well within the bounds of successful mitigation. Our analysis assumes an incubation period that is of the order of a single week, specifically in our simulations, we set it at an average of 5 days. The rationale however is more general, and can be adapted to longer or shorter incubation times, simply by tuning the periodicity of the lock-down shifts, keeping them congruent with the natural cycle of the disease. More broadly, we consider the fact that there is, inherently, some level of uncertainty regarding the disease parameters. We therefore assumed a worst case scenario, in which the infection rate during the active weeks is the same as that of the unmitigated spread. In practice, however, we expect many additional measures to be implemented in parallel to the lock-downs, such as extended testing for infections, and strict hygienic regulations at the workplace. At the least, we expect standard prophylactic behavior, such as avoiding contact or banning social gatherings, to be observed also during each group's active week. Such norms, that will continue until COVID-19 is fully mitigated, will further push down β, enhancing the effectiveness of our strategy even under higher f or σ. Alternating lock-downs offers an additional crucial advantage, that, again -assuming worst case -we did not exploit in our simulations. Indeed, the fact that at each time point only half of the population is active, is, itself, an enhancer of prophylactic norms. With classrooms, public transport, offices and marketplaces at only half capacity, it becomes more natural to maintain social distancing, and reduce infectious interactions. Hence, our partition will further push down the infection rate β, likely leading to an even better performance than reported in Fig. 2 . Our simulation results are based on a simplistic SEIR model, potentially overlooking much of the complexity and irregularity characterizing the spread in a real social setting. Moreover, while our modeling covers the epidemiological aspects of the strategy, it cannot advise on its practical implementation or on its economical viability. Finally, tested against real-time data of, e.g., human mobility, will enable further fine-tuning of the proposed strategy. For example, partitioning into more groups, if possible, allowing extended activity periods, or changing the schedule from weekly to, e.g., 10 days, etc. • Therefore, we do not call for the immediate implementation of alternating lock-downs. We do, however, think that the potential merits of this scheme warrant its consideration as a leading strategy for mitigation of COVID-19. As we communicate this idea -we invite critique, and further examination of its applicability, and especially, call for testing it against real-time human interaction data, to fine-tune its implementation and assess its effectiveness. Data availability. All codes to reproduce, examine and improve our proposed analysis are available at . f under different intervention times t 0 (blue -red gradient). We observe a transition, in which for f < 0.17 the disease is eliminated. Beyond this defection rate, spread is suppressed, but not fully eliminated, i.e. flattened. (f) Similar results for I Peak vs. f . (g) Duration T vs. f . For small f the mitigation is rapid (elimination). For large f , however, the overall duration is increased -an inevitable price of flattening the curve. (h) -(j) We measured the three parameters vs. the variability in incubation times σ. We find that our strategy is highly insensitive to σ, however for σ > 5, a rather extreme level of variability, duration becomes highly extended. "
103460,"This paper assesses the effects of policies on the spread of Covid-19 in the US using the US state-level data on cases, tests, policies, and social distancing behavior measures from Google Mobility Reports. Our findings are summarized as follows. First, our empirical analysis indicates that mandating face masks have reduced the spread of Covid-19 without affecting people's social distancing behavior measured by Google Mobility Reports. Our counterfactual experiment based on the estimated model indicates that, if all states had have adopted mandatory face mask policy on April 1st of 2020, then the number of cases in late-May would have been smaller by 30 to 57 percent, potentially saving tens of thousands of lives. Second, we find that the impact of all policies combined on case growth is quite large, reducing the growth rate of cases by 60 percent. Except for mandatory face mask policy, the effect of all other policies on case growth is realized through their impact on social distancing behavior. Our counterfactual experiment shows that, had all policies have been removed from all states, there would have been 10 to 100 million additional cases by late-May, suggesting that policy makers should be careful about removing all policies together. Third, we find that people voluntarily reduce their visits to workplace, transit, grocery, and transits when they receive information on a higher number of new cases. This suggests that individuals make decisions to voluntarily limit their contact with others in response to greater transmission risks, leading to an important feedback mechanism to future cases. As our counterfactual experiments illustrate, model simulations that ignore this people's voluntary behavioral response to information on transmission risks would over-predict the future number of cases. Beyond these findings, our paper presents a useful conceptual framework to investigate the relative roles of policies and information on determining the spread of Covid-19 through their impact on people's behavior. Our causal model allows us to explicitly define counterfactual scenarios to properly evaluate the effect of alternative policies on the spread of Covid-19, and can be used to quantitatively examine various Covid-19 related issues for future research. "
103977,"We apply the SIR model to study the spread of a disease in a partially overlapped multiplex network composed of two layers, in which a fraction q of individuals belong to both layers and also each layer has its own distribution of contact times. We propose a social distancing strategy that reduces the average contact time of the interactions between individuals within each layer, by increasing its respective disorder intensity. When the disorder intensity in a layer is below its critical value for q = 0 (the isolated-layer case), an epidemic cannot be avoided, even when the individuals in the other layer are completely isolated. However, we find that it is still possible to protect the functional network of susceptible individuals through social distancing policies, i.e., by increasing the disorder intensity. This is fundamental to keep running the economy of a society. In the best case scenario, when the disorder intensity in a layer is above its critical value for q = 0, we find that there is a critical disorder intensity in the other layer that can reduce the epidemic size to zero. All the critical values increase with the overlapping q because the individuals that are shared by the layers ease the spread of disease, so that more social distancing measures must be undertaken to prevent an epidemic. All in all, the control of contact times between individuals can serve as a prevention strategy that overcomes the overlapping effect in multiplex networks, preventing not only an epidemic, but also the economic collapse of a region or country, which might be equally bad. "
104171,"In this study, a network model is utilized for studying the dynamics of infection spreading through a population. Here, we have used a random graph that solves the SIR model using parameters relevant for COVID-19. Furthermore, the SIR random network model has been extended to include the effect of mitigation strategies lockdown and testing. The network model including lockdown/test measure is then used to investigate the dynamics of epidemic growth in the mitigated system. In addition, using the developed models, we carry out three studies concerning the spread of infection in real systems (South Korea, Germany and New York) which utilize lockdown and testing measures for controlling the spread. We show that the network model including lockdown and testing measure preforms reasonably well in predicting the spread of COVID-19 in the real system studies. The lockdown measure is implemented by forcing the nodes to get isolated with a prespecified probability; with probability one, the system is considered to be complete lockdown where the randomly picked nodes definitely isolated themself. The study of epidemic growth in a system under lockdown reveals a large peak in the number of infectious, similar to the uncontrolled dynamics, if the probability of the lockdown implementation is low (e.g. 25%). For implementations with large probabilities (e.g., 75% or larger), the number of infected at the peak can become as large as that of an uncontrolled system if the lockdown is lifted and there is a second outbreak. The lockdown implementation with 50% presents an optimal scenario in which there is a second outbreak and two peaks of equal amplitudes develop. However, at about 10% of the population, the number of infected at the peaks can still be quite large. We also show that there is a second outbreak after the lockdown is withdrawn, which depends on the number of infected at the end of the lockdown period. If the number of susceptible is considerably larger than the herd immunity value then the system remain at the risk of the second outbreak, especially when the system can be reinfected due to outside interaction. The testing measure relies on the ability to identify the infectious as well as the asymptomatic in the population. The implementation depends on the finding of the contagious nodes with the effectiveness of testing and completely isolating them. We find that testing with effectiveness greater than 50% works reasonable well for controlling the spread, and the peak in the infectious curve forms only at a slightly higher value than the level at which the measure is introduced. Beyond the peak value, the infectious curve starts dropping and if the mitigation is maintained long enough, the infection can be completely eradicated from the system. However, as we observed in case of lockdown, the system under testing remains at the risk of the second outbreak if a large number of susceptible exist in the population, especially when there is an outside interaction and any further testing is stopped. Although both lockdown and testing rely on modifying the interaction between two individuals, it is essential to understand the underlying differences. For implementing the lockdown, no prior knowledge of the infected is required and all individuals are isolated, regardless of their status -susceptible, infectious or recovered. Thus, the mitigation measure can be implemented easily and quickly without deploying large resources. For testing to be effective, one needs to establish facilities that can identify enough number of infected among a pool of potential spreader of the infection. Therefore, considerable effort and resources are required for implementing testing. Furthermore, testing is likely to perform better than lockdown in terms of compliance from the members of the population. In lockdown, all individuals are treated exactly the same, and regardless of their status as infectious, susceptible or recovered are kept in isolation. For this reason, the mitigation measure is likely to suffers from the lack of compliance by the members of the population, especially when the implementation drags for a long time period. Testing, on the other hand, identifies and isolates the infected and those who are likely to catch the infection. Thus, only the potential spreads are affected, which makes the population's compliance possible to a large extent. Also, with testing the adverse effect on the economy and social lives of the people can be managed better. Finally, we note that eliminating an infection as contagious as COVID-19 is difficult, primarily because the world populations are highly connected. Any remnant of the infections anywhere in the world has the potential to reignite the spread if the population has not acquire the herd immunity. Therefore, the goal is to reach the herd immunity, either through a vaccine or through the spread, preferably controlled. In the latter case, one needs to control the spread to a level that the increase in the infectious can be handled effectively by the local health-care facilities; at the same time, the number of the recovered is allowed to increase, ultimately attaining the herd immunity. Hence, the mixed strategies including both lockdown and testing will be useful in near-future. Various countries have used this approach; however, they differ in the many aspects such as the time to initiate the mitigations, lockdown period, the effectiveness of testing, etc. We have made the numerical comparison of a mixed mitigation scheme on the three very different state, all with very different mitigation strategies. Interestingly, with a very simplified model, we are able to reproduce the growth of the epidemic of these countries. Our study suggest that the resurgence in South Korea and Germany is controlled due to high efficient testing after opening and so New York should follow the same. At this time, most of the countries are opening, and there might be a resurgence of the epidemic (also seen in Germany simulation when we decrease the testing efficiency). These comparative studies over real data give us a rough estimate of the combined effect of lockdown and testing. Thus similar studies using realistic models will be useful to gain insights of the epidemic spread. "
104325,"Motivated by the need for novel robust approaches to modelling the Covid-19 epidemic, this paper treats a population of $N$ individuals as an inhomogeneous random social network (IRSN). The nodes of the network represent different types of individuals and the edges represent significant social relationships. An epidemic is pictured as a contagion process that changes daily, triggered on day $0$ by a seed infection introduced into the population. Individuals' social behaviour and health status are assumed to be random, with probability distributions that vary with their type. First a formulation and analysis is given for the basic SI (""susceptible-infective"") network contagion model, which focusses on the cumulative number of people that have been infected. The main result is an analytical formula valid in the large $N$ limit for the state of the system on day $t$ in terms of the initial conditions. The formula involves only one-dimensional integration. Next, more realistic SIR and SEIR network models, including""removed""(R) and""exposed""(E) classes, are formulated. These models also lead to analytical formulas that generalize the results for the SI network model. The framework can be easily adapted for analysis of different kinds of public health interventions, including vaccination, social distancing and quarantine. The formulas can be implemented numerically by an algorithm that efficiently incorporates the fast Fourier transform. Finally a number of open questions and avenues of investigation are suggested, such as the framework's relation to ordinary differential equation SIR models and agent based contagion models that are more commonly used in real world epidemic modelling."
104374,"For the description of a pandemic mathematical models could be interesting. Both for physicians and politicians as a base for decisions to treat the disease. The responsible estimation of parameters is a main issue of mathematical pandemic models. Especially a good choice of $\beta$ as the number of others that one infected person encounters per unit time (per day) influences the adequateness of the results of the model. For the actual COVID-19 pandemic some aspects of the parameter choice will be discussed. Because of the incompatibility of the data of the Johns-Hopkins-University to the data of the German Robert-Koch-Institut we use the COVID-19 data of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) as a base for the parameter estimation. Two different mathematical methods for the data analysis will be discussed in this paper and possible sources of trouble will be shown. As example of the parameter choice serve the data of the USA and the UK. The resulting parameters will be used estimated and used in W.\,O. Kermack and A.\,G. McKendrick's SIR model. Strategies for the commencing and ending of social and economic shutdown measures are discussed. The numerical solution of the ordinary differential equation system of the modified SIR model is being done with a Runge-Kutta integration method of fourth order. At the end the applicability of the SIR model could be shown essentially. Suggestions about appropriate points in time at which to commence with lockdown measures based on the acceleration rate of infections conclude the paper."
104879,"Lockdown has reduced both the number of infections and the spread. The propagation focused in the Eastern half and kept the West intact. Without lockdown, the whole country would be affected and more severely. Lockdown caused a significant reduction of the reproduction number, from 3.42 to 0.38. Since the number of susceptible individuals remain large, as soon as contacts increase, the effective reproduction number R eff grows and can exceed 1. With a lack of treatment, social distancing remains the most effective means. We notice that it has to be highly respected (here at over 63%). As shown in Figure 6 -A, the number of symptomatic infected individuals, therefore potentially hospitalized, is restrained as soon as at least 63% of the individuals respect the distancing, Nevertheless, this constraint can be relaxed since it can be imposed only in the most infectious areas. In summary, to obtain a possible unlockdown map, the local value of the effective reproduction number should be taken into account, as well as the number of infected individuals and the direction of the spread of the disease. Of course, this is a simplified model based only the population density and mean daily commuting. For example, the model could be improved by considering a larger diffusion along major axes of travel (i.e. d = d(x, t)), by taking local effects of distancing (e.g η = η(x, t) where η(x, t) = 0 in closed schools), or by opening of the frontiers (by changing the boundary conditions and adding new recruits).

105037,"Our research interest revolves around the correlations among the psychological aspects of international students, their satisfaction over the university, their social capital and the use of the most dominant social media platforms. Especially for the psychological aspects, we focused on common issues that students may confront such as anxiety, loneliness and depression. Furthermore, the lockdown due to the coronavirus pandemic crisis brought to the fore stress issues that the students may feel, especially those living thousands of miles away from their countries and therefore their comfort zones. Universities, as suggested by the results of this study, can be one of the most crucial inhibitors for this category of stress or anxiety. Loneliness, anxiety, or depressionor lately, the COVID-19-related stress psychological aspectscan be seriously lowered down if the host institutions provide moral and psychological support to the students. Together with that, social capital, digital friends and university colleagues can be beneficial. "
105130,"Mathematical modeling can provide tools to better understand epidemic dynamics and can vary from purely theoretical to more data driven and predictive [26] . While a simple model such as this one should not be used to make large-scale policy recommendations, it can provide a framework for specific hypothesis testing. Also, our model may be applicable to social networks of smaller size exhibiting small world characteristics, such as seen in college settings [32] . Here we use the model to ask several specific questions about how different behaviors might impact population infection rates. We specifically examine three main actions that can be taken to curb the SARS-CoV-2 spread: 1) government imposed social distancing; 2) behaviorally induced social isolation following virus exposure and 3) infection rate reduction, e.g. through behavioral adaptation through PPE or increased hand-washing and disinfecting. Early in the pandemic, government imposed social distancing was the primary tool used to slow infection rates or as commonly described ""flatten the curve"" [1] . Actions taken are quite varied and there is generally no uniform agreement about how much social distancing is necessary to significantly slow SARS-CoV-2 transmission. To examine the full potential for social distancing we examine a wide range of possible scenarios varying from no official social distancing to extreme social distancing (90%). While the two extreme scenarios are easy to envision (zero social distancing is business as usual and 90% is all but non-essential businesses closed), more moderate social distancing scenarios are harder to translate into direct societal actions. Nevertheless, we find a clear phase transition with social distancing in our small-world models. In general, social distancing compliance below 65% results in a wide-spread outbreak, while social distancing compliance above 75% contains the virus to low levels. For our secondary simulations over a refined parameter space, in the absence of stringent individual social distancing responses we observe that there is a phase transition that occurs as the percentage of agents socially distancing changes from 73% to 74%. While it is difficult to relate these transitions to specific policies that may be put in place, it is apparent that aggressive social distancing policies are required to contain an outbreak. Moreover, social distancing measures that allow for more inter-agent contact will likely allow rampant viral spread. In addition to government actions, individual behavior taken during the pandemic can greatly affect the dynamics of the pandemic. Most governments have issued guidelines for social isolation if in contact with a diseased individual. The most commonly recommended guideline is 14 days of self-isolation to avoid exposing other individuals [6, 8, 10] . However, despite these official guidelines, self-isolation following exposure requires that infected individuals inform their contacts and that exposed individuals voluntary comply. Given these caveats, we wanted to understand how self-isolation following an infected symptomatic social contact would influence final disease progression. In this model, self-imposed social distancing occurs only on the days when the agent has sufficiently many symptomatic contacts in the network. Thus, our model incorporates self-imposed social distancing as highly responsive to an agent's short-term perceptions regarding infection risks within their community. Interestingly, for self-isolation to negatively impact the number of infections, an extreme level of responsiveness was needed by the agents involved. In our model, it was necessary for self-isolation to occur following exposure to only one infected agent. If self-isolation occurred following the symptomatic infection of two or more contacts, the effect on viral spread was minimal. Given the high number of asymptomatic infected people with SARS-CoV-2 [15, 27] , it is likely that many individuals who have come in contact with an infected individual are not aware of their exposure. Our findings also highlight the well-known fact that contact tracing following an individual's positive test is critical for limiting the spread of the infection [4] . Individuals responsiveness to recommended government actions are highly variable [6] . One control measure to decrease the virus spread is wearing a mask in public [21] . While this behavior is widely adopted in Asian countries that had experience with prior epidemics, it was much slower to catch on in Western  Fig 7. Social Distance Probability and Viral Shedding. Social distance probability vs. viral shedding, with social distance threshold and length of epidemic indicated by color and size. Longer outbreaks occur with low social distance probability and high viral shedding rates. countries [21, 28] . Mask wearing can significantly reduce viral shedding since individuals wearing a mask have a reduced chance of passing the virus on to others. Yet this policy remains controversial and adoption of mask wearing has been highly variable [30, 31] . Mask wearing in our model is captured by viral shedding. In our model, if the viral shedding rate is very small, then the epidemic does not spread, With moderate rate of viral shedding, the social distance threshold at which someone decides to self-isolate after coming into contact with an infected individual becomes much more important. In our model, if the social distance threshold is set to 1 (agents self-isolate after coming into contact with at least one infected agent), then the final total infection rate in the population is approximately 12%. However, if the behaviorally induced social distancing does not take place or takes place at a higher threshold, then the final infection is much larger with the overall infection rate in the population approximately 62%. Finally, when the viral shedding in our model was set at a high level of 25% (simulating a comparatively more infectious disease), the government imposed social distancing was required to be greater than 80% to control the outbreak, resulting in an approximately 1% infection rate in the population. Other less stringent social distancing conditions result in a viral infection rate between 25% and 97.5%. Although not prescriptive, the analysis of our simple agent-based model on synthetic networks provides strong evidence for generalizations. Social distancing controls in this model exhibit a sharp phase transition regarding total number of infections, either when imposed at a large scale by government mandates or when based on individual response to infected contacts. Our models suggest that in order to be effective, mandatory social distancing such as stay-at-home orders need to be broadly applied across all segments of society with a high degree of adherence by individuals. Alternatively, self-isolation must be immediately enacted if a social contact is known to be infected. Finally, if it is possible to reduce viral shedding through adherence to mask wearing, then the size of the final infected population can be significantly reduced. Supporting information S1 File.

105312,"A SEIR type compartmental model is proposed to study the current scenario of COVID-19 in Italy. Our proposed model accurately fits the officially available data of the pandemic in Italy. Also, it is concluded from the study that the pandemic may still grow in Italy till 30 th April, 2020. The pandemic may hit the 2.5 lacks active cases mark (see fig. 3 ) in Italy. Also, we have discussed how the lock down that was imposed on 9 th March, 2020 was a good but a delayed decision of the government of Italy. Through simulations, we have shown that a rapid isolation of the infective individuals and early lock down in the country are two of the most efficient procedures to terminate the spread of COVID-19. As of now, the vaccination of COVID-19 have not been discovered. Hence, this research can also be beneficial for the countries which are in the initial stage of the pandemic, as our research describes two of the most effective procedures to counter the spread of the pandemic and its long term impact on the spread of disease. The expression of the basic reproduction number R 0 is also derived. As our proposed model involves various parameters, we have shown the sensitivity of these parameters via numerical simulations. It is clear from the simulations (see Fig. 10d ) that the transmission rates, β and β 0 are the most sensitive parameters. The reproduction number can be minimized if we can reduce these two parameters. "
105368,"This paper has introduced a variant of the SEIR model for epidemics added with Social Distancing in which the social distancing value is variable over time, and has described how this model can be coupled with Differential Evolution for the individuation of its most suitable parameter values. The resulting mechanism has been applied to model the spreading of the coronavirus Covid-19 in Italy and in two of its most important regions, i.e., Lombardy and Campania. Consequently, we have been able to evaluate the evolution over time of the daily number of infectious cases from today until the end of virus spreading. This has allowed us to estimate the day(s) in which this number will be at its highest peak, as well as the day in which the infected cases will become very close to zero. The above results hold true if the current social distancing is strictly kept in next weeks. We hope this study can serve as a useful guideline to Italian Government as well to the Government of any other State in which Covid-19 spreading is occurring. "
105480,"In this paper, we have used timeseries data from the Johns Hopkins University Coronavirus Resource Center on the cumulative number of confirmed cases and deaths due to COVID-19 to build a data-driven model of infection dynamics under social distancing. We find that the COVID-19 pandemic in all regions with sufficient data can be described by a universal curve where the cumula-tive numbers of both infections and deaths quickly cross over from exponential growth at early times to a longer period of power law growth, before eventually slowing. In agreement with a recent statistical forecasting model by the IHME, we show that this dynamics is well described by the cumulative distribution function of the normal distribution. Surprisingly, we find that the despite the enormous variation in region/state/country characteristics and social policy, the infection dynamics across all regions/countries analyzed can be characterized by two FIG. 8: Scale-free and Erdös-Rényi random networks can reproduce observed dynamics. Simulations of virus spreading on scale-free and Erdös-Rényi random networks with 5,000 nodes were performed as described in the main text and methods. Scale-free networks were sampled with degree distribution p(k) ∝ 1/k γ , while Erdös-Rényi networks were sampled with mean degree k , shown in each panel title. The time required for a node to infect its neighbor is sampled from a Gamma distribution with mean µG = 50. Non-Markovian dynamics were generated by choosing standard deviation σG = µG/2 = 25, while Markovian dynamics were generated by choosing σG = µG = 50 (because the Gamma distribution reduces to the exponential distribution when µG = σG). Left column is log-linear plot while right is log-log. Black line is a straight line to guide the eye. Orange line is fit to the cumulative normal given in Eq. (1). The non-Markovian dynamics produce excellent fits (after the initial stochastic regime) for γ > 3 and for small k , while the fit quality degrades for Markovian dynamics or for smaller γ or large k . quantities: the predicted number of deaths/confirmed cases in a region N max and a scale σ that sets the natural timescale of infection in a region. Rescaling time and number of deaths/confirmed cases by these two quantities resulted in a remarkable data collapse of infection dynamics across regions, providing strong evidence for our claim of universal dynamics under current social distancing policies. Our analysis also suggests that, for countries and re-gions that have crossed the 50 death threshold, the predictive power of any statistical model based on tracking deaths or cases is likely to be extremely limited until a few days before the infection peaks. This suggests that it is very difficult to make predictions before curves start flattening. However, after the infection peaks, the uncertainty drops dramatically. This suggests that while it is very hard to make predictions early on, at later times it is possible to predict both the severity and duration of the infections with much more confidence. This uncertainty is present even though social policies may not be changing much. We have used our statistical model to make forecasts for regions, states, and countries where we have enough data. Importantly, our forecasts assume that there will be no dramatic shifts in social distancing policies. While we use the same fitting function as the IHME, our fitting procedures have crucial differences in the assumptions they make. Crucially, the IHME fitting procedure makes specific assumptions about the effects of social distancing and places strong priors on fitting parameters. In contrast, our model is agnostic to any social distancing procedures or population characteristics and fits each region and country independently. Nonetheless, we are able to obtain very good fits to the data. While many of the predictions between the two models show good agreement, there are some prominent disparities. For example using data up to April 15th for the US state of Massachussets, the IHME model predicts that there will be more than 8,200 deaths (with confidence intervals between 1,680 and 25,347) and the infection will peak on May 5th. In contrast, our model predicts 1,993 deaths (with confidence intervals between 1,302 and 5,366), with a peak time of April 14th. This likely reflects the fact that the IHME model imposes a large penalty on Massachusetts for its somewhat less stringent social distancing policies. A similar explanation likely holds for the case of Florida. It will be interesting to compare and contrast these two distinct approaches to fitting to better understand how to best forecast COVID-19 disease dynamics assuming that social policies continue as is. We also provided a preliminary exploration of how social distancing policies affect the parameters of the universal dynamics. To do so, we made use of the countryspecific social stringency index compiled by Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker [16] . While there were some anecdotal features in the per-capita fatalities of the most lax and most stringent countries, much more work needs to be done to adequately understand how different stringencies of social distancing affect disease spreading dynamics. One important caveat of our analysis of the effects of social distancing is that our statistical modeling approach is geared towards countries with relatively large death totals. Our model has little to say about countries like South Korea (about 230 deaths on April 15th) that have used extensive testing and social distancing to successfully contain the COVID-19 pandemic. Much more work will have to be done to understand this in greater detail. We emphasize that our statistical model is neither capable of, nor designed to, understand what will happen if policies change substantially. All of the countries we have analyzed have adopted significant social distancing protocols. Since we do not explicitly incorporate the effects of policy in our fits, we have no way of asking about what will happen if these policies change significantly. Nonetheless, there seem to be some general lessons to be learned. First, despite all the variation across regions and countries, cases and deaths seem to quickly cross over from exponential to power law growth. Similar behavior was observed in other epidemics including HIV/AIDS and the 2014 Ebola outbreak [24, 28] . This suggests that it is useful to plot all data in both log-linear and loglog scales. Second, it cautions against making extrapolations far into the future based on exponential growth, since power law growth seems to be quite consistent and generic. Finally, to better understand the origin of these dynamics, we performed simulations of disease spreading on social interaction networks. We focused on dynamics where the time it takes an individual to infect their neighbors follows a non-Markovian waiting time distribution. Furthermore, we assumed that individuals could have significant heterogeneity in their infection times. With these assumptions, we were able to reproduce the universal dynamics observed in real COVID-19 data using our simulations. While much more work needs to be done to understand the origin of this universal dynamics, these simulations suggest that the combination of non-Markovian dynamics and significant heterogeneity among individual transmission times may be crucial factors governing disease spreading dynamics.

105908,"In our first report of the analysis of mobility flows using mobile phone data up to March 28th, 2020, we find several interesting results. First, regarding the volume of in-, out-and self-flows between provinces, we find a significant decrease after the national lockdown (March 9th). Still, we do not find any significant decrease soon after the closure of the non-necessary productive activities. Regarding the in-and out-flow diversities, we find that while there is a slight increase in the flow diversity on the weekends before the lockdown, there is a strong decrease of the flow diversity on the weekends during the lockdown. Moreover, the application of data mining techniques reveals the presence of five main clusters of provinces. Finally, we use a community detection algorithm to find local job markets in Italy. We observe a striking increase in the number of communities during the lockdown and a slight increase after the closure of non-necessary activities. This suggests that reduced mobility split the territory into more and smaller local job markets. This information may be exploited by decision-and policy-makers to plan ""phase 2"" of the management of the epidemics. In the next report, we will investigate deeply how the structure of the OD matrices evolve in time, and we will extend the period of observation to the most recent days. We will also focus our analysis on some specific regions, considering the evolution of the epidemics at a municipality level. We will compare the impact of mobility reduction to the outbreak, answering several analytical questions: What is the virus-spreading effect generated by late-February north-south flows? How large should a ""red zone"" be to reduce effectively the spread of the epidemic? "
106168,"Beijing ""pandemic haze"" is a challenging case for source-receptor relationships (Fig. 5 ). Large emissions from industry in the BTH region (including boilers, cement, steel production and other industrial processes), as well as the further increased emissions in winter for heating (32, 33) , provide sufficient precursors to form the secondary aerosol in the case of enhanced oxidants, which transported into Beijing, resulting in an aggregated haze pollution. Even during the Lockdown period, most of the heavy industries in Hebei province were still in continuous operation with little emission reductions (34) . On the other hand, since Beijing is already in the ""low concentration pool"" of BTH region, a significant enhanced local atmospheric oxidizing capacity caused by the imbalanced vehicular emission reduction of NOx and VOC, only leads to a modest increase of secondary aerosols and PM2.5 concentration due to the inadequate precursors. All these make the relationship of vehicle emissions and air quality in Beijing different from that in other megacities (35) . The public were disappointed by the ""pandemic haze"" because of an expectation that previous efforts on controlling traffic to avoid the PM2.5 pollution would mean that during the lockdown there would be no pollution problems. Our modelling results indicate that the local traffic activity had little impacts on the winter haze events in Beijing. In addition, based on a series of sensitivity runs modifying the local on-road emissions in winter normal days (Pre period), even without vehicle emissions, the ambient PM2.5 concentration could only be reduced by 1.2 μg/m3 on average in urban and southern rural areas of Beijing (SI Appendix, Fig. S12 ). Although vehicles accounted for 65.6% of local NOx emissions, the concentrations of oxidants and fine particles would be consistently enhanced, with the reduction ratio of the vehicular NOx emissions rising from 0% to 100%, even when VOC emissions from vehicles were reduced by 100%. On the one hand, the abundant nitrate precursors in neighboring regions suppresses the effectiveness of local NOx emission control. On the other hand, reducing NOx emission favors the enhanced atmospheric oxidation ability to form more secondary particles, since many urban areas in China are prevailing under the VOC-limited condition (36) . Although reducing vehicular VOC and primary PM emissions were both positive in decreasing the PM2.5 levels, unfortunately, traffic control usually leads to greater NOx reduction than VOCs, which goes to explain why the annual reduction of vehicular emissions has resulted in reductions in VOCs that are only half (in percentage terms) the NOx reductions over the past years (37) . All these points above explain why traffic control cannot mitigate the winter haze pollution in Beijing currently, a point which also needs to be better explained to the public. In past years, the gradually strengthened vehicle emission controls have successfully contributed to the PM2.5 decrease in China (38) . In addition, past experiences from developed countries indicates that emission control on the continuously growing motor vehicle fleet is efficient and ultimately cost-effective to relieve the air pollution in a megacity (9, 10) . The problem for now is the imbalanced control among different source regions and air pollutants. Compared to its surrounding regions, local sources in Beijing reduced faster in the past years, which lead to the share of regional transport for the air pollution in Beijing increasing to 76.1% on average in the winter. As for the differences in local species controls in Beijing, the reduction rate of NOx and VOCs emissions used to be approximately 1:1, while the ratio is still large enough to increase the atmospheric oxidizing capacity under the strong VOC-limited condition in winter, which is proved by the enhanced oxidants during the COVID-19 lockdown (7, 39) . In addition, NH3 emissions, which are crucial for the formation of secondary inorganic aerosols, were still not effectively controlled, and the increased NH3 concentrations over past years weakened the benefits of the reduction in nitrate from NOx emission control in East China (40) . Therefore, the key is not judging whether traffic emission control is necessary, but accelerating VOC and NH3 emissions reductions and synchronously controlling regional sources to release the benefits on local traffic emission control. Targeting any of long-term air quality, climate change or street-level personal exposure, means any measures reducing vehicle emissions are going to be beneficial. To achieve PM2.5 concentration reductions in the short term, VOCs and primary PM2.5 should be jointly treated as the priority pollutants to control, or NOx emissions should be substantially reduced by the combination with other sources beyond vehicles so as to reach the non-linear tipping-point between changes of NOx reduction and oxidants concentration. For the first option, the new emission standard for LDV (China 6) , which will be implemented in July 2020, is expected to dramatically reduce the VOC emission from evaporations and will be effective to improve the air quality (41) . The challenge is to maintain popular support for mitigation policies such as reductions in traffic flow or restrictions in vehicle type which themselves lead to significant air quality improvements (PM2.5, NO2) but which are not directly visible to the general population in the face of the highly visible haze events "
106383,"The strict lockdown which we named phase B, showed a relatively slow, steady, and controlled spread of COVID-19 quite as expected. It was fulfilling its purpose effectively towards the control of pandemic in the country but on the other hand it was causing difficulties for daily wagers, and small businesses. The complete strict lockdown continued for more than a month. It affected the country's economy as all industries and import exports were ceased. For a developing country like Pakistan, it was difficult to keep strict lockdown for a long time. Hence, the government announced a smart lockdown to be enforced in stages. It means to re-open low-risk industries like manufacturing businesses, construction, industries related to food and agriculture, and factories with daily wagers and labor. All businesses that were re-opened were directed to follow SOP regarding workplace cleanliness, use of hand sanitizers and masks, and maintaining social distance. After this relaxation in the lockdown, the number of new daily cases increased abruptly. An increase in free-roaming and unnecessary movement of people was also noticed which should be handled strictly by special forces in every district. If this situation is not controlled then in a very short time it could be unmanageable and our health facilities could not capacitate them. There may be a need for a second lockdown for that which could have even worse effects on the economy. The lockdown from 23 March 2020 to 25 April 2020 proved quite effective in slowing down the growth of the outbreak in Pakistan. During this period, the number of daily reported cases drop by 6.55%. Due to the economic condition of the country, the government allowed some low-risk businesses to re-open, and hence mobility of people increased causing a 0.69% rise in daily reported cases. There is an immense need of following strictly to the guidelines provided by NIH for all re-opening businesses. The general public should also abide by the rules of home quarantine, hygiene, and all preventive measures. If the situation deteriorates then Pakistan might need to enter again into full second lockdown. "
106409,"In this study we perform a macroscopic analysis of the effectiveness of social distancing measures in the US during the COVID-19 pandemic using the notion of Granger causality. Our analysis indicate that the a reduction in out-of-home mobility Grangercauses the number of COVID-19 fatalities in a 2-week period. We further examine the presence of bidirectional Granger causality and we do not find any supporting evidence. We further provide a framework to identify the relationship between demographics and social distancing behavior. While this analysis does not provide causal relationships, it can certainly provide important information for policy makers while thinking of ways to increase compliance. Finally, we provide a visualization dashboard with the raw data as well as, the results from our analysis. This dashboard is constantly being updated with new results and data. We would like to emphasize here that the analysis and models presented in our work so far do not aim at predicting infections, deaths or other public health metrics. These predictions would require several additional steps that we have to take to reach this point. For instance, just an aggregate number of how many hours a person spends out of their home does not capture factors important for the prediction of infections. Was this movement to a high-risk location (e.g., a grocery store) or was it for a stroll around the neighborhood? Disentangling this is certainly not trivial and we are working in methods for identifying the number of potential contacts a person from a specific CBG is expected to have based on their mobility and the POI foot traffic data. Furthermore, it will be particularly useful to extend our analysis to a more (spatially) fine granularity, focusing on a microscopic analysis (e.g., at the county, or city, level). This will allow us to identify the exact time points of interventions and possibly attempt to extract causal relationships using quasi-experimental methods, such as instrumental variables and difference-in-differences. "
106576,"Following the highly restrictive measures adopted by many countries for combating the current pandemic, the number of individuals infected by SARS-CoV-2 and the associated number of deaths is steadily decreasing. This fact, together with the impossibility of maintaining the lockdown indefinitely, raises the crucial question of whether it is possible to design an exit strategy based on quantitative analysis. Guided by rigorous mathematical results, we show that this is indeed possible: we present a robust numerical algorithm which can compute the cumulative number of deaths that will occur as a result of increasing the number of contacts by a given multiple, using as input only the most reliable of all data available during the lockdown, namely the cumulative number of deaths."
107000,"Em um contexto em que não se dispõe de recursos farmacêuticos para conter o avanço do coronavírus em todo o mundo, o distanciamento social ocupa posição de centralidade nas ações de mitigação da COVID-19. Utilizando dados de geolocalização de celulares do Community Mobility Reports da Google, foi possível identificar as variações na circulação de pessoas em países selecionados da América do Sul para diferentes modalidades de distanciamento social adotadas durante a pandemia por COVID-19. Considerado um período de cerca de três meses (15 de fevereiro e 16 de maio) e utilizando análises descritivas para descrever as tendências de mobilidade de dez países da região por meio de um indicador sintético e, também, para identificar a existência de autocorrelação espacial nas tendências de circulação para três nações que adotaram medidas de distanciamento social distintas, sobretudo no início da pandemia, foi possível testar duas hipóteses: (a) em países com decreto de lockdown há maior sucesso na redução da mobilidade da população e (b) países selecionados (Argentina, Brasil e Colômbia) formam padrões regionais de mobilidade. Sobre a primeira hipótese, a tendência descrita pelo indicador de circulação dividiu os países analisados em s grupos, tendo sido menor a circulação de pessoas para a maior parte dos países que adotaram o lockdown (menor circulação). Nesse caso a exceção foi o Paraguai, que apesar de ter adotado essa medida extrema de distanciamento social em 20 de março, se situou na maior parte do tempo pós-pandemia no grupo dos países com maior nível de mobilidade. Nessa nação, até dia 06 de junho apresentava-se um dos menores níveis de infecção pelo novo coronavírus da América do Sul, com pouco mais de mil casos confirmados e apenas 11 óbitos [5]. As características peculiares de população e extensão territorial do Paraguai frente a de seus pares sul americanos, pode ter compensando a tendência oscilante na circulação de pessoas observada para esse país e impedido que a doença se espalhasse com maior velocidade. Portato, a excepcionalidade da tendência seguida pelo Paraguai permitiu confirmar apenas de maneira parcial a hipótese de que em países com decreto de lockdown há maior sucesso em reduzir a mobilidade da população. Os resultados obtidos por meio da análise descritiva de autocorrelação espacial (Índice de Moran Global e Local) mostraram que há dependência no espaço quanto à mobilidade da população no período considerado para os três países, confirmando, portanto, a nossa segunda hipótese. Sobretudo no caso do Brasil, país com o maior nível de mobilidade após a tomada das primeiras medidas de distanciamento social na região como um todo, a dependência espacial foi mais forte do que na Argentina e na Colômbia, países que estiveram na maior parte do tempo sob um regime estrito de lockdown. Este resultado é condizente com as medidas de distanciamento social adotadas por esses países, ou seja, em um cenário menos rígido de determinações nacionais restringindo a circulação de pessoas como no caso do Brasil, as unidades político-administrativas apresentam maior flexibilidade para lidar com seus decretos, o que se refletiu na formação de grandes aglomerações regionais nas tendências de circulação durante a pandemia. Em um cenário mais rígido, padrões regionais de mobilidade parecem importar menos ou sequer são formados. Por exemplo, no caso da Argentina e da Colômbia, a formação de outliers foi mais comum do que no caso brasileiro, assim como a formação de agrupamentos pequenos, ou seja, envolvendo poucos departamentos/províncias. Cumpre destacar que nesse artigo não foram considerados detalhes quanto às medidas adotadas pelos países para avaliar seus efeitos sobre a circulação de pessoas, apenas a natureza dos decretos do poder executivo de cada país, ou seja, se houve ou não o lockdown. Importante considerar também que características culturais, sociais, econômicas e políticas entre os países podem ter contribuído para os resultados encontrados e devem ser levados em consideração para se analisar a adesão às medidas de distanciamento social durante a pandemia. O Brasil que representa um caso à parte na América do Sul por suas dimensões continentais e grande diversidade sociocultural, também se destaca frente aos demais países quanto ao avanço da COVID-19. Conforme demonstrado no presente estudo, a alta circulação de pessoas e a formação de grandes agrupamentos do tipo low-low (baixa variação na mobilidade em relação à linha de base) indicam que decretos menos rígidos podem não ser por si mesmos eficientes para conter a circulação de pessoas. Em 06 de junho, o Brasil era o líder quanto ao total de novos casos na região, e o número de óbitos naquele país superava 30 mil [5] . Conforme já mencionado, somente no terceiro mês da pandemia alguns estados brasileiros adotaram períodos curtos de lockdown, sobretudo em cidades de maior porte, como Pernambuco e Fortaleza, ambos localizados na Região Nordeste do país e que enfrenta um rápido avanço da COVID-19. Importante destacar também que em ambos os países, os agrupamentos que indicam maior variação na mobilidade envolveram estados/províncias com nível elevado de infecção pelo novo coronavírus, como a província de Buenos Aires, a capital Bogotá, e os estados da Região Nordeste do Brasil. Pode ser que em locais duramente atingidos a população siga com maior rigor os decretos que inibem a mobilidade, e independentemente do tipo de decreto de distanciamento em vigor, se mais ou menos rígido.

107059,"In this paper we have made a case for treating pandemic response as a mechanism design problem. Through simple games modeling interacting selfish individuals we have shown that it is necessary to take incentives into account during a pandemic. We have also demonstrated that specific government policies significantly influence the outcome of these games, and how different response measures (sub-mechanisms) are interdependent. As an example we have discussed how contact tracing enables targeted testing which in turn reduces the uncertainty from individual decision making regarding social distancing and wearing masks. Governments have significantly more power than traditional mechanism designers in distributed systems; therefore it is crucial for them to carefully study the tradeoff between social optimality and the cost of the designer when implementing their pandemic response mechanism. Limitations and future work. Clearly, we have just scratched the surface of pandemic mechanism design. The models presented are simple and are mostly used for demonstrative purposes. Also, the mechanism design considerations are only quasi-quantitative without proper formal mathematical treatment. In turn, this gives us plenty of opportunity for future work. A potential avenue is extending our models to capture the temporal aspect, combine them with epidemic models as games played on social graphs, and parametrize them with real data from the ongoing pandemic (policy changes, mobility data, price fluctuations, etc.). Relaxing the rational decision-making aspect is another prominent direction: behavioral modeling with respect to obedience, other-regarding preferences and risk-taking could be incorporated into the games. Finally, a formal treatment of the mechanism design problem constitutes important future work, incorporating hierarchical designers (WHO, EU, nations, municipality, household), an elaborate cost model, and analyzing optimal policies for different time horizons. If done with care, these steps would help create an extensible mechanism design framework that can aid decision makers in pandemic response. "
107076,"COVID-19 has forced quarantine measures in several countries across the world. These measures have proven to be effective in significantly reducing the prevalence of the virus. To date, no effective treatment or vaccine is available. In the effort of preserving both public health as well as the economical and social textures, France and Italy governments have partially released lockdown measures. Here we extrapolate the long-term behavior of the epidemics in both countries using a Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered (SEIR) model where parameters are stochastically perturbed to handle the uncertainty in the estimates of COVID-19 prevalence. Our results suggest that uncertainties in both parameters and initial conditions rapidly propagate in the model and can result in different outcomes of the epidemics leading or not to a second wave of infections. Using actual knowledge, asymptotic estimates of COVID-19 prevalence can fluctuate of order of ten millions units in both countries."
107133,"Tropospheric nitrogen dioxide (NO$_2$) concentrations are strongly affected by anthropogenic activities. Using space-based measurements of tropospheric NO$_2$, here we investigate the responses of tropospheric NO$_2$ to the 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19) over China, South Korea, and Italy. We find noticeable reductions of tropospheric NO$_2$ columns due to the COVID-19 controls by more than 40% over E. China, South Korea, and N. Italy. The 40% reductions of tropospheric NO$_2$ are coincident with intensive lockdown events as well as up to 20% reductions in anthropogenic nitrogen oxides (NO$_x$) emissions. The perturbations in tropospheric NO$_2$ diminished accompanied with the mitigation of COVID-19 pandemic, and finally disappeared within around 50-70 days after the starts of control measures over all three nations, providing indications for the start, maximum, and mitigation of intensive controls. This work exhibits significant influences of lockdown measures on atmospheric environment, highlighting the importance of satellite observations to monitor anthropogenic activity changes."
107279,"While our analysis does not include many important factors, we can still make some general conclusions. Selfish strategies still ""flatten the curve."" By including adaptive behavior of individuals, our model predicts epidemic curves with flatter growth rate, compared to the classical counterparts. In our simple model, the curve is flattened naturally because of susceptibles who weigh the trade-off between current utility of making contacts and the future cost of getting infected. The recovered and the infected do not have any trade-offs to decrease contacts. Even if only the susceptibles are practicing social distancing, it still decreases the number of contacts of the system, and so the infected population reaches a smaller peak (Fig. 3,  4) . It should be emphasized that the curve is flattened because individuals anticipate future growth in infections and decrease their contacts to avoid being exposed to the infected individuals. If the possible outbreak is flat-out denied by the media, then individuals will not adapt their behaviors, causing an unmitigated large peak in the infected population. Therefore, it is the responsibility of the policymakers to clearly communicate the existence and extent of the spreading disease. Selfish strategy of the infected is never socially optimal. We prove that the socially optimal strategy of the infected, c opt I , is always less than c eq I . Therefore, policies in response to the epidemic should decrease the contact rates of the infected. We see examples of policies with this aim such as quarantining the infected or granting paid sick leave to individuals who tested positive. Both policies respectively decrease the contact rates of the infected directly or indirectly by decreasing b I , reducing the potential gain in utility of making more contacts. Because reducing the contacts of the infected is so important, policymakers might consider even more aggressive policies. It is important to control the infected contact rates, following the peak of the epidemic. If cost is imposed to the central planner in changing the contact rates of the individuals, we find the new socially optimal contact rates, depending on k, which is the per capita unit cost of changing contact rates. For k = 0 and k 1 respectively, we find the cost-imposed socially optimal solution to be the previously computed c opt and c eq . For k values in between (Fig. 7) , we commonly see that when it is too costly to decrease the infected contact rate for the whole time period, it is most beneficial to at least focus on decreasing after the epidemic has subsided. An assumption here is that cost of central planning is constant in time, when it may not be in real world situations. When outbreak is at its peak, more public attention is on the disease, and it may be easier to implement social distancing or secure funding for quarantining. However, when the disease has subsided, it might be harder to convince the public to behave differently. This result reinforces the need for formal social distancing policy which goes beyond the peak of the epidemic. When the disease is prevalent, social distancing can be naturally favored due to individual optimization, but to sustain it for longer requires centralized public policy to prevent second peaks. This general result is in agreement with other studies of COVID-19 policies which mention the likely possibility of second peaks [12] [13] [14] . Additional work, using more realistic central planning cost depending on time and population structure, will help us better understand how such long-term social distancing policies should be implemented. Policies are most needed for diseases with low µ, high a I , high β and intermediate b I . By computing the price of anarchy, we can measure the effect of different parameters on how much the system is degraded by the selfish behaviors. Diseases with low µ, high a I , high β, intermediate b I , in this order, seem to most affect the population such that their selfish behaviors will degrade the system more compared to central intervention. An interesting future work will be to put different diseases on the spectrum of these 4 variables, depending on its epidemiological characteristics as well as its economic and health effects on the infected. Then, we can roughly categorize diseases which need to be centrally intervened in the case of an outbreak. Figure 6 : With initial condition x I (0) = 0.3, we compute the socially optimal contact strategies and corresponding population dynamics for k = 0.4, 0.7, and 1. As k is increased, it becomes more expensive to shift the infected strategies from the selfish strategy, and so the socially optimal contacts of the infected is larger, as the cost of lowering it begins to outweigh the utility benefits.

107286,"In this paper, we studied DN-SEIR, a data-driven approach to evaluate the effective reproduction number of the COVID-19 epidemic. In particular, we considered both manual and search-based mitigation strategies, with the aim to help decision-makers in the evaluation and selection of exit strategies. To this end, we evaluated the state-of-the-art compartment model (i.e. SEIR) and shew that our approach yields predictions closer to the ground truth. We also demonstrated that learning can transfer across different countries and a simple FFNN provides accurate and interpretable predictions. Finally, we proposed a search-based approach to evaluate and find optimal strategies that satisfy the constraints of the health facilities and achieve a quick economic recovery with limited casualties. Our approach paves the ways to automated strategy simulation and search and provides a simple, yet, powerful tool for policy makers to tailor exit strategies to their context and priorities. We can go further than our approach with better feature engineering or neural architecture search (with CNN or RNN). We can also extend the data-driven prediction of hyper-parameters not only to the effective reproduction number but also to all the epidemiological parameters like hospitalization rate. This would require having access to accurate hospitalization data across a large pool of countries and can be achieved in the close future as more countries are sharing such data. Finally, we could extend our technique to a more-grained approach that takes into account age-specific or location-specific epidemiological models.  "
107581,"Non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) such as quarantine, self-isolation, social distancing, and virus-contact tracing can greatly reduce the spread of the virus during a pandemic. In the wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, many countries have implemented various NPIs for infection control and mitigation. However, the stringency of the NPIs and the resulting impact among different countries remain unclear due to the lack of quantitative factors. In this study we took a further step to incorporate the effect of the NPIs into the pandemic dynamics model using the concept of policy intensity factor (PIF). This idea enables us to characterize the transition rates as time varying quantities instead of constant values, and thus capturing the dynamical behavior of the basic reproduction number variation in the pandemic. By leveraging a great amount of data reported by the governments and the World Health Organization, we projected the dynamics of the pandemic for the major economies in the world, including the numbers of infected, susceptible, and recovered cases, as well as the pandemic durations. It is observed that the proposed variable-rate susceptible-exposed-infected-recovered (VR-SEIR) model fits and projects the pandemic dynamics very well. We further showed that the resulting PIFs correlate with the stringency of NPIs, which allows us to project the final affected numbers of people in those countries when their current NPIs have been imposed for 90, 180, 360 days. It provides a quantitative insight into the effectiveness of the implemented NPIs, and sheds a new light on minimizing both affected people from COVID-19 and the economic impact."
107605,"In this section, we discuss the impact of the policy decisions on the probabilities of COVID-19 spreading amongst the student population. In particular, we looked at two different modes by which COVID-19 could spread: 1) spreading amongst the people who are in the same place as where you stay. We call this vector as local spread. 2) spreading amongst people that you meet as you travel to and spend time at places other than your primary place of residence. We call this vector as mobility spread. Controlling each of these vectors requires different approaches. In particular, controlling local spread requires reducing the density of people that you stay with while controlling mobility spread requires reducing the amount of movement outside their homes that individuals perform. Note: both these approaches also apply in both cases just with different intensities. For example, limiting the movement you do at home can control local spread but this may not practical in many homes while reducing the density of people, in general, can reduce mobility spread as well. In this paper, we present results from two campuses in Singapore and one in the North-Eastern portion of the United States of America showing the effect of various COVID-19 related containment policies on the occupancy and mobility patterns on each campus. Our data was collected directly from the WiFi infrastructure at each campus. Our results showed that work-from-home and split-team work arrangements were quite effective at reducing the overall occupancy of buildings on campus. However, reducing the mobility rate of individuals on campus require nothing less than a full lockdown. Our analytics are already being used by campus administrators to understand the impact of the various policies being enacted. We are currently improving our analytics, user interfaces, and visualisations to allow administrators to easily understand the occupancy and mobility impact of various COVID-19 related policies such as mandatory social distancing, online learning, flipped classrooms, and split-team arrangements. This is particularly important as these measures will be used at scale when lockdowns are lifted, and classes resume for the Fall semester. "

(0) and R0 as fitted to 0 of all available from the data as available upto 16 th April 2020, as shown in Fig.2 , and as fitted ( 8.52 and 1/6, respectively). It is important to observe that active cases which differ from infected by the number recovered or died, is not significantly lowered. The fit of this curve is dictated by 1/6.36. The table I represents various input parameters used. In Fig.2 , the data as available [16] has been presented. This has been fitted to an exponential growth in Fig.3 . Fig 4 presents a fit of the active data. The death count fit is given in Fig 5. Finally, the model based predicted curves are presented in Fig. 6 . As can be easily observed from Fig. 6 , the observed data fits excellently to an exponential growth but with a small rate of increase. The fit has been incorporated into an expected evolution of infected number assuming a lockdown initiation. As R tends to zero, the number saturates. Again, when recovery is introduced in mean half life of 50 days, we get a peaked curve which may be a true picture, provided no new factors emerge. The initial recovery mean life considered was 14 days which turned out to be too quick and did not match with the recovery fit as one compares fit parameters of Ne and Na. It may be noted that if we assume that the number of infected Ne is underquoted as the tests are not conducted thoroughly, we can update these by finding an updated ̃ which has been grown from the death data, we get a significantly enhanced data, as plotted in Fig. 7.   Fig. 7 , ̃ -a normalized Ne as raised from the number of deaths due to COVID-19 Using this data will raise the data in Fig.7 by a factor of 3 , approximately. In conclusion, the aim of this paper is to give new ideas to model such cases of infected disease evolution. There may be possible objections to the choice of breadth of R after lockdown. There are also additional factors which develop as some hotspots emerging. A more realistic model needs to address these issues. However a new way to establish the data based theoretical model gives a new idea with great insight into how the factors are controlled and should be applied in most such studies instead of simulations where the contact with the processes is lost.

108203,"We analyze Italian mobility data before and after the lockdown introduced to face the COVID-19 pandemic. We highlight how variations in mobility relate to some fundamental economic variables and we show that reduction in connectivity tend to be stronger for municipalities with low average individual Income and high income Inequality. At the same time, we show that the reduction in connectivity tends to be higher for municipalities with higher Fiscal Capacity. Our findings start to shed light on some social and economic consequences of policy mea-sures adopted to contain the diffusion of COVID-19. First, the lockdown seems to unevenly affect the poorer fraction of the population. On another side, we find that the reduction in mo- We provide a snapshot of the mobility network on two Mondays before and after national lockdown (9th March), respectively on February 24th (A) and March 30th (B). Nodes represent municipalities aggregated at province level, and they all have equal size, whereas thickness of edges is proportional to the weight. Inserts provide an outlook on different regions, where node size is instead proportional to the population of the province. Temporal evolution of the global efficiency for the Italian mobility network from February 23rd to April 4th. Efficiency is computed according to (19) .

108223,"More sophisticated calculations can be compared with ESIR2 and D ′ 2 predictions. In particular, Monte Carlo (MC) simulations have also been performed in this work for the Spanish case [24] , which consist of a lattice of cells that can be in four different states: susceptible, infected, recovered or death. An infected cell can transmit the disease to any other susceptible cell within some random range R. The transmission mechanism follows principles of nuclear physics for the interaction of a particle with a target. Each infected particle interacts a number n of times over the interaction region, according to its energy. The number of interactions is proportional to the interaction cross section σ and to the target surface density ρ. The discrete energy follows a Planck distribution law depending on the 'temperature' of the system. For any interaction, an infection probability is applied. Finally, time-dependent recovery and death probabilities are also applied. The resulting virus spread for different sets of parameters can be adjusted from COVID-19 pandemic data. In addition, parameters can be made time dependent in order to investigate, for instance, the effect of an early lockdown or large mass gatherings at the rise of the pandemic. As shown in Fig. 12 , our MC simulations present similar results to the D ′ 2 model, which validates the use of the simple D-model as a first-order approximation. More details on the MC simulation will be presented in a separate manuscript [24] . Interestingly, MC simulations follow the data trend up to May 11 without any changes in the parameters for nearly two weeks. An app for Android devices, where the Monte Carlo Planck model has been implemented to visualize the simulation is available from Ref. [25] . In order to investigate the universality of the pandemic, it is interesting to compare all countries by plotting the D model in terms of the variable (t − t 0 )/b, where t 0 is the maximum of the daily curve given by t max = −b ℓn(c). By shifting Eq. 15 by t max = −b ℓn(c) and dividing by t max = a/c, the normalized D function is given by, The left of Fig. 13 shows similar trends for the normalized D curves of different countries, which suggests a universal behavior of the COVID-19 pandemic. Only Iran seems to slightly deviate from the global trend, which may indicate an early and more effective initial lockdown. A similar approach can be done for the daily data using peaks. "
108688,"This study proposed a cost and time effective approach to measure social distancing during the COVID-19 pandemic. Our findings show a strong correlation between the frequency of hashtags supporting and encouraging social distancing and the Google social distancing report. This research offers a new dimension for social distancing analysis during a pandemic and assessing social distancing policies. While this paper provided a new insight on measuring social distancing, it has some limitations. First, we didn't collect non-English tweets posted in US. Second, the evaluation process was limited to a national level analysis. Third, we selected one source for comparison. Future work could utilize non-English tweets, extend the evaluation process to state and county levels, and use other social distancing calculations.  "
108982,"The ongoing pandemic of Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) emerged in Wuhan, China in the end of 2019. It has already affected more than 300,000 people, with the number of deaths nearing 13000 across the world. As it has been posing a huge threat to global public health, it is of utmost importance to identify the rate at which the disease is spreading. In this study, we propose a time series model to analyze the trend pattern of the incidence of COVID-19 outbreak. We also incorporate information on total or partial lockdown, wherever available, into the model. The model is concise in structure, and using appropriate diagnostic measures, we showed that a time-dependent quadratic trend successfully captures the incidence pattern of the disease. We also estimate the basic reproduction number across different countries, and find that it is consistent except for the United States of America. The above statistical analysis is able to shed light on understanding the trends of the outbreak, and gives insight on what epidemiological stage a region is in. This has the potential to help in prompting policies to address COVID-19 pandemic in different countries."
109126,"If we compare the results in Section 3.2 with the consistent full lockdown from Section 3.1.1, we can see that it is possible to appropriately increase α without exceeding the ICU capacities, while the consistent full lockdown strategy would require a lockdown that takes approximately a year to be effective. Hence, while a consistent lockdown can effectively minimize the number of deaths, this strategy is only viable in case this lockdown can be prolonged over the corresponding time horizon, unless a vaccine is developed earlier. On the other hand, both the optimal controller and the baseline controller allow for a significant relaxation of the lockdown (on average a doubling of α), without significantly increasing the number of fatalities. In comparison to the baseline policy suggested in Section 3.1.2, the optimal control policy results in a slower but smooth loosening of the distancing policies. Without increasing the social cost over the full time horizon, this optimal policy avoids any violation of the maximum ICU capacity and hence results in a significantly smaller fatality rate. We point out that the resulting optimal policy of slowly increasing α is qualitatively similar to the resulting optimal policy in [14] , albeit for a different control goal. It can be seen that an initially ""stronger"" lockdown (i.e., a smaller value of α) over a longer time period with subsequent loosening leads to a better handling of the pandemic, compared to repeated tightening and loosening of distancing measures. Moreover, a smooth and monotone loosening of distancing policies is also desirable from an economic aspect since repeated lockdowns after interim-periods of relaxed distancing guidelines may be even more damaging to the economy, compared to an initially longer lockdown. Comparing our results with the proposed scenarios by the Helmholtz Association [39] , we find that we agree that the goal of herd immunity without overwhelming the health care capacity would require years. Our results further agree with [39] that the contact restrictions can only be loosened slowly if the health care capacity must not be overwhelmed. However, since the authors in [39] do not consider the availability of a vaccine, their conclusion is keeping or even increasing the lockdown until the number of infected persons is small and all infections can be traced efficiently and effectively via strategically allocated (and increased) testing. With the assumption of a vaccine within the next two years, we argue that a slow and smooth loosening of the lockdown does not lead to many more fatalities while decreasing the social and economic cost significantly according to our model. Concurrently, increased and strategically better allocated testing, e.g., via a contact tracing mobile app [44] , is of course highly beneficial and greatly advisable to improve the performance (even if it this was not accounted for in our model). To summarize, it seems possible to reduce the current restrictions and thus allow α to increase without exceeding the ICU capacity. Furthermore, optimized policies can significantly improve the outcome (in terms of fewer deaths and/or less social restrictions). However, the result is highly sensitive w.r.t. the change in the infection rate, while an accurate control of the infection rate α (e.g. ±5%) through governmental policies seems difficult/unrealistic. In the next section, we will therefore deal with these issues by formulating a robust control strategy that takes uncertainty in our COVID-19 model into account and uses feedback based on uncertain state information. In the following, we summarize our findings on a high-level and highlight the main take-away messages: • Our results in Section 3 confirm the conclusions in [15] that neither eradication of the virus nor herd immunity without the availability of a vaccine are viable solutions to handle the current COVID-19 outbreak. • Applying an optimizer to the mathematical model describing the outbreak, one can significantly reduce the number of fatalities without increasing the costs associated to decreasing the infection rate (social distancing policies, closing schools, etc.), compare Section 3.2. • Since the proposed model can never exactly predict the COVID-19 pandemic, applying a nominal optimal policy introduces unnecessary conservatism, at best, up to posing a great danger (i.e. overwhelming the health care capacities risking high mortality rates). Therefore, our findings in Section 4 support [15] by showing that any policy to control the COVID-19 outbreak successfully has to be an adaptive strategy. This means we need to constantly measure, monitor and estimate the current numbers and adapt our policy accordingly, i.e., feedback is necessary for reliably handling the outbreak. • If we already a priori take into account that our model includes mismatches and that all measured and estimated numbers are not exact and can have a bias, we can further improve the outcome, as shown in Section 5. More specifically, we developed a robust MPC-based feedback strategy using interval arithmetic. The application of feedback without the robust description of the considered model can lead to intermediate increases in the number of new infections necessitating another period of lockdown. On the contrary, a robust feedback strategy can take these model mismatches and other uncertainties into account and is hence able to avoid such behavior, thus significantly reducing the number of fatalities. • When looking at the qualitative results the robust MPC-based feedback offers, one can see that, accounting for the instability and uncertainty of the spread of the virus, the controller suggests a rather strict policy at the beginning and only then allows for a gradual increase in the infection rate. Keeping this loosening slow at the beginning shows a beneficial effect in the long run. This qualitative result of the robust MPC underpins also the German policy and reaction to the outbreak of COVID-19 in Germany where initially strong measures (what we here refer to as lockdown) were applied. Only very recently the German government started to loosen these measures slowly and gradually. There are also influences on the course of the outbreak that were not taken into account in the present paper but which are important in an overall strategy towards the spread of COVID-19 (e.g. increasing testing capacities, tracking of infections, as well as investigating which measures lead to the desired infection rate). However, controlling the infection rate is certainly one of the key factors and hence, this paper contributes towards mitigating the spread of COVID-19 under manageable societal and economic costs. We hope that the proposed feedback strategies inspire further investigations in this direction and offer qualitative and high-level insights that underpin the current policies or strategy papers. .1a) ). In addition, at the end of the horizon the number of contagious individuals should be nonincreasing, which is implemented as (A.1b). Hence, in the following, we replace the cost F by the number of fatalities E, and we add the following constraints to the optimal control problem (11) from Section 3.2: Again, the index k in (11) corresponds to weeks and the states IDART (k · T s ) correspond to the result of simulating the system (1) with the parameters and initial condition from Section 2. These terminal conditions (A.1a)-(A.1b) (which should be interpreted element-wise) ensure that the final state after the finite horizon N is ""better"" than the baseline solution (c.f. (A.1a) ) and the outbreak can be contained (c.f. (A.1b) ). The simulation results with the two baseline policies shown in Figure A.9 and A.10 demonstrate that the terminal constraints indeed effectively prevent the turnpike behavior. However, the additional constraints also lead to a slight increase in the number of fatalities.  "
109284,"Non-pharmaceutical measures to control the spread of infectious diseases and prevent a potential collapse of the health care system must be precisely coordinated in terms of timing and intensity. Based on well-calibrated mathematical models, the optimal intervention strategy for specific scenarios and objectives can be computed using continuous-time optimal control theory. In this paper, a generalized SEIR model was calibrated to reproduce the data of the initial exponential growth phase of the COVID-19 epidemic in Germany. Optimal control theory has been applied for the scenario in which an effective vaccine will never be found and the epidemic must be controlled with purely non-pharmaceutical measures. The computed optimal transmission rate describes a single-intervention scenario that satisfies two competing constraints: First, the minimization of the disease-related deaths by strictly avoiding an overflow of intensive care resources and, second, the suppression of a second epidemic wave by establishing sufficient natural immunity at the end of the measures. The optimally steered time-continuous non-pharmaceutical intervention ensures that the number of simultaneously infected persons does not exceed a certain threshold for a necessary period of time. Therefore, the optimal control obtained for this scenario is also of considerable interest for other cases, where e.g. a vaccine is expected soon but the number of infected cases must be held below a sufficiently low critical value over a longer period of time until the epidemic can be terminated by a mass vaccination. The optimal control computed in this paper is based on a relatively simple epidemiological model and the quantitative results for the COVID-19 epidemic depend to some extent on the chosen parameters. Therefore, the quantitative results should be treated with caution and must be compared with the results from more realistic models. Nevertheless, the described intervention scenario was shown to be qualitatively robust under parameter variation and has well understood and controllable stability properties. In particular, the control criteria (13)- (14) , which describe the optimal and stable path for easing the measures after an initial lockdown, are expected to be generally valid and could be directly applicable in practice. In summary, the control scenario described in this paper could serve as a guideline for the implementation and gradual relaxation of non-pharmaceutical intervention measures. Fig. 8 The stability of the disease-free stationary state depends on the size of the susceptible populationS and the basic reproduction number R 0 . ForS/N < R −1 0 , the outbreak of an epidemic is suppressed by a sufficiently high degree of herd immunity. "
109868,"In this paper, we conduct mathematical and numerical analyses to address the following crucial questions for COVID-19: (Q1) Is it possible to contain COVID-19? (Q2) When will be the peak and the end of the epidemic? (Q3) How do the asymptomatic infections affect the spread of disease? (Q4) What is the ratio of the population that needs to be infected to achieve herd immunity? (Q5) How effective are the social distancing approaches? (Q6) What is the ratio of the population infected in the long run? For (Q1) and (Q2), we propose a time-dependent susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) model that tracks 2 time series: (i) the transmission rate at time t and (ii) the recovering rate at time t. Such an approach is more adaptive than traditional static SIR models and more robust than direct estimation methods. Using the data provided by China, we show that the one-day prediction errors for the numbers of confirmed cases are almost in 3%, and the total number of confirmed cases is precisely predicted. Also, the turning point, defined as the day that the transmission rate is less than the recovering rate can be accurately predicted. After that day, the basic reproduction number $R_0$ is less than 1. For (Q3), we extend our SIR model by considering 2 types of infected persons: detectable and undetectable infected persons. Whether there is an outbreak in such a model is characterized by the spectral radius of a 2 by 2 matrix that is closely related to $R_0$. For (Q4), we show that herd immunity can be achieved after at least 1-1/$R_0$ fraction of individuals being infected. For (Q5) and (Q6), we analyze the independent cascade (IC) model for disease propagation in a configuration random graph. By relating the propagation probabilities in the IC model to the transmission rates and recovering rates in the SIR model, we show 2 approaches of social distancing that can lead to a reduction of $R_0$."
110115,"It is well-known that computer viruses may cause a slowdown of the Internet [21] , [22] . In 2020 we all learned that also biological viruses may affect the global Internet performance, because of the changes they bring in the way we live. In this paper, we analyzed the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the latency of the Internet at a large scale. Latency is particularly important not only because it has a profound effect on some classes of applications, but also because it is, by itself, an excellent indicator of the health status of the network. Results, which have been obtained from the analysis of a large amount of measurements (the European AMD-based results rely on more than 6 billion latency values), show that the impact of the increased on-line activities is relevant, especially in terms of higher jitter. The major changes have been observed in the evening, the time of the day when most of the on-line activities are related to entertainment. This suggests that distance learning and remote working contributed to a lesser extent in terms of additional network latency. Results obtained for the considered countries show relevant differences, which can be due to the resilience levels of their network and/or to the non-uniform restrictions imposed by authorities. Overall, the COVID-19 pandemic impacted negatively on the latency of the Internet, in particular in terms of increased variability, because of the higher demand of network resources associated to the mutated style of life. This phenomenon has been quantitatively evaluated for the first time in this paper on a country-level and continent-level scale, using one of the largest dataset of measurements currently available. We believe that the provided numbers and the related analysis, despite being limited to a portion of the Internet, definitely shed light on this previously unseen event in the history of the Internet.

110176,"The minimization of AICc and forecast error measurements suggests the following parameters (Table 2) : Italy (4, 2, 4), Russia (1, 2, 1), and USA (6, 2, 3). 12 In the case of Italy, ARIMA (4, 2, 4) is the absolute best according to all criteria. For Russia, MAE, MASE, and RMSE suggest ARIMA (1, 2, 2); however, the AICc and MAPE are definitely lower for the ARIMA (1, 2, 1) . For the USA, ARIMA (6, 2, 3) performs far better in all measures of forecast accuracy, but the AICc, which is slightly higher than the ARIMA (2, 2, 4). I chose the former, also based on the residuals auto-correlation structure. Moreover, MAPE and MASE may give other useful information on the fitting accuracy. In particular, MAPEwhich is the most widely used error measure (Goodwin and Lawton, 1999; Ren and Glasure, 2009; Moreno et al., 2013; Kim H. and Kim S., 2016 )indicates an overall forecast accuracy (100-MAPE) of 86.96% for Italy, 88.61% for Russia, and 90.41% for USA. 13 According to Lewis (1982, p. 40) , since the values of MAPE are close to 10, the forecasting is definitely good, especially in the case of the USA that shows a value lower than this ""limit"" (9.59). 14 MASE, which was more recently proposed by Hyndman and Koehler (2008) , seems to be more versatile and reliable. Since it is always lower than 1 for all three countries, it indicates that the computed forecast performs definitely better than in-sample one-step forecasts from the naïve method. The ACF and PACF correlogram plots of the residuals for Italy ( Figure C1 ) and the USA ( Figure C3 ) show a white noise process; in fact, any of the associated spikes go beyond the 95% confidence intervals. Meanwhile, the ACF and PACF correlogram plots for Russia exhibit a significant spike at lag 10, which reaches the 95% confidence limits ( Figure C2 ). Even if it should not be a particular matter of concern, I further examine the ARIMA model process by applying the Ljung-Box's test for autocorrelation and Engle's LM test for the Arch effect. The Ljung-Box's test shows that the null hypothesis of serial independence of the residuals can be accepted at each distinct lag for all three countries (Table B2 ). In the same way, Engle's LM test for the ARCH effect shows that the null hypothesis of no autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity can always be accepted (Table B3) . Therefore, the three ARIMA models show a very good fit. In Figures 4, 5, and 6 , I present the forecast results for 30 days in each country. From April 15 to May 14, Italy's coronavirus infectionthat is the ""benchmark"" of the analysis showed a clear sinusoidal and declining trend (Figure 4) . The new daily COVID-19 12 The estimated parameters are reported in Table B1 in Appendix B. 13 It is necessary to stress that the MAPE has also been affected by some criticalities. In fact, it put greater penalty on negative errors than on positive errors and may be very problematic with time points close to zero (Hyndman and Athanasopoulos, 2018, 3.4) . However, if the first is mostly out of control, the second aspect is not worry about because all time points considered in the analysis are far from zero. 14 Specifically, according to the interpretation of Lewis, the models for Italy and Russia are good forecasting, and that for the USA can be considered a highly accurate forecasting. cases should drop near zero in mid-June 2020, with an estimated epidemic final size of about 246,627 people. The outcomes for Russia ( Figure 5 ) and the USA ( Figure 6 ) are also characterized by a declining trend, indicating that they have probably already reached the peak of the COVID-19 outbreak. The major difference between the Italian and Russia/USA cases is that the slowdown in new COVID-19 cases seems to require more time for the latter. Specifically, Russia will reach zero local COVID-19 cases in late August 2020, while in the USA, the new COVID-19 cases will drop to zero between the end of September 2020 and the start of October 2020. This may confirm the importance of the rapid implementation of strict lockdown measures to contain the spread of the epidemic. In fact, Italy has been under one of the world's strictest lockdown for about 2 months, while Russia and USA have applied easier lockdown restrictions To control the reliability of my approach, in Tables 3 and 4 , I compared the predicted and latest actual daily cases in Italy and the USA, respectively. The results show that in Italy, the overall predicted new daily cases are overestimated, and this deviation grows over time. In the first 10 days of the forecast, the percentage deviation was about 7.27, and it increased until the 30 th day of forecast, when it stabilized around 22%. On May 26, i.e. after 42 days, the overall deviation between the predicted and actual values was equal to 15,326 cases, with a change of 22.52 percentage point. After 10 days, the MAPE was equal to 13.75% and it reached 33.32% at the end of the forecast (after 42 days). Therefore, for Italy, ARIMA performs better at predicting the final size rather than the daily cases. Regarding the USA, Table 4 shows that the overall predicted cases are a little bit underestimated. In particular, after 5 days, the percentage deviation was about -5.86% and it decreased distinctively after 19 days, reaching 4.11%. After 19 days, the overall deviation between predicted and actual values was equal to 17,128 cases. MAPE, which was equal to 5.73% after 5 days, slightly increased to 5.91% on June 4. Therefore, ARIMA models seem to perform better for the USA than Italy. About Russia, Table 4 shows that, after 5 days, the percentage deviation was about -2.82%, and it increased to -5.82% after 11 days. MAPE was equal 3.51% after 5 days, and 6.06% after 11 days. These values can be considered reasonable errors, all things considered. 15 In fact, if we look at Figures 7 and 8 , we see that in Italy and the USA, the predicted and actual daily cases follow a very similar and comparable trend. About Russia, the trends seem to differ a little after 5 days (Figure 9 ). This could indicate that the epidemic is still in the stabilisation phase. Even if the analytical approach seems to work well enough, these results are a rough guide only and should be additionally verified and updated.  To the best of my knowledge, this is the first study to implement an ARIMA model to predict the incidence of COVID-19 in the short/mid-term in Italy, Russia, and the USA. ARIMA models can be viewed as an easy and immediate tool to program health monitoring systems and to better allocate the available resources. In particular, it can help public health decision makers to plan the number of beds needed for moderate and critical care, and to better allocate and manage medical staff, healthcare devices, and healthcare facilities. Results suggest that Italy, the USA, and Russia reached the peak of COVID-19 infections in mid-April, mid-May, and late May, respectively. In particular, the USA and Russia will require a considerable length of time to drop near zero daily cases, if compared to Italy. This could be because Italy imposed stricter nationwide lockdown measures such as severe traffic and travel restrictions, bans on gatherings, and closure of commercial activitiesto mitigate the spread of the outbreak. Moreover, the comparison between the predicted and more recent actual values showed that forecasts are reliable enough, even in the mid-term, especially for Italy and the USA. Therefore, ARIMA may be considered a good model for short to medium-term forecasting, but the results should be interpreted with thriftiness. Finally, further useful and more precise forecasting may be provided by continuously updating these data, adding interventions and other real aspects, and applying the model to other countries and/or regions.

110183,"The ongoing novel coronavirus epidemic has been announced a pandemic by the World Health Organization on March 11, 2020, and the Govt. of India has declared a nationwide lockdown from March 25, 2020, to prevent community transmission of COVID-19. Due to absence of specific antivirals or vaccine, mathematical modeling play an important role to better understand the disease dynamics and designing strategies to control rapidly spreading infectious diseases. In our study, we developed a new compartmental model that explains the transmission dynamics of COVID-19. We calibrated our proposed model with daily COVID-19 data for the four Indian provinces, namely Jharkhand, Gujarat, Andhra Pradesh, and Chandigarh. We study the qualitative properties of the model including feasible equilibria and their stability with respect to the basic reproduction number $\mathcal{R}_0$. The disease-free equilibrium becomes stable and the endemic equilibrium becomes unstable when the recovery rate of infected individuals increased but if the disease transmission rate remains higher then the endemic equilibrium always remain stable. For the estimated model parameters, $\mathcal{R}_0>1$ for all the four provinces, which suggests the significant outbreak of COVID-19. Short-time prediction shows the increasing trend of daily and cumulative cases of COVID-19 for the four provinces of India."
110330,"In this study, we explored the possible effects of weather and government policy intervention on the daily confirmed cases of COVID-19. Specifically, the study considered the policy of partial lockdown of the two major cities (Accra and Kumasi) and their environs. The generalized linear model (GLM) framework for time series of counts by [17] was adopted for model fitting and analysis, which allows for regressing on past observations of the response variable and covariates. The results indicated that daily confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Ghana correlated negatively with maximum temperature and relative humidity. Previous studies on SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV also highlighted temperature as an important factor in the survival and transmission of such coronaviruses [22] - [26] . Recent studies have also underscored the importance of weather on the transmission of COVID-19 in particular. For instance, using a Modified Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered (M-SEIR) model, [27] confirmed that transmission rate decreased with the increase of temperature, leading to further decrease of infection rate and outbreak scale in 31 provincial-level regions in mainland China. [28] also in a study suggested that for northern hemisphere countries, the rate of transmission of COVID-19 cases would significantly decrease as a result of warmer weather. [29] in a study stated that local weather condition with low temperature, mild diurnal temperature range and low humidity likely favor the transmission of COVID-19 cases in China. [30] in a study, analyzed the association between COVID-19 and climate indicators in New York City, USA. The authors used a secondary published data from New York city health services and National weather service, USA. The climate indicators included in the study were average temperature, minimum temperature, maximum temperature, rainfall, average humidity, wind speed, and air quality. Using Kendall and Spearman rank correlation tests for the data analysis, [30] suggested that that average temperature, minimum temperature, and air quality were significantly associated with COVID-19. Finally, using a global data on COVID-19 reported cases until 29th February 2020 and climate temperature data, [31] suggested that higher average temperature was strongly associated with lower COVID-19 incidence for temperatures of 1°C and higher. Our results further indicated the significance of maximum temperature, relative humidity and precipitation in predicting daily confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Ghana. This is consistent with the results of [32] , who implemented a restricted cubic spline function and generalized linear mixture model to analyze the relationships between temperature and COVID-19 transmission in 429 cities in the world and suggested that to a certain extent, temperature could significantly change COVID-19 transmission, and there might be a best temperature for the viral transmission, which may partly explain why it first broke out in Wuhan, China. [33] also investigated the influence of air temperature and relative humidity on the transmission of COVID-19 in 100 Chinese cities and suggested that, under a linear regression framework, high temperature and high humidity significantly reduce the transmission of COVID-19. Additionally, results of the intervention analysis conducted in this study indicated that the null hypothesis of no significant effect of the specific policy intervention of partial lockdown should be rejected (p-value=0.0164) at a 5% level of significance. This finding underscores the significance of the partial lockdown of the two largest cities (Accra and Kumasi) and their environs in controlling the spread of the disease in Ghana. A number of studies [14] - [16] have been conducted on the effects of lockdown on the number of new confirmed cases and/or on deaths. All of which reveal that lockdown serves an important intervention for preventing and minimizing the impact of an outbreak. In this paper, we investigated the effects of weather and government policy intervention on the daily confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Ghana. The results indicated that while daily confirmed cases of COVID-19 correlated negatively with maximum temperature and humidity, it rather correlated positively with precipitation and maximum wind. Also, maximum temperature, humidity and precipitation were significant predictors of daily confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Ghana. Furthermore, results of the intervention analysis revealed that the specific government policy of partial lockdown of the two largest cities (Accra and Kumasi) and their surroundings significantly influenced the daily confirmed cases of COVID-19, which provides useful implications for policy makers and the public. For instance, knowing that precipitation and the daily confirmed cases of COVID-19 are positively correlated could help public health responses by informing key preparations as we move into the rainy season. "
110539,"The simulation results clearly show that the effect of a lockdown of Tokyo quickly propagates to other regions outside Tokyo, leading to a substantial effect on the entire Japanese economy. Although the production of non-essential sectors in Tokyo accounts for 21.3% of the total production in Japan, a lockdown of Tokyo for a month would result in a reduction of the daily production in Japan by 86.1% or 1.25 trillion yen. In addition, the effect on other regions becomes progressively larger, as the duration of the lockdown becomes longer: When the duration becomes twice, the production loss becomes more than twice. In the case of a lockdown for one day, the total loss of value added outside Tokyo is 82% of the loss in Tokyo. However, when the lockdown continues for a month, the loss outside Tokyo is twice as large as the loss in Tokyo. This implies that the effect of a longer lockdown can reach firms that are ""further"" from Tokyo along supply chains. To alleviate the propagation effect through supply chains, one could limit production activities shut down or prioritise producers' use of goods and servies over consumers' use. However, our results indicate that these measures would not work well, particularly when the duration of the lockdown is long. Our analysis provides several policy implications. First, because the overall effect of a lockdown of a major city on the entire economy is extremely large when we take into account its propagation effect through supply chains, we should consider lockdowns as the last resort. Rather, we should prevent the spread of COVID-19 earlier using other means and avoid any lockdown of a mega city. Second, because the total effect of a lockdown progressively increases with its duration, a mega-city lockdown, even if it cannot be avoided, should be as short as possible. Policymakers should be aware that policies to alleviate the propagation effect may not work when the lockdown duration is long. Several caveats of this study should be mentioned. First, we assume that firms cannot find any new supplier when supplies from their suppliers in Tokyo are disrupted, although they can request their existing suppliers outside Tokyo to supply more. This assumption may be too strong in practice, leading to an overestimation of the propagation effect. However, because we particularly examine a short-term lockdown for at most two months, the possible overestimation can be minimal as finding new suppliers in the short period of time is not easy. Second, the TSR data reports only the location of the headquarter of each firm, not the location of its branches. Because headquarters of firms concentrate in Tokyo, production activities in Tokyo are most likely to be overvalued in our analysis. Therefore, the direct effect of a lockdown of Tokyo may be overestimated while its propagation effect on other regions may be underestimated. Because we still found a large propagation effect despite of this possible underestimation, our key conclusion should remain the same. Third, because of the data limitation, we cannot estimate the propagation effect of a lockdown of Tokyo on foreign economies outside Japan. Kashiwagi et al. [6] find no international propagation effect in the case of Hurricane Sandy in the United States, suggesting that substitution for damaged suppliers can alleviate propagation. However, in the case of the spread of COVID-19, because all industrial countries are affected, input substitution across countries is quite difficult. Therefore, we would expect international propagation of the economic effect of a lockdown of a city amid the spread of COVID-19, but quantifying this propagation is beyond the scope of this study. Finally, we should emphasise that this study focuses on the economic effect of a lockdown of a major industrial city, rather than the overall economic effect of COVID-19. In practice, COVID-19 should affect economies outside a mega city not only through propagation of the effect of its lockdown but also directly through other restrictions in the region and indirectly through propagation of the effect of lockdowns of foreign cities. Because these effects are not included in the simulation of this study, the total economic effect of COVID-19 can be considerably larger than estimated here. We estimate the value of each transaction between two firms in two steps. First, we divide each supplier's sales into its customers in proportion to the sales of customers, defining a tentative sales value. Second, we employ the IO table for Japan in 2015 [17] to transform these tentative values into more realistic ones. Specifically, we aggregate the tentative values at the firm-pair level to obtain the total sales for each pair of sectors. We then divide the total sales for each sector pair by the transaction values for the corresponding pair in the IO tables. The ratio is then used to estimate the transaction values between firms. The final consumption of each sector is allocated to all firms in the sector, using their sales as weights. "
110610,"In this paper we presented a model and an algorithm that aims to help authorities to take more efficient decisions in the fight with COVID-19. Naturally, the most stringent open problem is to test and validate the model and the algorithm on real data. People have a huge mobility nowadays and it is impossible to create a model which is fully accurate. Nevertheless, based on our tests we believe that our model is capable of capturing the most important features of the current situation. Also, a natural open problem is to tune the input parameters: the probabilities p in the input graph, the cost of closing facilities and isolating people c and c and the contagion risk associated with each person. Since the economy is under severe pressure under the current lockdown, we expect that some ease of the restrictions will happen soon. Thus, we are hopeful that our model will give the authorities some insight in taking the best decisions. Moreover, as we can see from our experiments, even with a very small budget (sometimes as low as 1% of the total cost necessary to lock down the entire economy), the risk of infection can be decreased significantly. Thus, we strongly believe that, with wise decisions, it is possible to stop the spread of COVID-19 without an economic collapse. "
110853,"Fast intermittent lock-down intervals with regular period are suggested as a COVID-19 exit strategy from the widely adopted policy of total lock-down. Many proposed exit strategies have risks and uncertainties which could lead to a second wave of infection [1,2]. We demonstrate that our proposed policies have the potential to be a method of virus suppression, while at the same time allowing continued (albeit reduced) economic activity. Furthermore, these policies, while not eliminating the virus, can nevertheless be sustained over long periods of time, until a vaccine or treatment becomes available. The robustness of these policies stems from the fact that they are open loop methods; namely, lock-down periods are not triggered by measurements -- inevitably uncertain and delayed -- over short time scales such as hospital admissions, but rather are driven by predictable, high-frequency, periodic triggers in- and out- of lock-down. A slow and inherently robust outer supervisory feedback loop, based on measurements over longer time scales, is used to tune the parameters of the mitigation strategy. These methods can act alone, or can be used in combination with other mitigation strategies, to provide additional levels of effectiveness in their operation."
111000,"The results indicate that that Single Exponential Smoothing (SES) is the most accurate model for forecasting confirmed, recovered and death cases COVID-19. The trend analysis with 95% confidence interval shows the followings: -The number of forecasting confirmed cases will be expected to be increased up to more than 200000 cases around the world in 9 th of April 2020 as shown in Fig.11 -The number of forecasting recovered cases will be expected to be increased up to more than 140000 cases around the world on the 9 th of April 2020. Accordingly, the recovered ratio will be 96.5% as shown in Fig.12 . -The number of forecasting death cases will be expected to be increased up to more than 7000 cases around the world on the 9 th of April 2020. Accordingly, the death ratio will be 3.5% as shown in Fig.13 . Where N d : the number of confirmed cases on a given day. N d+1 : the expected number of confirmed cases in the next day. E: average number of people someone infected is exposed to each day. P: the probability of each exposure becoming an infection. N d : the number of the coming days (day). d: the given day. The growth factor can be calculated as follows: GF = (9) Where GF: The growth factor of the confirmed cases of the virus. N d : the number of new confirmed cases on a given day. N d-1 : the number of new confirmed cases in the previous day. Fig.14 displays the growth factor of the confirmed cases outside mainland China. The growth factor was at peak 1.8 on 25 January 2020 and was fluctuating from 23 January 2020 to 14 February 2020.

The inverse of an exponential function is a logarithmic function. The data were compared on a logarithmic scale to identify exponential growth in the recorded cases. The recorded COVID-19 cases outside mainland China have been plotted as in both exponential scale and in logarithmic scale as illustrated in Fig.15 . Based on the exponential chart, the expected growth can be represented by the following exponential function. Coronaviruses such as COVID-19 is declared as an international epidemic. Based on this study analysis and modeling, this research recommends that all world countries must mandate substantially more invasive quarantines, restrictions on travel and public gatherings, and closing of schools, universities, and workplaces (""Social Distancing"") in the near term when ICU beds are unavailable and patient deaths begin to rise precipitously. This will affect a significantly larger percentage of the world population than is currently affected by voluntary social distancing, including younger people in the workforce who might be asymptomatic but who are forced to work from home and curtail spending and travel. The number of people affected in the world will increase dramatically within the next three weeks. "
111190,"We consider an epidemic spreading in a city which is divided geographically into different districts. We introduce the reproduction matrix $\R=\bigl(R(i,j)\bigr)$ between districts, where $R(i,j)$ is the mean number of individuals in district $j$ infected by an individual from district $i$. We analyse policies of partial lockdowns of the city, that is of a set of districts, based on the study of matrix $\R$, where rows and columns corresponding to districts in lockdown are set to zero. This schema can also be applied to a country divided into regions or other appropriate units, provided the relevant information is available. We conclude by analyzing a matrix~$\R$ which was constructed for the spread of COVID-19 in Santiago, Chile, with the aid of an agent-based simulator for generating surrogate district data."
112205,"For preventing the spread of epidemics such as the coronavirus disease COVID-19, social distancing and the isolation of infected persons are crucial. However, existing reaction-diffusion equations for epidemic spreading are incapable of describing these effects. We present an extended model for disease spread based on combining an SIR model with a dynamical density functional theory where social distancing and isolation of infected persons are explicitly taken into account. The model shows interesting nonequilibrium phase separation associated with a reduction of the number of infections, and allows for new insights into the control of pandemics."
112551,"In this paper we have analysed, in the context of the standard SIR model for epidemic dynamics, the impact of different containment measures on size (the epidemic peak I P , the average number of infectedÎ P and the total number of infected I E ), the timescale (the occurrence time of the peak t P and the whole time-span t E ) and the speed (time variation of the reproduction number |V P |) of epidemics. Using an exact solution for the epidemic dynamics we have been able to derive the scaling behaviour of these quantities under change of the two parameters (the infection rate α and the removal rate β) of the SIR model, which can be controlled by the containment measures. This allowed us to compare the impact on size, timescale and speed of the epidemic of containment measures acting either on α or on β We have shown that for a given reduction of I P ,Î P , I E , the timescale and the speed of the epidemic are to a great extend sensitive to the kind of measures we put into play. By increasing the removal rate β instead of reducing the infection rate by a factor λ one can reduce the timescale of the epidemic by a factor 1/λ and increase the speed of the epidemics by a factor λ. In the case we have analysed in detail, namely the COVID-19 epidemic in Northern Italy, the reduction factor λ, in principle could also take values around 3. An important point we have not addressed in this paper is the determination of the exact way in which the usual containment measures used to fight epidemic, impact on the values of the parameters α and β. Whereas it is quite clear that social distancing reduces the parameter α and does not change β, the effect of other measures like, early detection and contacts tracing is not a priori evident. Early detection and contact tracing increase β only if implemented on a large scale and followed by prompt and strict isolation of the detected infectives. If this is not the case, it is likely that these measures just bring a small reduction of α The recent analysis of Gaeta [10] of the different strategies used in Northern Italy to tackle the COVID-19 epidemic seems to confirm this result. He found that simple early detection and contact tracing, while having an impact on the epidemic peak, do not substantially affect the timescale of the epidemic. On the other hand he also showed that contact tracing if followed by prompt isolation is the only efficient way to reduce the size of the epidemic, without having to live with it a long time. The Veneto experience shows that this was one of the factors underlying the success of the containment strategy in that region. Thus the main lesson one can draw from our results is that, epidemic containment measures focused on tracing, early detection followed by prompt removal of infected individuals are more efficient to fight epidemics than those based on social distancing. Let us conclude this paper with some comments about the range of validity of our results. The SIR model is an oversimplified model for epidemic dynamics. Generalisations of it are necessary in order to give a good descriptions of real epidemics. For instance, in the case of the COVID-19 epidemic a generalization of the SIR model seems to be necessary in order to take into account the presence of a large set of a asymptomatic infective [9, 10, 11] . On the other hand, the SIR model gives the bare bones of deterministic epidemic dynamics. For this reason we believe that, at least at qualitative level, the main result of this paper -the possibility to reduce the epidemic peak keeping under control its timescale by acting on removal rates-could remain true for generalized and improved SIR-like models. "
113084,"As the number of cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) caused by the virus SARS‐CoV‐2 rises exponentially in Australia with consequences for the health system and society at large, we need to remember that during this pandemic that necessary social distancing measures, effective school closures and rising unemployment levels may lead to an increased risk for child abuse and neglect."
113512,"3.1. Variation in meteorology during the analysis period Fig. 1 shows the wind rose plot for March 15th to April 14th of 2017, 2018, 2019 and 2020 for five different regions in India. Except central India, the wind pattern in most of the years during the analysis period was similar. In north India, south and southwest are the predominant wind direction with average wind speed of~1.5 ms −1 . In southern, eastern and western India, while predominant wind direction was south and southeast, the average wind speeds were~1 ms −1 ,~0.7 ms −1 and 0.8 ms −1 , respectively. However, in central India, even though wind speeds in all the years were similar (~2.1 ms −1 ), wind direction in 2020 (southeast), 2019 (west) and 2018 (southwest) were different. Furthermore, there were negligible variations in temperature in different regions during this period. For example, the average temperature in north India was 29.2°C (coefficient of variation~3%). Overall, it can be concluded that the meteorology in the analysis period during 2017 to 2020 was similar. Fig. 2 shows the temporal change in the average concentrations of the six criteria pollutants in the five regions. Overall, around 43, 31, 10, and 18% decreases in PM 2.5 , PM 10 , CO, and NO 2 were observed during lockdown period compared to the previous years. While there were 17% increase in O 3 and negligible change in SO 2 . The higher decrease in PM 10 compared to PM 2.5 could be due to its greater contribution from anthropogenic sources (Klimont et al., 2017) . The effect of restricted human activities due to the COVID-19 pandemic in India since mid-March of 2020 was studied by analysing concentrations of six criteria pollutants during March 16th to April 14th from 2017 to 2020 in 22 cities covering different regions. Among all pollutants, PM 2.5 had maximum reduction in most regions. In contrary, in most regions an increase in O 3 was observed, which could be due to the decrease in PM in addition to decrease in NOx. This substantial reduction in concentrations resulted in a 4 times reduction in ER. As expected, a significant reduction in AQI was observed in 2020 compared to previous years. However, four cities had O 3 as their dominant pollutant instead of PM 2.5 , suggesting that attention should also be given to decreasing emissions of precursors to secondary pollutants in addition to controlling primary PM. Correlation between cities especially in northern and eastern regions improved in 2020 compared to previous years, indicating more significant regional transport than previous years. Further analysis on actual and unfavourable meteorology using WRF-AERMOD modelling system concluded that even the predicted PM 2.5 could increase due to unfavourable meteorology, the average concentration would still be under CPCB limits. This study gives confidence to the regulatory bodies that a significant improvement in air quality in India could be expected if strict execution of air quality control plans is implemented. Note: MFB not following the US EPA criteria limit was underlined and the values where the concentrations in worst meteorology is lower than base case is shown using italics. "
114082,"Social distancing policies have profound social, economic and psychological consequences. The purpose of these policies is to reduce the physical interaction of people and thereby limit the propagation of disease. We hypothesized that the issuance of SAH on March 21, 2020 in Chicago, Illinois would have a significant impact on hand and facial trauma seen within the communities served by the University of Chicago Medical Center. Several interesting trends were noted in our data. Notably, the average number of daily consultations received decreased from 4.2 to 2.9 following the SAH. This suggests that social distancing policies may have been effective in reducing the potential for certain types trauma. Notably at our institution there wasn't a decline in overall trauma activations, there was actually a slight increase in the Copyright © 2020 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

We analyzed a convenience sample of public K-12 schools in the early weeks of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States. This initial snapshot provides some insights to inform future research into the variation of strategies across school districts, and would benefit from more rigorous methods to determine true correlations between demographic and geographic factors. Additionally, many of these strategies have evolved in response to ongoing and prolonged public health social distancing measures implemented after this analysis was conducted."

Therefore the results of the present article may help to combat the COVID-19 pandemic. It may also assist to think whether lockdown would be a measure to reduce social distancing among human beings and may reduce the spread of Coronavirus from region to other region extensively.

115930,"The COVID-19 pandemic progresses across the globe at pace, bringing lockdown of countries and continents. Over the Easter weekend as well as speculation that lockdown in the UK would need to be extended for a significant period, media attention became focussed on why the UK death rates from COVID-19 are significantly greater than in Germany (1). In a BBC television interview on Easter Sunday (2), Sir Jeremy Farrar who is a senior advisor to both UK and German governments commented that it is likely to be the significantly larger number of tests for SARS-Cov- 2 (the viral cause for COVID-19) undertaken in Germany when compared to the UK. He suggested that through early identification and isolation of cases that Germany, unlike the UK, had been able to contain COVID-19 and hence reduce transmission rates and need for hospitalisation."
116352,"In our present work, we analyze the observed data of COVID-19 cases in India using the SEIR model. To start with, we used data of COVID-19 from South Korea showing all the phases of active infected cases over time to validate our model. We used the chi-square minimization process to obtain best fitted parameters for South Korea and then later for India. Based on this approach, we forecast the peak of active infected cases for India. It is found that with respect to the ongoing lockdown situation in India, the peak of active infected cases will occur in mid of May 2020 with a maximum number ~43,0 0 0. Our study shows that the infected cases will tend to cease by the mid of August 2020 if lockdown is continued. Interestingly, our predicted peak time is very much consistent with the predictions made by Protiviti, a global consulting firm. In our model, we consider different values of β (other than for the lockdown condition; β = 0.19 day −1 ) to provide insight on the relative strengths of control measures taken by the government. Lower the value of β, indicates a relatively better strategy to control the spread. The removal of lockdown on May 3, 2020 may lead to ~21% increase (corresponding value of transmission rate, β = 0.38 day −1 ) in the peak value of active infected cases as compared to the peak value predicted for ongoing lockdown. This increase is due to the exposed individuals or asymptomatic individuals who are not diagnosed may actively transmit the disease in post-lockdown period. Therefore, in the post-lockdown period, it is highly important to trace such individuals who were not tested during lockdown due to resource limitations on the number of tests performed. Increasing the number of tests for early identification of COVID-19 cases during the lockdown period will certainly help in understanding the real picture of infected volume before coming up with strategies. GPS based mobile applications or web GIS applications which are capable of tracking movements and health status of individuals can provide useful information [28] . If an individual is found to be infected with COVID-19, such applications will help in tracing down the individuals who might have come in contact with the infected individual and their early isolation will help in controlling the spread. India's bold and timely decision going for a nationwide lockdown of 40 days has certainly helped the country in controlling the infection volume at the cost of negative socioeconomic impact. Whether to keep full or partial lockdown after May 3 is a decision dependent upon severely affected zones (states/districts/villages/cities) in the country. Lockdown removal strategies have to be smartly designed which do not allow estimated infected volumes to grow in these severely affected zones. In the post-lockdown period, practicing strong social distancing and sanitation in public places and at workplaces is needed. Model based forecasts of peak values will certainly help decision makers, especially public health and administrative departments of the state and central governments to assess their preparedness, control the pandemic and repair the socioeconomic damage caused by the pandemic. Lockdown period is a period not only to control the pandemic but a time bought to re-design the future national and international policies to ensure the sustainable growth of the economies. "
116409,"As as discussed in the text, the Rio de Janeiro state governement implemented isolation policies in March 17, 2020, in order to avoid the explosion of cases of COVID-19. After the initial exponential growth of cases (from March 5 to March 24), the cases continue to growth, but it exhibits a distinct, subexponential behavior. The SIQR model with containment is capable of reproduce the mentioned sub-exponential behavior. Considering the data, we have observed that the initial exponential behavior changed to the sub-exponential one about 7 days after the implementation of social distancing policies. We found that the isolation policies really work, i.e., the fact of isolate people in home, to avoid social contacts, decreased the growth rate of the number of cases. For the considered parameters, we observed that the number of quarantined individuals grows, stabilizes and after it decays to zero, as it is standard in compartmental models. Based on the data, we can see that the number of such isolated individuals grows until Day 99 from the beginning (March 5, 2020) of the disesase spreading. Thus, the model predicts that the maximum number of quarantined individuals will occur about June 11, 2020. This is in line with a recent estimate [9] . That peak is associated with the quarantine of about 0.041% of the Rio de Janeiro state population (about 6, 700 individuals). This number is about 600 times lower than the one predicted by the SIQR model without isolation policies (taking k 0 = 0), suggesting the effectiveness of the social isolation. In fact, combining quarantine of individuals tested positive (confirmed cases) with social distance, i.e., multiple interventions, appears to be effective to contain the rapid evolution of confirmed cases seen in the early evolution of the COVID-19 in Rio de Janeiro state. This is in line with a recent work [9] , where the authors analyzed the potential role of nonpharmaceutical interventions in UK and USA. They conclude that the effectiveness of any one intervention in isolation is likely to be limited, requiring multiple interventions to be combined to have a substantial impact on transmission. Concluding, we proposed in this work to study the dynamics of COVID-19 in Rio de Janeiro state, Brazil, by means of a SIQR model with containment policies. We confronted the model results with data from the Rio de Janeiro state Department of Health [23] , and the agreement between data and our numerical results is very good. The data shows that the social distancing policies led about 7 days to change the initial exponential growth of cases and to effectively decrease the rate of growth of confirmed cases in Rio de Janeiro. The relaxation of isolation policies was also discussed, in order to avoid a second wave of cases. The impact of isolation policies in the economy is important to be adressed. There is a fraction of the population related to the informal economy sector. These individuals are less propensed to self isolate, which impacts in the spreading of COVID-19. It can be interesting to split the population in two groups: one related to the informal economy, and another group that has the option of self-isolation. This analysis will enrich the model, and it can help the polciy makers to improve both the social isolation policies and the support to the fraction of the population that cannot afford for the self-isolation. The explicity analysis of deaths also need to be studied. Those proposals certainly will be considerd in future works. "
117269,"Lockdown, including restricted social contact and keeping open only those businesses essential to the country's supply chains, has had a beneficial effect in both countries. The trend slopes were considerably reduced for all the outcomes. However, this was not enough to change the rising trend of the epidemic. For this reason, more restrictive actions were suggested. The second lockdown, still ongoing, shows how the trends have changed, with a reduction of daily incident cases, deaths, and more significantly in ICUs. These are of similar magnitude in both countries, although Italy carries a week ahead of Spain. However, mortality still shows a small increase, probably because it follows incidence trends with a delay of 1-2 weeks. We should acknowledge that this figures could change during forthcoming weeks. Analysis of trends using daily incident data may be a useful complement to more conventional approaches used to monitor the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic by testing and reporting changes overtime after a public health intervention (i.e., lockdown, confinement or quarantine). Interrupted time-series regression models are relatively easy to implement using readily available data by health authorities (Bernal et al., 2017) . This is a descriptive analysis without predictive purposes. For an easy interpretation, and comparison of the effectiveness of lockdown measures between countries, a linear trend is assumed before and during the lockdown periods. The changes in the definition of diagnosed cases have not been taken into account, nor has the reduction in the susceptible population because of the lockdown. Therefore, the incident cases are modeled directly instead of the incidence rate, assuming that the entire population is at risk. Timely indications for public health authorities and governments are essential to slow down the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic and relieve the pressure on overburdened health services. Although available data is still limited, and findings must be interpreted with caution, we believe that real-time detection of pattern changes are essential to evaluate the current measures of control and design future ones. In this sense, the positive signs already shown by the decreasing trend slopes after a more restrictive lockdown in Italy and Spain could indicate an optimistic and encouraging forecast for those countries that in late March also announced restrictive lockdown measures for flattening the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic curve (e.g., the United Kingdom on March 23th or Ireland on March 27th). These results show that the sacrifices that our society is making are gaining us valuable time, which is essential to get ready to face the future pressures that this epidemic will bring forth. "
117290,"The number of daily confirmed COVID-19 cases in 16 prefecture-level cities in Hubei Province (except for Wuhan), the proportion of daily confirmed COVID-19 cases in 16 prefecture-level cities in the total daily cases in Hubei Province, and the diagnosis rate of COVID-19 per 10,000 persons in 16 prefecture-level cities in Hubei Province were used as our outcomes. More details can be seen in Figs. 1 and 2. Based on the data from Hubei Province, this empirical study comprehensively estimated the relationship between population mobility and the transmission of COVID-19. We found that there was a period of 11-12 days from contact to being confirmed for most infected COVID-19 cases in Hubei Province (except for Wuhan). This was highly in line with the situation that the daily increase in confirmed cases and diagnosis rate began to show significant declines within 9-12 days after the lockdown of 16 prefecture-level cities. The mass population migration during the Spring Festival in 2020 has motivated the transmission of COVID-19, and the lockdown of Wuhan and other Note: *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001. CI: confidence interval. Robust standard error was used in the above models. No other covariate was controlled for in all models in Panel A; spatial distance to Wuhan, per capita GDP, the number of medical and health institutions' beds and healthcare workers per thousand persons, and population density were controlled for in all models in Panel B Fig. 3 Daily confirmed cases of COVID-19 in 5 prefecture-level cities in Hubei Province from January 24th to February 6th, 2020 Jiang and Luo Global Health Research and Policy (2020) 5:30 Page 6 of 10 cities in Hubei Province has effectively mitigated the COVID-19 epidemic. The duration from contact to being confirmed for most COVID-19 cases in Hubei Province was reported to be 11-12 days in this study, which far exceeds the reported 3-7 days incubation period. This is highly in line with the results from Chen and Yu's as well as Kraemer et al.'s studies (about 14 days) [12, 14] . It does not mean that population mobility only has an exact lagging effect (11-12 days) on COVID-19 transmission; by contrast, it indicates the closest relationship between them, and other time lags (e.g., lag-13 days) also matter but are not the most important. Around 9-12 days after the lockdown of 16 prefecture-level cities in Hubei Province (except for Wuhan), the daily increase of confirmed COVID-19 cases showed a significant decline. Some prior studies indicate that the lockdown of Wuhan and other areas was conductive to the control of the COVID-19 epidemic [12, 15, 16] . Specific lockdown interventions, such as travel restrictions and social distancing, are mainly used to reduce population mobility and can help mitigate the COVID-19 epidemic [25] , so our results support the opinion that population mobility is closely related to the transmission of COVID-19 [12, 13, 26, 27] . It should be noted that this 11-12 days period should not be simply considered as the incubation period, but the duration from contact/infection to being confirmed. Most COVID-19 cases in Hubei Province spend 11-12 days from contact/infection to being confirmed, and it particularly reflects a long time from onset to being confirmed and low diagnostic efficiency. On the one hand, Hubei Province faced a shortage of medical and health resources when facing this major public health emergency in the first 3 months of 2020. The number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in Hubei Province had exceeded 60,000 as at February 29th, which accounted for more than 70% of the total confirmed cases in China. This emergency is a challenge to the health service capacity of Hubei Province. The Chinese central government required other neighboring provinces to support Hubei to control the COVID-19 epidemic as soon as possible [28] , and this intervention has achieved a good result. On the other hand, in the first 2 months of 2020, the production and supply of nucleic acid detection reagents were severely inadequate in Hubei Province, which may have delayed the diagnosis of some COVID-19 cases. Nevertheless, this study also found some positive information. Most prefecture-level cities in Hubei Province began to lock down on January 23rd, 24th or 25th, and some cities with severe epidemics in other provinces (e.g., cities in Zhejiang, Henan, Guangdong, and Anhui) also began to implement similar policies in later January or early February to restrict population mobility. According to the roughly estimated turning point of the COVID-19 epidemic in Hubei Province (9-12 days), a nationwide restriction on population mobility can help block the transmission of COVID-19. The fact is that, the turning point of the COVID-19 epidemic in other provinces appeared on around February 14th, which is 10-15 days after their lockdown interventions. Because the lockdown intervention is mainly used to reduce population mobility, the fact that the turning point in most provinces and cities emerged within 10-15 days after their lockdown supports our results more or less. This result is also in line with the opinion that lockdown interventions are most useful in the early and late stages of COVID-19 outbreaks [12] . Furthermore, our findings also support or justify the national policy of requiring a 14-day quarantine before work can resume. There are also some limitations to this study. First, we have no access to the data on the number of persons that traveled from Wuhan to other prefecture-level cities in Hubei Province, so it is hard for us to exactly predict the size of the COVID-19 epidemic, and we only yielded the best fitting lag length of 11-12 days and concluded that the city lockdown in Hubei could help control the epidemic. Second, the daily confirmed COVID-19 cases reflect the cases detected rather than the cases infected, Appendix 1 so there may be measuring errors because not every COVID-19 case can be immediately confirmed. In this case, the influence of population mobility on the COVID-19 epidemic may be underestimated. Finally, many other factors were not considered in this study when analyzing the impact of city lockdown. For example, the COVID-19's prevention and control measures in many regions have been gradually upgraded, which also greatly promotes the arrival of the turning point of the epidemic. However, the sample size of this study was relatively small, the statistical power was moderate, and some confounding factors were hard to control. Therefore, although the results from the RE model (11-12 days) and the first derivative model (9-12 days) are similar, the judgment of the turning point of the epidemic only has moderate reference value and should be treated with caution. This study investigated the influence of population mobility on the transmission of COVID-19. We found that the COVID-19 was more likely to be confirmed within 11-12 days after people moved from Wuhan to other cities in Hubei Province, which suggests a period of 11-12 days from contact to being confirmed. Also, the daily confirmed cases and daily increment in incidence in 16 prefecture-level cities show obvious declines 9-12 days post adaptation of city lockdown. Population mobility is found to be a driver to the transmission of COVID-19, and the city lockdown started from January in Hubei Province has effectively mitigated the COVID-19 epidemic. Thus, strategies such as social distancing and travel restrictions, as well as quarantine no less than 12 days, should be encouraged to fight the COVID-19 pandemic. "
117575,"As we have estimated, the measures taken by the Spanish Government on March 14, 2020 to mitigate the epidemic curve of COVID-19 managed to flatten the curve and although they have not (yet) managed to enter the decrease phase, they are on the way to do so. In fact, just one day after implementing the measures, the variation rate of accumulated cases decreased daily, on average, by 3.059 percentage points, (95% credibility interval: −5.371, −0.879). This reduction will be greater as time passes. In this sense, we estimate that the reduction in the variation rate of the accumulated cases, on the last day in which we have data (April 5, three weeks after the intervention) has reached 5.11 percentage points. An aspect that goes beyond our objective is which of the mitigation strategies that governments have taken has been the most effective. However, using our findings, we could provide some argument for the discussion. Thus, first, looking at Fig. 2a , it seems that the strategy adopted by South Korea has been the most effective, since it has managed to flatten the curve before any other country (between 10 and 15 days after the outbreak). In this same sense, we find that the curves that are most similar to Spain (still growing exponentially, i.e. with a reproductive number greater than one) are those of Italy and China in their first month of evolution (since the outbreak). As for whether confinement in Spain is not sufficient to flatten the curve and should therefore be tightened, our results seem to contradict it. We predict that the rate of change of cumulative cases will be zero (that is, the epidemic curve will flatten) in early April. Our paper could have several limitations. First, estimates of new cases must be interpreted with some caution. It is important to note that under-registration occurs in Spain as a consequence of a lack of tests. It is very possible that when mass screening is carried out, the number of confirmed cases will increase, each time approaching the real incidence. However, we believe that our results on the variation of accumulated cases are much more reliable, since they are not based on the number of cases but on the shape of the epidemic curve, which is very similar in all the countries. Second, our model performs well in the short term (a week at most), limiting it in making predictions about when the epidemic will peak. However, we are convinced of its usefulness in evaluating the measures that can be taken against the epidemic. "
117787,"Despite social distancing and shelter-in-place policies, COVID-19 continues to spread in the United States. A lack of timely information about factors influencing COVID-19 spread and testing has hampered agile responses to the pandemic. We developed How We Feel, an extensible web and mobile application that aggregates self-reported survey responses, to fill gaps in the collection of COVID-19-related data. How We Feel collects longitudinal and geographically localized information on users' health, behavior, and demographics. Here we report results from over 500,000 users in the United States from April 2, 2020 to May 12, 2020. We show that self- reported surveys can be used to build predictive models of COVID-19 test results, which may aid in identification of likely COVID-19 positive individuals. We find evidence among our users for asymptomatic or presymptomatic presentation, as well as for household and community exposure, occupation, and demographics being strong risk factors for COVID-19. We further reveal factors for which users have been SARS-CoV-2 PCR tested, as well as the temporal dynamics of self- reported symptoms and self-isolation behavior in positive and negative users. These results highlight the utility of collecting a diverse set of symptomatic, demographic, and behavioral self- reported data to fight the COVID-19 pandemic."
118084,"We have developed two spatially-explicit models for simulating and addressing the evolution of the COVID pandemic on a regional basis. Results show that the application of a regionallyvarying series of lockdown policies is likely to be just as effective at minimising contagion, while offering advantages of less restrictive rules for part of the population. Trading off some additional complexity in the mitigation for a more liberal lockdown may be important. Bear in mind that to clear a large number of infections (thousands or tens of thousands) requires considerable time, our models show at least 3-4 months being needed in a high lockdown state for scenarios with high case numbers (see Appendix A.6) before it is safe to reduce it and instead rely on contact tracing and isolation. This assumes that the lockdown strategy is adhered to for the duration. During this time, the population may suffer from loss of income, reduced access to healthcare and education, and the stresses of being apart from family and other social networks. All these have negative effects on wellbeing, even if we set aside all economic concerns. At the time of writing New Zealand sits on the cusp of an (initial) eradication of COVID-19, with only three cases reported in the last two weeks. We do not yet know if a regional lockdown policy will be needed here, it may well be that the eight weeks of progressive lockdown we have experienced will be sufficient, given that our case numbers have been small. If not, we may need to use this model in anger. Other places are not so fortunate, and have a pressing need now. Our main findings are summarised as follows: 1. Explicitly spatial models are needed to address the complexities of managing the response to pandemics, they can offer similar performance in terms of case "
118161,"Summary The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic related social lockdown has helped unlock time to give more room to sleep. Although daily stress during lockdown increased, and sleep quality decreased, sleep behaviour was generally healthier, as two novel research papers show."
118169,"The particulate matter (PM 2.5 ) concentrations vary in different locations in different countries depending on the local meteorological conditions. The transmission of infection may also vary like PM 2.5 , depending on the meteorological parameters especially surface air temperature and relative humidity in a closed environment (Wang, and Du, 2020) . Recently, have carried out analysis of PM 2.5 data in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Wuhan cities during COVID-19 and found pronounced reduction in atmospheric pollution attributed to the reduction of emissions in transportation and industries. We have shown changes in the average monthly PM 2.5 data for the months of Dec. -March and compared with the average value of PM 2.5 cities around the world listed above. In some of the cities, and country, partial to complete lockdown were started beginning from January. In the month of March 2020 all the cities considered in the present study observed lockdown, although degree of the lockdown varies. In US, even during no lockdown, people did stay in their houses and tried to maintain ""social distancing"", limit of 6 ft. The traffic on the roads were reduced but the flights, buses and essential services were not stopped. The decline in PM 2.5 compared with other years is attributed to the decline in in traffic in US and also in many cities of the world considered in the present study, except in India where complete lockdown (no domestic and international flights, no trains, complete closure of small and big shopping centres and industry) was observed. The decline in different months in different cities in some countries reflect partial lockdown in different months where large number of people suffer from COVID-19 especially in the month of February and March 2020. In USA, a partial lockdown was observed in the month of March as a result, a linear decline in PM 2.5 was observed in New York and Los Angeles in the month of March 2020 (Figure 2 ). The average PM 2.5 concentrations in New York, is 9.48 µg/m 3 during December 2019 to March 2020. In New York city, pronounced linear reduction (32%) is seen in PM 2.5 during March 2020 compared with March 2019, and 20% with compared to February 2020. In New York, PM 2.5 was reduced due to rainfall in the month of March 2020 (Figure 2) . In Los Angeles, 4% reduction in PM 2.5 is observed during March 2020 with respect to March 2019, about 30% compared with February 2020. Such changes are associated with the lockdown and due to rainfall, clearly showing improvement in air quality. In Zaragoza, Spain, average PM 2.5 concentration is about 29.38 µg/m 3 during December 2019 to March 2020. Significant decline (58%) in PM 2.5 is observed in during March 2020 compared to February 2020. The average PM 2.5 in Rome is 35.0 µg/m 3 since December 2019 to March 2020, the average value of PM 2.5 in the month of March 2020 is similar to March 2019 but it is 24% lower compared with February and 159% compared to the month of January 2020. In Rome, Italy and Zaragoza, Spain during the period considered here, no rainfall occurred. Variations of PM 2.5 in Dubai, UAE: Delhi and Mumbai, India are shown in Figure 1c . In Dubai, PM 2.5 reduced to 11% during March 2020 compared with March 2019. During 2018 and 2019, PM 2.5 increased in the month of March 2020 compared to February 2020 due to rise in temperature, during this time dusts are also common (Otaibi et al. 2019 ) that enhances PM 2.5 . Decline of 6% is found in PM 2.5 concentrations in the month of March 2020 with compared to February 2020 due to partial lockdown in Dubai. In Dubai lockdown was implemented in different phases, in the first phase schools were closed, later shopping malls, small shops and at the last religious places were closed. From the last week of March, night time curfew were imposed. Now a complete lockdown was announced. Due to different phases of lockdown a small change in PM 2.5 was observed in Dubai (personal communication  with  one  of  my  students  Waseem Mehdi and also through  ). Low value of PM 2.5 in the month of January due to cool temperature (Otaibi et al. 2019) , low value was also observed in the month of December 2019. In Indian cities, Delhi and Mumbai (Figure 1c) , a decline of 35% and 14%, respectively, compared to March 2019 is observed. Similar changes are also observed in Beijing and Shanghai cities of China (Figure 1d ). In both cities, lockdown started in mid of February 2020. The effect of decrease in PM 2.5 is observed in the month of March 2020. In Beijing, a decline of 50% is observed whereas in Shanghai PM 2.5 was decline half of PM 2.5 concentration in the month of March 2019. In Dubai, Delhi, Mumbai, Beijing and Shanghai no rainfall was observed in the month of March 2020 Variations of PM 2.5 depends on season to season, and months to months, depending upon the anthropogenic activities, dust events, crop residue burning and emissions from traffic. Due to total lockdown, the PM 2.5 is declined in New Delhi and Mumbai in the month of March 2020, much lower compared to other months and other years 2017-2019 (Figure 1c ). Similar decline in PM 2.5 is observed in Beijing and Shanghai (Fig. 1d) and Zaragoza, Spain ( Figure  1b) . In US cities, New York and Los Angeles pronounced decline in PM 2.5 clearly show impact of lockdown. The lockdown around the world helped to curb the pollution and to break chain of spread of virus. Many nations ordered for the total lockdown within city or state or in whole country (e.g. India). Such conditions helped in improving the air quality which is directly reflected by the decline in PM 2.5 . The decline also suggests less movement of traffic, which directly shows lockdown and observing social distancing. Here, we have not discussed about the greenhouse emissions monitored using ground sensors in most of the cities, and such data are available through satellite also. A preliminary data analysis shows pronounced decline in the greenhouse emissions in most of the cities due to complete lockdown when practically no traffic on the roads. Such reduction in greenhouse emissions will have local, regional and global impact in radiation budget which will have a long-term impact on climate.  "
118284,"While mathematical models do not provide a cure for a given infectious disease,they are however used to replicate possible scenarios of the dynamic at hand. The new deadly COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan China, has led to millions of infected, more than 150,0 0 0 deaths around the globe. Researchers and many other sectors have devoted their attention to flatten the curve of infection and deaths in the last past months. While humanity is waiting for a possible vaccine, they have introduced temporary measures including lock-down and social distancing to help control the spread and save lives from all corners of the globe. In this paper, using data from Italy, we presented some basic statistical figures to give an indication of the spread profile. These results helped to construct a mathematical model that takes into account the effect of lock-down. New fractal-fractional differential and integral operators were proposed and applied to the introduced mathematical model. Some numerical simulations indicated the efficiency of the lock-down. In our future work, we will include the effect of vaccine. "
119491,"Were southern hemisphere countries right to undertake national lockdown during their summer time? Were they right to blindly follow the self-isolation wave that hit European countries in full winter? As a southern hemisphere country like South Africa stands now as the most COVID-19 and HIV affected country in Africa, we use in this paper, recent COVID-19 data to provide a statistical and comparative analysis that may alert southern hemisphere countries entering the winter season. After that, we use a generalized simple mathematical model of HIV-COVID-19 together with graphs, curves and tables to compare the pandemic situation in countries that were once the epicenter of the the disease, such as China, Italy, Spain, United Kingdom (UK) and United States of America (USA). We perform stability and bifurcation analysis and show that the model contains a forward and a backward bifurcation under certain conditions. We also study different scenarios of stability/unstability equilibria for the model. The fractional (generalized) COVID-19 model is solved numerically and a predicted prevalence for the COVID-19 is provided. Recall that Brazil and South Africa share number of similar social features like Favellas (Brazil) and Townships (South Africa) with issues like promiscuity, poverty, and where social distanciation is almost impossible to observe. We can now ask the following question: Knowing its HIV situation, is South Africa the next epicenter in weeks to come when winter conditions, proven to be favorable to the spread of the new coronavirus are comfily installed?"
120828,"In this report, we have described technical details of a model of SARS-CoV-2 transmission and COVID-19 disease progression developed to support public health decision-making in Connecticut. The model is calibrated to the observed dynamics of hospitalizations and cumulative deaths in Connecticut; its projections reproduce these dynamics accurately. Many COVID-19 models have been developed and analyzed by the CDC in the attempt to perform ensemble forecasting of the epidemic development in the US [2] . Some of these models offer state-level projections [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] . The CDC publishes updates of consolidated summary of cumulative death projections in the next four weeks from these models for each state. Local projections from nation-wide models may offer useful insights, however simplifying or uniform assumptions made in most of these models may not hold in all of the locations. There is substantial uncertainty about epidemiological parameters that govern aspects of COVID-19 dynamics and have a direct impact on the quality of projections. When local context is not directly taken into account, the effects of parametric uncertainty is exacerbated. State and county-level models are needed to support local decision-making. Our model captures distinct important features of COVID-19 dynamics and the relationship between model features and data reporting in Connecticut. By calibrating model parameters to local data, including changes in hospitalization capacity, and the exact timing of intervention events, we can reduce uncertainty in projections. However, the calibrated posterior distribution of model parameters is not necessarily generalizable to other settings: model projections are tightly linked to the Connecticut reopening plans. In addition to providing predictions for policymakers, model projections may be useful for prospectively planning epidemiological studies that can inform the state's response. In particular, planning of seroprevalence surveys requires estimates of the proportion of population who have evidence of prior exposure to the virus. Due to limited 18 . CC-BY 4.0    "
120953,"A summary of the results of the inverse UQ analysis is presented in Table A Concerning the non-pharmaceutical interventions adopted by the countries, there are also interesting differences. S. Korea has rapidly adopted an effective 165 isolation strategy of infected individuals during the initial stage of the epidemic, followed by social distance and lock-down policies. This was well characterized by the model via the parameter r, which models the reduction of transmission. For the case of S. Korea, r was as low as 9% (which would correspond to 91% of the population respecting social distancing). For Brazil, a poor reduction 170 of transmission was observed, with r as high as 60% (or only 40% at social isolation). And in this case, even considering the high uncertainties revealed by the large variance of this PDF, see Figure 1 , the values of r in Brazil are much higher than those of Italy, which are higher than those of S. Korea. For S. Korea, the estimated parameter e, which reflects the reduction in the influx 175 of infected people from outside the country, was also the lowest one, near 1.0 × 10 −6 , see Table A The parameter that models the notification of cases also varied among the different countries. The estimation of notification of infected cases in S. Korea is very high, around 95%, while in Brazil and Italy the notification is around 10% and 30%, respectively. Therefore, the number of infected cases (I) in these 185 two countries is between 3 to 10 times the number of reported cases (I r ). These differences on percentage of notification correlates with the different dynamics observed so far in these three countries. Indeed, S. Korea has successfully tested its population and is an example of less underreported cases [45] , furthermore it is also an example of a country that has decreased the infection curve [3] . Brazil has the largest estimated value for underreported cases (see Table A In this work, the contact reduction, a(t), was modeled as a linear function that decays from 1 to r. After ∆ days, a(t) remains constant at r. It is a simplification, where we only consider a single intervention in terms of restriction policy. Nevertheless, this single intervention was enough to recover the very distinct dynamics observed in the three countries. Multiple phases of social 235 distancing policies could be implemented in future works. Also, other timedependent functions could be used for a(t), instead of a linear one, such as the exponential decay used in [23] . For describing the influx of infected individuals the function f (t) = eP (t) was adopted, where P (t) was described by an exponential: P (t) = c 0 exp (c 1 t). "
121166,The Australian and New Zealand governments both initiated strict social distancing measures in response to the COVID-19 pandemic in late March. It remains difficult to quantify the impact this had in reducing the spread of the virus. Bayesian structural time series model provide a model to quantify the scenario in which these government-level interventions were not placed. Our models predict these strict social distancing measures caused a 79% and 61% reduction in the daily cases of COVID-19 across Australia and New Zealand respectively. This provides both evidence and impetus for governments considering similar measures in response to COVID-19 and other pandemics.
121335,"The authors attempted to understand the effect of COVID-19 spread in a hydrosphere using remote sensing data products. We selected one of the severely polluted freshwater lakes in India to evaluate the impact of the lockdown due to the COVID-19 spread on water quality. The analysis of SPM concentrations in Vembanad lake based on the Landsat-8 OLI data revealed that the concentrations during the lockdown period were lower than those in the pre-lockdown period by 15.9% on average (-10.3% -36.4%). The decrease was observed in 18 out of 20 zones of the lake. Eleven of the zones showed that the concentration was the lowest in April of 2013 -2020 (Table A .1). While non-industrial pollution (e.g. discharge of domestic wastewater) remained during the lockdown period, our results suggested that pollution from industries and tourism had a severe impact on lake water quality. As we have limited satellite data during the lockdown period, further analysis using longer time-series data that include the post-lockdown period (presumably starting from 3 rd May 2020) is needed to confirm the effect of industrial pollution load on lake water quality. Another potential extension of this work is to apply MODIS Terra 250 m archived data to derive the time series SPM that dates back to the year 2000. One of the advantages of the remote-sensing-based water quality analysis (over on-site observation) is that we can evaluate past water quality as long as cloud-free satellite images are available. We recommend similar works in other environmental settings to understand the overall impact of COVID-19 in the hydrosphere. Since the atmospheric components and hydrosphere are closely linked, we also tracked the weather data and atmospheric pollution level in the study region. The atmospheric pollution (PM 2.5 , PM 10 , and NO 2 ) data for the study area obtained from the state pollution board showed that the air quality was drastically improved since the first day of the lockdown ( Fig. A.2b ). While the climatic condition in April 2020 was not different from those in other years ( Fig. A.2a) , the particulate matter concentrations (both PM 2.5 and PM 10 ) in April 2020 was much lower than those in 2019, suggesting a considerable improvement in the pollution level during the lockdown (Fig. A.2c) . Although associating atmospheric particulate matter with suspended particulate matter in the lake is premature at this point, the improvement in environmental quality was observed in both atmosphere and hydrosphere. Our findings also draw further attention to what will happen after the lockdown period. The lake is surrounded by densely populated areas (810 inhabitants/km 2 ) (Narayanan and Venot, 2009 ). The industries, tourism activities, and other businesses (e.g. hotels and restaurants) are planned to re-open in a phased manner from 3 rd May 2020. Although the socio-economic effect of COVID-19 spread will remain for some period, the pollutants eventually return to the lake from the industrial activities. Declared as a location of international importance under the Ramsar Convention, also located in the coastal zone, there are rules and regulations formulated to preserve the Vembanad lake ecosystem. But it seems less action being taken on the ground level. Our work showed that the pollutant level decreased considerably when industries and boating being suspended.

121449,"This paper defines and proposes the calibration of an index ( that is devoted to predicting the risk of -) contagion in urban district by considering epidemic, characteristic and social data of the territory. The methodology is based on a multicriteria approach that starts on the well-known definition of the risk by means of three factors: hazard, vulnerability and exposure. Hence, the singled-out criteria and sub-criteria are considered in the definition of index by factorial formula that is calibrated by solving a mathematical programming problem. -In particular, the calibration exploited a nonlinear optimization technique and the real data regarding the spreading epidemic of the Covid-19 in the 257 Apulian urban districts. Moreover, in order to verify the effectiveness of the factorial formula, the proposed is compared with the analysis obtained by training an ANN. "
121888,"Currently, the best advice from public health authorities are sending the prominent messages that in order to contain the coronavirus pandemic, people must take their actions to change their behavior. One of the important behaviors is 'social distancing'. This is the first country-level research to examine the role of cultural factors on driving the efficiency of social distancing by using two dataset such as the Google trackback and the extended Hofstede (2001) . In reality, the human behaviors about social distancing are heterogeneous across the countries. Currently, the world needs to obtain the systematic actions from many countries and regions to ask people to perform the social distancing as the forced legitimation. However, people are allowed to go to grocery, pharmacy, transit stations, or parks, and so forth, as their necessity needs. This also has the potential risks to infect and to be infected. Thus, this study found that the country with higher 'Uncertainty Avoidance Index' from the Hofstede (2001) dimension has less proportion in gathering at these abovementioned public areas. However, we do not find any evidence to explain the changes in the proportion of people staying at residential places. Our study also confirms the finding from Borg (2014) This is understandable to let people understand that they might have potential incubation period to infect to the others. In addition, this should be taken into account when interacting with the strangers in the public might increase the risky likelihood to get the coronavirus. Our study provides an evidence that public health strategies and interventions should be immediately taken actions to reduce the social gathering by 'uncertainty avoidance' factor. Our study has been analyzed much more rapidly from preliminary evaluation than would be standard for research of this type. Therefore the further research about the cultural factors and the efficiency of social distancing need to be examined to draw more conclusions to the health authorities to the pandemics. "
121987,"ABSTRACT Introduction: As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic in France, all non-emergency surgical activity has been cancelled since March 12, 2020. In order to anticipate the reinstatement of delayed interventions, surgical activity reduction analysis is essential. The objective of this study was to evaluate the reduction of urological surgery in adult during the COVID-19 pandemic compared to 2019. Material: The data regarding urological procedures realized in the 8 academic urological departments of Parisians centres (AP-HP) were compared over two similar periods (14-29 March 2019 and 12-27 March 2020) using the centralized surgical planning software shared by these centres. Procedure title, type of surgery and outpatient ratio were collected. The interventions were sorted into 16 major families of urological interventions. Results: Overall, a 55% decrease was observed concerning urological procedures over the same period between 2019 and 2020 (995 and 444 procedures respectively). Oncology activity and emergencies decreased by 31% and 44%. The number of kidney transplantations decreased from 39 to 3 (-92%). Functional, andrological and genital surgical procedures were the most impacted among the non-oncological procedures (-85%, -81% and -71% respectively). Approximatively 1033 hours of surgery have been delayed during this 16-day period. Conclusion: Lockdown and postponement of non-urgent scheduled urological procedures decisions has led to a drastic decrease in surgical activity in AP-HP. Isolated Kidney transplantation has been stopped (national statement). Urologists must anticipate for lockdown exit in order to catch-up delayed surgeries."
122370,"The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of the Spanish confinement for the control of the COVID-19 pandemic on the behavior of pet cats and dogs, and the support that pets provided to their owners. We found that the quality of life owners was strongly influenced by the lifestyle and emotional effects of the confinement, and that pets provided them with substantial support to mitigate those effects. However, pets showed signs of behavioral change that were consistent with stress, with dogs that had pre-existing behavioral problems being the most affected."
123638,"It has been confirmed that the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) can transmit through droplets created when an infected human coughs or sneezes. Accordingly, 1.83-m (6-feet) social distancing is advised to reduce the spread of the disease among humans. This is based on the assumption that no air circulation exists around people. However, it is not well investigated whether the ambient wind and relative humidity (RH) will cause SARS-CoV-2 laden droplets to transport farther in the air, making the current social distancing policy insufficient. To provide evidence and insight into the “social distancing” guidelines, a validated computational fluid-particle dynamics (CFPD) model was employed to simulate the transient transport, condensation/evaporation, and deposition of SARS-CoV-2 laden droplets emitted by coughs, with different environmental wind velocities and RHs. Initial droplet diameters range from 2 to 2000 μm, and the wind velocities range from 0 to 16 km/h, representing different wind forces from calm air to moderate breeze. The comparison between a steady-state wind and a gust with a constant frequency has also been performed. Ambient RHs are 40% and 99.5%. The distances between the two virtual humans are 1.83 m and 3.05 m (6 feet and 10 feet). The facial covering effect on reducing the airborne transmission of the cough droplets has also been evaluated. Numerical results indicate that the ambient wind will enhance the complexity of the secondary flows with recirculation between the two virtual humans. Microdroplets follow the airflow streamlines well and deposit on both human bodies and head regions, even with the 3.05-m (10-feet) separation distance. The rest of the microdroplets can transport in the air farther than 3.05 m (10 feet) due to wind convection, causing a potential health risk to nearby people. High RH will increase the droplet sizes due to the hygroscopic growth effect, which increases the deposition fractions on both humans and the ground. With the complex environmental wind and RH conditions, the 6-feet social distancing policy may not be sufficient to protect the inter-person aerosol transmission, since the suspending micro-droplets were influenced by convection effects and can be transported from the human coughs/sneezes to the other human in less than 5 s. Thus, due to the complex real-world environmental ventilation conditions, a social distance longer than 6 feet needs to be considered. Wearing masks should also be recommended for both infected and healthy humans to reduce the airborne cough droplet numbers."
124560,"The new coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has required the implementation of severe mobility restrictions and social distancing measures worldwide. While these measures have been proven effective in abating the epidemic in several countries, it is important to estimate the effectiveness of testing and tracing strategies to avoid a potential second wave of the COVID-19 epidemic. We integrate highly detailed (anonymized, privacy-enhanced) mobility data from mobile devices, with census and demographic data to build a detailed agent-based model to describe the transmission dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 in the Boston metropolitan area. We find that enforcing strict social distancing followed by a policy based on a robust level of testing, contact-tracing and household quarantine, could keep the disease at a level that does not exceed the capacity of the health care system. Assuming the identification of 50% of the symptomatic infections, and the tracing of 40% of their contacts and households, which corresponds to about 9% of individuals quarantined, the ensuing reduction in transmission allows the reopening of economic activities while attaining a manageable impact on the health care system. Our results show that a response system based on enhanced testing and contact tracing can play a major role in relaxing social distancing interventions in the absence of herd immunity against SARS-CoV-2."
125829,"This study brings together how the Indian optometry educational system has responded to COVID-19 disruptions using findings of the 2020 survey, in light of findings of the 2018 survey 16 , combined with authors' experiences and observations in academia. The COVID-19 pandemic and its disruptions have created an opportunity for the restructuring of the optometry educational system. The quick transitions to online mode assisted in keeping continuity of optometry education programs, effectively fitting in the purpose of completion of the current academic year. Clearly, the journey from the tea steeping model of education to a competency-based learning program has commenced. Online teaching, use of internet technology in optometry education are set to become a new normal. The transition can be quick and smooth if educators and technical staff show an adaptive and collaborative attitude. It is, however, very early to conclude the successful narrative of transition as the judgment of students' performance and quality of passing out professionals is yet to be realized. Further studies may be directed to test student's performance and satisfaction on switching to the e-learning educational system. "
126318,"Brazil is currently in the autumn season, and thus under good conditions to pollutant dispersion. During winter season São Paulo commonly faces the temperature inversion phenomena, when the air pollutants reach their peaks. Meteorological monitoring data bulletin made available by the São Paulo State Environmental Agency (CETESB, 2020) show that favorable conditions to pollutant dispersion were found both before partial lockdown (February 25 -March 23) and during partial lockdown (March 24 -April 20), therefore indicating that observed pollutant reductions were not highly determined by changes in dispersion conditions. Before partial lockdown, in a few days (March 11 -17) adverse conditions to ozone dispersion were observed, and in the same period ozone peaks were detected. In the industrial area we observed low levels of variation when compared to the five-year monthly mean (2015-2019), and also concentration increases of all analyzed pollutants when compared to the period before the partial lockdown (Table 1) . It is important to mention that the industry was not ordered to lockdown, albeit some industrial sectors have been affected by decreasing demand. In the urban area we observed significant air quality improvements considering decreases in air pollutants monitored in areas highly influenced by vehicle traffic (Urban Road I, Urban Road Journal Pre-proof J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 6 II and City center) (Table 1 and Figure 1 ). High reductions of air pollutants concentration were found during partial lockdown compared to the five-year monthly mean (variation A), while significant reductions were found in comparison to the period before partial lockdown (variation B). Drastic reductions on NO (−48.6%, −77.3% and −72.7% in Urban Road I, Urban Road II and City center, respectively), NO 2 (−30.1%, −54.3% and −46.5% in Urban Road I, Urban Road II and City center, respectively) and CO (−36.1%, −53.1% and −64.8% in Urban Road I, Urban Road II and City center, respectively) concentrations were observed in the urban area during partial lockdown compared to the five-year monthly mean. In São Paulo -SP, road traffic accounts for approximately 68% of NOx and 98% of CO emissions (Andrade et al. 2017) . One recent research has demonstrated that traffic emissions from heavy-duty diesel trucks are major sources of NO (He et al. 2020) . During the partial lockdown, vehicle traffic considerably decreased in all analyzed areas, positively affecting the air quality. Decreases in pollutant concentrations in Urban Road I were lower than in the other analyzed areas, probably because this urban road is the connecting route for several highways and also is the main route in São Paulo. <  "
126766,"We tested 104 residents and 141 staff for COVID-19 who failed daily symptom screening in homeless shelters in Hamilton, Canada. We detected one resident (1%), seven staff (5%) and one case of secondary spread. Shelter restructuring to allow physical distancing, testing and isolation can decrease outbreaks in shelters."
127326,"Based on the model fitting that was carried out in this work, with three sets of data, we observe an approximately similar estimates for the β c , ψ, θ and the control reproduction number R c but some significant variations for the initial values of individuals in the E, A and I classes. Figures 2, 8 and 14 showed that our model fits well to the data, irrespective of the data set used. However, we observed that the significant difference in the values of the initial conditions (E(0), A(0) and I(0)) gave markedly different projections for the number of cumulative reported cases and the number of active cases, even when the different runs gave good model fits to the data being used (as shown in Figures 3, 9 and 15 ). This strongly reveals that our lack of knowledge and understanding of how long community transmission may have been going on in the population (as at the time the first (index) case was announced on March 16, 2020) could hinder our knowledge of the actual burden of COVID-19 in Lagos. Hence, very strict measures must be taken to identify other cases as quickly as possible, through aggressive screening and testing of the population, especially for asymptomatic cases, and strict enforcement of the other control measures. This work has revealed the impact of different non-pharmaceutical control measures on the population dynamics of the novel coronavirus disease 2019 in Lagos, Nigeria, using an appropriately formulated mathematical model. Using the available data, since its first reported case on 16 March 2020, we developed a predicative tool for the cumulative number of reported cases and the number of active cases in Lagos; we also estimated the basic reproduction number of the disease outbreak in the aforementioned State in Nigeria. Using numerical simulations, we showed the effect of control measures, specifically the common social distancing, use of face mask and case detection (via contact tracing and subsequent testings) on the dynamics of COVID-19. We also provided forecasts for the cumulative number of reported cases and active cases for different levels of the control measures being implemented. Numerical simulations of the model show that if at least 55% of the population comply with the social distancing regulation with about 55% of the population effectively making use of face masks while in public, the disease will eventually die out in the population and that, if we can step up the case detection rate for symptomatic individuals to about 0.8 per day, with about 55% of the population complying with the social distancing regulations, it will lead to a great decrease in the incidence (and prevalence) of COVID-19. Therefore, to curtail the spread of COVID-19 at the community level, this study recommends, as a matter of urgency, very strict measures to be taken by policy makers and those in authority to identify new cases, through aggressive screening and testing of the population and strict enforcement of the use of face-masks and the social distancing regulations. The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper. "
127526,"During the COVID-19 control period, human activities have been lowered greatly, causing significant reductions in industrial operations, VKT, constructions and other activities which further leads to emissions reduction. During the most stringent Level I response period, the primary pollutants like SO 2 , NO x , PM 2.5 and VOCs have been reduced by 26%, 47%, 46% and 57%, this caused a decrease of PM 2.5 concentrations by 25.4% to 48.1% over the YRD region. However, the daily PM 2.5 still ranges between 15-79 μg m -3 during the lockdown period, and O 3 rebounded by 20.5% simultaneously. Source apportionment results show that PM 2.5 during lockdown periods mainly comes from industry and residential sources. This indicates that the co-control of PM 2.5 and O 3 is quite challenging, more stringent measures like adjustment of enrgy structure and industrial J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 22 structure, more stringent regional joint-control within YRD and even between YRD and northern China areas should be pushed forward to achive a better air quality.

127551,"The above findings suggest that both Canadian elites and the mass public are in a moment of cross-partisan consensus on COVID-19. MPs of all parties have increasingly emphasized the crisis and reinforced the messages of mainstream expert communities. At the aggregate level, there is no evidence of a relationship between the partisan leanings of municipalities and interest in the coronavirus; at the individual-level, very small partisan differences generally disappear when controlling for ideology and demographics. Unlike in the United States, response to the coronavirus is not structured by partisanship, at least at the moment. As the crisis wears on and economic costs mount, it is essential that Canadian parties maintain a united front to avoid eroding this unique moment of societal consensus.

128787,"In this paper, a data-driven forecasting/estimation method has been used to estimate the possible number of positive cases of COVID-19 in India for the next 30 days. The number of recovered cases, daily positive cases, deceased cases have also been estimated by using LSTM and curve fitting. The effect of preventing measures like social isolation and lockdown has also been observed which shows that by these preventive measures, spread of the virus can be reduced significantly. "
128833,"As there is no vaccination and proper medicine for treatment, the recent pandemic caused by COVID-19 has drawn attention to the strategies of quarantine and other governmental measures, like lockdown, media coverage on social isolation, and improvement of public hygiene, etc to control the disease. The mathematical model can help when these intervention measures are the best strategies for disease control as well as how they might affect the disease dynamics. Motivated by this, in this article, we have formulated a mathematical model introducing a quarantine class and governmental intervention measures to mitigate disease transmission. We study a thorough dynamical behavior of the model in terms of the basic reproduction number. Further, we perform the sensitivity analysis of the essential reproduction number and found that reducing the contact of exposed and susceptible humans is the most critical factor in achieving disease control. To lessen the infected individuals as well as to minimize the cost of implementing government control measures, we formulate an optimal control problem, and optimal control is determined. Finally, we forecast a short-term trend of COVID-19 for the three highly affected states, Maharashtra, Delhi, and Tamil Nadu, in India, and it suggests that the first two states need further monitoring of control measures to reduce the contact of exposed and susceptible humans."
129696,"The study objective is to contemplate the effectiveness of COVID-19 on the air pollution of Indian territory from January 2020 to April 2020. We have executed data from European Space Agency (ESA) and CPCB online portal for air quality data dissemination. The Sentinel – 5 P satellite images elucidate that the Air quality of Indian territory has been improved significantly during COVID-19. Mumbai and Delhi are one of the most populated cities. These two cities have observed a substantial decrease in Nitrogen Dioxide (40–50%) compared to the same period last year. It suggests that the emergence of COVID-19 has been proved to a necessary evil as being advantageous for mitigating air pollution on Indian territory during the lock-down. The study found a significant decline in Nitrogen Dioxide in reputed states of India, i.e., Delhi and Mumbai. Moreover, a faded track of Nitrogen Dioxide can be seen at the Maritime route in the Indian Ocean. An upsurge in the environmental quality of India will also be beneficial for its neighbor countries, i.e., China, Pakistan, Iran, and Afghanistan."
130047,"Important variations were observed when the Rt was calculated using the parameters of or (Nishiura et al. 2020 ). The differences between both serial intervals are related to the infectious probability time, which was higher for Li et al. To analyze the initial phases of the outbreak, we preferred to use Nishiuria et al.'s (2020) parameters. The findings using these parameters show more conservative scenarios and less variation than previous studies made in other regions of the world (Yuan et al. 2020; Zhang et al. 2020 ). The Rt estimates in the first ten days of the COVID-19 pandemic were higher in some of the Latin American countries compared to the European referents. The aggressive dynamics of the outbreak in countries such as Brazil, Ecuador and Panama should be considered by surveillance systems in order to provide a quick response and stricter containment strategies. Despite the fact that the estimated Rt for Colombia, Peru, Chile and Mexico were lower than the European ones, the variation with respect to them is minimal. All Latin American countries had R t greater than 2, indicating an exponential growth. There is a high probability that the capacity of the Latin American healthcare systems is overwhelmed. Furthermore, the COVID-19 pandemic could have serious repercussions in the region, given the context of politically divided countries, social inequality, economic limitations, internal conflicts, and social protests (Rodriguez-Morales et al. 2020 ).

130507,"As the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) takes its course outside China, the number of imported cases to other countries is on the rise. Currently, Tanzania has received the first imported case on 16 March 2020. This letter serves to describe this specific event and put forth a number of recommendations including establishing more testing points, discouraging all forms of public and religious gatherings, and tailoring a unique model for lockdown and social distancing to prevent further spread of the disease. The letter has also suggested ways to further improve the efforts already in place so as to strengthen the prevention and control system."
130597,"""All models are wrong, but some are useful"". This famous statement, attributed to the statistician George Box, sums up the usefulness of our model. Although it is not possible to predict the exact number of infected individuals, the model allows describing, in a qualitative way, the influence that different measures can have to mitigate the spreading of the coronavirus during a sports competition. In that sense, we first investigated the effects of reducing the number of days between matches. Interestingly, we observed that this fact resulted in a substantial reduction in the number of infected players at the end of the season (see Fig. 2A ). This result could seem counterintuitive, since reducing the frequency of matches would promote the spreading speed of the coronavirus between teams. However, the fact that the season would be more compressed also results in a reduction of the exposure time to external infections, being the latter a factor with a major influence on the final number of infected players. Next, we investigated the consequences of modifying the number of days between PCR tests. Let us remark that antibody and antigen tests should be ruled out in this context because they are not effective until the disease is well advanced. As expected, we observed that the tests should be as accurate as possible and should be carried out continuously along with the competition, with the optimum scenario being one test per day (see Figs. 2B-D). The analysis of the statistical behaviour of the numerical results yields that, in spite of the complexity of the model, the system at the end of the season can be described as a compound Poisson process (see Fig. 3 ). Regarding the large unpredictability associated to it we conclude that, while qualitative results are clear and lead to behaviour strategies easy to follow by the sports organizations, obtaining precise predictions for a single realisation -the real case-is not possible. This is in agreement with recent work that warns about the strong sensitivity to parameter values in epidemics modelling [24] . We must also note that applying all the measures suggested by the model involves a cost. On the one hand, reducing the time between matches can be very physically demanding. The recovery time after a match would be reduced and the risk of injury would increase. To reduce this risk, teams should increase player rotations. Regarding the tests, football clubs should provide the necessary support and means to carry out such a high number of tests in such a short time. Without an adequate policy in this regard, the risk of reinfection in a competition would skyrocket. Players will also pay a personal cost to control the eventual spreading of coronavirus. Minimising their contacts with other individuals would mean limiting their travels, public events and, in general, reducing interactions with people outside the family environment. In fact, maintaining them in confinement during the rest of the season would be obviously the optimum situation. Finally, although the results shown here are focused on the resumption of the men's Spanish national league, the conclusions are equally valid for the women's competition. Furthermore, the model could be adapted to any competition in which matches involve some physical contact between players, such as basketball, handball or rugby. "
130955,"Human-related production and consumption activities generate pollution The empirical analysis revealed that travel restriction measures taken in 44 cities in northern China significantly reduced air pollution emissions. On average, the AQI decreased by 7.80%, and the concentration of five air pollutants (SO 2 , PM 2.5 , PM 10 , NO 2 , and CO) decreased by 6.76%, 5.93%, 13.66%, 24.67%, and 4.58%, respectively. To guarantee the robustness of our results, we re-estimated our model by incorporating city-specific time trends into our model and by changing the panel size. We additionally conducted RDD estimation, and obtained similar results with our baseline regression. For further research, we investigated the mediating role of human mobility on the relationship between travel restrictions and air pollution. A meaningful finding was that sharp reductions in human mobility were strongly associated with air pollution reduction. In particular, the reduction of AQI, PM 2.5 , and CO were partially mediated by individual movement, and SO 2 , PM 10 , and NO 2 were J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f fully mediated. Our findings imply that human-related activities are strongly associated with air quality. Although travel restrictions cannot apply to air pollution prevention and control, it is possible to improve air quality by reducing nonessential individual movements by highlighting the importance of green commuting. We also provided possible reasons for upgrading industry structure and eliminating heavily polluting industry production. This is not sufficient, however, to avoid severe air pollution because, other than PM 10 and NO 2 , the reduction ratios of AQI and the other three air pollutants were small. In contrast, although we recorded a temporary decline in air pollution resulting from the economic downturn, it is hard to maintain this reduction after China's workforce gradually returns to work. Our study highlighted the importance of understanding the role of green production and consumption. Our analysis has several limitations. We could not investigate the impact of all elements of a city's emergency response and its long-term dynamic effects because of a lack of data. It is not yet clear which parts of the national emergency response were most effective in reducing air pollution. In summary, we applied statistical and quantitative analyses of the relationships among air pollution, human mobility, and travel restrictions to make inferences about these effects on air pollution.

131639,"We assessed the correlation between daily movement and estimated R t over time. We observed strong positive correlation between movement and R t initially followed by a drop in this correlation as China began to remove movement restrictions and restart their economy. These results provide evidence that China's containment strategies are continuing to be effective as they restart their economy. This work is an analysis of correlation, not causation. While within-city movement undoubtedly affects R t , this analysis does not infer causation. To estimate R t , we used confirmed case reports; however, confirmed cases are only a proportion of the total number of infected individuals. Therefore, our estimates of R t may be biased if the proportion of cases being detected varied substantially over short periods of time. These results should be considered when other countries use movement data to assess the impact of disease control interventions. While reductions in movement appear to be necessary in the short term, it appears that China rapidly managed to restart key elements of economic activity without increasing transmission. Therefore, while movement data are important, the decorrelation between movement and transmission becomes a goal for any exit strategy. This project contains the following extended data: -china_exit_supp_mat.pdf (supplementary material containing Table S1 , Figure S1 and Figure S2 ) It might be worth updating the case counts and deaths in the introduction. Please clarify your definition of Rt in the methods. It is the average number of new cases generated by all cases INFECTED at time t, or with ONSET on time t, or it is the average number of new cases INFECTED at time t from active cases at time t, or it is the average number of new ONSETS on time t, from active cases some time before that? Your serial interval seems a little high. Does the lag for the correlations support an interval with mean/median 4d instead? Rt for HK in January seems very high. Please double check the data for this. I found Figure 2 really difficult to parse, with three quite incongruent data types being presented. Perhaps if the correlations were slightly offset it would be easier to visualize? I have similar difficulties with F3b. Thank you for giving me the opportunity to read this interesting paper.

132363,"We have combined a power law with an exponential law with our segmented Poisson model to analyze the COVID-19 daily new cases data for six major Western countries in the G-7 group. It is seen from Figures 1-3 that the observed and estimated daily new cases are in good agreement. This together with the forecasted trend indicated that our model has well characterized the COVID-19 outbreaks in these six major Western countries. Our analysis allowed us to identify/predict the turning point, to predict the further spread, the duration and the final size (the attack rate) of the outbreak of COVID-19 in those six countries we studied. We found that among those six countries, France would ). If the current government actions remain unchanged, the outbreaks would likely to end at the beginning of June (ranging from May 21 to June 10) and the average duration of the outbreaks is 127 days (ranging from 115 to 138 days). It is seen from Tables 1 and 2 that the estimated parameter γ 1 's are all negative (except for Italy's, which is close to zero), and all γ 2 's are positive. This implies that if there were no major enforcement actions on control strategies such as lockdowns, social distancing, stayhome-advises/orders, then the COVID-19 would have spread exponentially. For example, the total confirmed cases in the USA would have passed 1, 000, 000 on April 05, 2020. This indicates that the interentions/actions greatly reduced the outbreak sizes and flatted the epidemic curves. Our prediction is based on the assumption that the current government interventions/actions would be imposed until the estimated end dates of the outbreaks. If those interventions were lifted or removed earlier cautiously based on scientific evidences, we would not expect any dramatic differences. On the other hand, if those interventions were lifted or removed earlier hastily without scientific support, our prediction would provide a reference to assess consequences of such irresponsible decisions.

133305,"The power-law growth of the cumulative number of confirmed infected individuals by the COVID-19 until March 27, 2020, is shown to be the best descriptive scenario for the countries Brazil, China, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Spain, Republic of Korea, and USA. Distinct power-law exponents for the countries are found and summarized in Table I . The power-law behavior suggests that the underlying propagation dynamics of the virus around these countries follows scale free networks, fractal kinetics, and small world features. 5, 6, 9 While power-laws with distinct exponents may look visually similar, it is necessary to quantify this similarity. For this, we compute the Distance Correlation 10-12 between all countries mentioned above (not shown). However, we use results for the DC from representative countries from four continents, namely, Brazil, Italy, Japan, and USA (see Fig. 2 ). They show that the power-law growth between these countries are highly correlated, even between North and South Hemispheres. The high correlation between the powerlaw curves of different continents strongly suggest that government strategies can be applied with success around the whole world. Furthermore, we propose a variation in the well known SEIR epidemic model 19, 20 for predictions using (or not) distinct government strategies applied on March 28, 2020. We apply numerically distinct strategies to flatten (or not) the power-law curves. Even though the social isolation, a well known benefit, is very powerful to flatten the curves, we found other strategies which lead to comparable results. For Italy and France, for example, the best scenario was obtained when reducing the social interaction to θ = 0.8 (light blue curves). However, if 5% of the asymptomatic and mild symptomatic individuals are identified and isolated everyday (κ a = 0.05), asymptotic values of the same order of magnitude for the symptomatic cases were obtained even if θ = 1.0 (magentadashed curve). On the other hand, for Brazil and USA, our simulations confirm that to keep the social distance is essential to decrease the asymptotic number of infected individuals, and even better results could be obtained by increasing the tests to identify and isolate asymptomatic and mild symptomatic individuals (compare light blue and orange curves). The above combination between social interaction and the huge degree of isolation of infected individuals could be implemented to prevent economic catastrophes because people are not working. In other words, let some essential individuals go back to work (increasing θ ) and, simultaneously, increase by a huge amount the number of daily tests and isolation of infected individuals. This could furnish an efficient scenario to flatten the power-law. Nevertheless, we point out again that our main results confirm that the social isolation of individuals is by far the best efficient strategy to flatten the curves. "
133340,"Public health measures were decisive in controlling the SARS epidemic in 2003. Isolation is the separation of ill persons from non-infected persons. Quarantine is movement restriction, often with fever surveillance, of contacts when it is not evident whether they have been infected but are not yet symptomatic or have not been infected. Community containment includes measures that range from increasing social distancing to community-wide quarantine. Whether these measures will be sufficient to control 2019-nCoV depends on addressing some unanswered questions."
134932,"This is the first survey that specifically focused on the psychological dynamics of smoking behavior during Italian COVID-19 social distancing and stay-at-home policies. A large number of smokers, never smokers, former smokers, vapers and dual users participated; This study focused on a careful observation of the types of tobacco-related products (cigarette, e-cigarette, heated tobacco and dual usage) inserted within the italian lockdown period. Within this time frame, it could be of interest to observe such behaviour under a ""psychological lens"" that explains how and how much cigarette dependence or attachment to a low-risk product has affected the study participants' behaviour (Baltes et al., 2009 ). The first data to be observed is that of the declared slight decrease in the Article Table 2 . Changes in consumption. The COVID-19 era will be looked back into history as an era characterized by great upheaval that has upset every human rhythm and has not been experienced as a dive into the unknown, a feeling that was replicated day after day. It can and should be considered a ""transition"" phase and as such requires a search for a new balance. What is certainly most encouraging from reading the research data is that those who have quit smoking before COVID-19 have not relapsed thanks to their personal resilience and coping skills. The former smokers interviewed found their comfort zone in the home during this period, far from confrontation with others, thus not allowing the onset of psychological suffering related to the lack of cigarettes. These changes in everyday habits can be a significant moment to use established and emerging strategies to create a definitive smoke-free world. "
135763,"To the extent that interventions based on contact tracing can be implemented, they can help mitigate the spread of COVID-19. Our results suggest that individual quarantine could contain an outbreak of COVID-19 with a short serial interval (4·8 days), but only in settings with high intervention performance where at least 75% of infected contacts are individually quarantined. However, in settings where this performance is unrealistically high and the outbreak of COVID-19 continues to grow, so too will the burden of the number of contacts traced for active monitoring or quarantine. If the virus becomes widespread before any case-based control measures can be implemented and resources are prioritised for scalable interventions such as physical distancing, 20 we show active monitoring or individual quarantine of high-risk contacts can contribute synergistically with physical distancing. Effective reproductive number "
135916,"During the last 1-2 months, several studies have been published dealing with the impact of the lockdown on air quality at several cities in developed and developing countries around the world. Nearly all these studies revealed large declining trends in PM concentrations and in a series of air J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f pollutants, with these trends being strongly related to the specific characteristics of each site, the relative influence from traffic and industrial sources, the impact of natural emissions (forest fires, desert dust) and the proximity to major power plants that are under continuous operation. This section discusses results from recent studies dealing with the decreasing trends in aerosols and air pollutants due to COVID-19 lockdown at several places around the world. According to the Ministry of Ecology and Environment of China, (Report, 2020), the concentrations of six major air pollutants during the COVID-19 period (January -March 2020), have been drastically reduced compared to previous year(s), recording a mean reduction of -20% for PM 10 , -15% for PM 2.5 , -25% for NO 2 , -6% for CO, and -21% for SO 2 , while O 3 remained rather steady from year-to-year (Wang and Su, 2020) . Especially in Wuhan, where the general lockdown first established on 23 January 2020, the NO 2 levels have reduced by about 50% compared to the previous year (Wang and Su, 2020) . Another study , reported an average reduction of 52% in NO x emissions in east China during the period after the lockdown compared to the levels before. Average decreases of 24.7%, 13.7%, 6.8%, 5.9%, and 4.6%, for NO 2 , PM 10 , SO 2 , PM 2.5 and CO, respectively were reported in 44 cities in northern China (Bao and Zhang, 2020) , while significant reductions in air pollutants due to lockdown were also observed at the Yangtze River Delta, also captured by the WRF-CAMx model . However, nowadays, the NO x levels have been gradually regained in some Chinese provinces after the termination of the quarantine period and return-to-work day . Continuous monitoring of the pollution levels and future studies will reveal the degree of the pollution re-appearance over major urban areas in Malaysia as well, after the re-opening on the economy. In India, PM 10 , PM 2.5 , NO 2 and CO concentrations analyzed during 16 March -14 April from 2017 to 2020 in 22 cities over the country revealed reductions by 43%, 31%, 18% and 10%, respectively during the lockdown period compared to previous years. On contrary, SO 2 exhibited marginal changes, whereas an increase of 17% was seen for O 3 . Other studies in Delhi, revealed maximum reductions for PM 10 and PM 2.5 concentrations (50%) compared to the pre-J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 15 lockdown period (Mahato et al., 2020) , while compared to 2019, PM 10 and PM 2.5 decreased by about 60% and 35-39%, respectively (Chauhan and Singh, 2020; Mahato et al., 2020) . In addition, NO 2 decreased by 52.7% and CO by 30.4% during the lockdown period (Mahato et al., 2020) . Large reductions in CO (37.0% -64.8%) and NO 2 (24.1% -54.3%) levels were also observed in megacities in south America, like Rio de Janeiro (Dantas et al., 2020) and Sao Paolo (Nakada and Urban, 2020) , during the lockdown phase compared to the period before or previous years. In Almaty, Kazakhstan, CO and NO 2 levels reduced by 49% and 35%, respectively during the lockdown compared to the 2018-2019 averages of the same period, while PM 2.5 reduced by 21% (Kerimray et al., 2020) . The large atmospheric impact of COVID-19 in Barcelona, Spain was detected with a reduction of -45.4% in the BC concentrations and of -47.0% and -51.4% of the NO 2 levels at urban-background and traffic sites, respectively (Tobias et al., 2020) . Lower reductions in the PM 10 concentrations were recorded, in the range of 27.8% and 31.0% at urban-background and traffic sites, respectively, since PM 10 is related to several other sources like regional recirculation, dust resuspension or longrange transport, secondary aerosol formation, constructions, biogenic and marine emissions. This is in agreement with the lower (%) reductions in PM 10 and PM 2.5 concentrations in Malaysia compared to those of NO 2 . The daily O 3 levels in Barcelona increased by 29% to 58% at the urbanbackground and traffic sites (Tobias et al., 2020) , while at the urban sites in Malaysia, the average increase was much lower (7.3%). The increase in O 3 is mostly attributed to the large decrease in NO x levels within a VOCs limited urban environment, and to reduction in primary NO emissions that lower down the O 3 consumption via titration (Kerimray et al., 2020; Tobias et al., 2020) . However, changes in O 3 may be also related to changes in insolation that facilitates its production. In Milan, Italy, which has been severely affected by SARS-CoV2 (Conticini et al., 2020) , lockdown determined a period with a significant reduction in PM 10 , PM 2.5 , NO x , CO, black carbon and benzene levels, while SO 2 remained rather unchanged and O 3 increased due to lower NO concentrations (Collivignarelli et al., 2020) . In this study, the impact of the lockdown due to COVID-19 on the spatio-temporal variation of main atmospheric pollutants over SEA, and particularly in Malaysia, was investigated. 39% in the industrial and by 26-31% in the urban areas) and PM 2.5 (20-42% at industrial and 23-32% at urban sites) compared to previous years. A larger decrease occurred in NO 2 levels, which reduced by 33-46% in the industrial sites and by 64% in the urban centres. Lower reductions were observed for SO 2 and CO, while O 3 did not record significant changes over the years. The results of this study are indicative of the degree that the restriction measures and the regional lockdown due to COVID-19 affected the air pollution over a region with high levels of aerosols and pollutants from non-traffic and non-industrial activities. Therefore, aiming to evaluate the COVID-19 impact on air quality over the SEA region is a real challenge, especially during the pre-monsoon (March-April) period with extensive forest, vegetation and peat fires. Moreover, the role of meteorology has neither been evaluated nor quantified in this study and more detailed analysis is needed in the future. The beneficial for air quality restriction measures due to COVID-19 seem to be a unique opportunity for pollution-control policies and mitigating strategies against climate change over the SEA countries, although this is a very difficult and challenging task.  "
136226,"The German debate about the policy implications of the coronavirus becomes increasingly heated given different views on the mortality rate from SARS CoV-2, as well as the epidemiological and economic impact of lockdown measures imposed by the government. Impact analysis applying features of randomised control trials would provide clear evidence. However, this is currently unavailable due to a lack of an appropriate control group of countries without measures. Thus, polarisation is likely to rise if observed mortality rates remain low."
136556,"In this paper we have analysed, in the context of the standard SIR model for epidemic dynamics, the impact of different containment measures on size (the epidemic peak I P , the average number of infected ˆ I P and the total number of infected I E ), the timescale (the occurrence time of the peak t P and the whole time-span t E ) and the speed (time variation of the reproduction number | V P |) of epidemics. Using an exact solution for the epidemic dynamics we have been able to derive the scaling behaviour of these quantities under change of the two parameters (the infection rate α and the removal rate β) of the SIR model, which can be controlled by the containment measures. This allowed us to compare the impact on size, timescale and speed of the epidemic of containment measures acting either on α or on β. The main result of our paper is that for a given reduction of I P , ˆ I P , I E , the timescale and the speed of the epidemic are to a great extend sensitive to the kind of measures we put into play. By increasing the removal rate β instead of reducing the infection rate by a factor λ one can reduce the timescale of the epidemic by a factor 1/ λ and increase the speed of the epidemics by a factor λ. Hence, flattening of epidemic curves I ( t ) achieved by reducing α or increasing β are not equivalent. Flattening the curve by acting on β instead on α allows to keep under control also the width of the curve. This means that containment measures based on increasing β, e.g. based on tracing and removal of infectives, have a different effect than those that reduce α, e.g based on social distanc- 1 Notice that without containment measures at the end of the epidemic almost all individuals have been infected. ing or lockdown. This his particularly true for what concerns the timescale of the epidemic. If by increasing β we manage to bring ρ below the threshold we simply stop the epidemic, but even if we do not go so far, we can still reduce the size of an epidemic keeping under control its timescale. This is surely an advantage when the sanitary system can deal with the epidemic because in this way containment measures do not have to be implemented for a long time span. The situation is of course different if and when the sanitary system is overwhelmed by the epidemic, as it happened in the first phase of the COVID-19 diffusion in many countries or regions, also as a result of its unexpectedly fast spreading. An important point we have not addressed in this paper is the determination of the exact way in which the usual containment measures used to fight epidemic, impact on the values of the parameters α and β. Whereas it is quite clear that social distancing reduces the parameter α and does not change β, the effect of other measures like, early detection and contacts tracing is not a priori evident. Early detection and contact tracing increase β only if implemented on a large scale and followed by prompt and strict isolation of the detected infectives. If this is not the case, it is likely that these measures just bring a small reduction of α The recent analysis of Gaeta [10] of the different strategies used in Northern Italy to tackle the COVID-19 epidemic seems to confirm this result. He found that simple early detection and contact tracing, while having an impact on the epidemic peak, do not substantially affect the timescale of the epidemic. On the other hand he also showed that contact tracing if followed by prompt isolation is the only efficient way to reduce the size of the epidemic, without having to live with it a long time. The Veneto experience shows that this was one of the factors underlying the success of the containment strategy in that region. Thus the main lesson one can draw from our results is that, epidemic containment measures focused on tracing, early detection followed by prompt removal of infected individuals are more efficient to fight epidemics than those based on social distancing. Let us conclude this paper with some comments about the range of validity of our results. The SIR model is an oversimplified model for epidemic dynamics. Generalisations of it are necessary in order to give a good descriptions of real epidemics. For instance, in the case of the COVID-19 epidemic a generalization of the SIR model seems to be necessary in order to take into account the presence of a large set of a asymptomatic infective [9] [10] [11] . On the other hand, the SIR model gives the bare bones of deterministic epidemic dynamics. For this reason we believe that, at least at qualitative level, the main result of this paper -the possibility to reduce the epidemic peak keeping under control its timescale by acting on removal rates-could remain true for generalized and improved SIR-like models. "
136602,"BACKGROUND: There has been much debate about the effectiveness of lockdown measures in containing COVID-19, and their appropriateness given the economic and social cost they entail. To the best of our knowledge, no existing contribution to the literature has attempted to gauge the effectiveness of lockdown measures over time in a longitudinal cross-country perspective. OBJECTIVES: This paper aims to fill the gap in the literature by assessing, at an international level, the effect of lockdown measures (or the lack of such measures) on the numbers of new infections. Given this policy’s expected change in effectiveness over time, we also measure the effect of having a lockdown implemented over a given number of days (from 7 to 20 days). METHODS: We pursue our objectives by means of a quantitative panel analysis, building a longitudinal dataset with observations from countries all over the world, and estimating the impact of lockdown via feasible generalized least squares fixed effect, random effects, generalized estimating equation, and hierarchical linear models. RESULTS: Our results show that lockdown is effective in reducing the number of new cases in the countries that implement it, compared with those countries that do not. This is especially true around 10 days after the implementation of the policy. Its efficacy continues to grow up to 20 days after implementation. CONCLUSION: Results suggest that lockdown is effective in reducing the R0, i.e. the number of people infected by each infected person, and that, unlike what has been suggested in previous analyses, its efficacy continues to hold 20 days after the introduction of the policy.

137027,"Urban air pollution levels are mainly influenced by local emissions and chemical mechanisms (Kent et al., 2007; Huszar et al., 2015; Monks et al., 2015) . For instance, the local J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f photochemical formation accounted for 75% of the daytime O 3 in Wuhan in summer 2016 (Zeng et al., 2018) . In this study, we considered that 3-year baseline conditions were long enough to reduce inter-annual variability in air pollution levels, here more influenced by local short-term emissions reduction rather than meteorological variations. By investigating the lockdown effects on air quality in cities, we have a better understanding of contributions from sectoral emissions to air pollution, in particular the O 3 production, in order to formulate effective emission control policies. Among the dominant sectors contributing to air pollution in urban areas, the sectors ""transport"", ""industrial processes"" and ""commercial, institutional and households"" were strongly impacted by the lockdown measures in China, France, Italy and Spain. In Europe, the ""transport"" sector is the largest contributor to NO x emissions (road transport: 39%, non-road transport: 8%) and represents 13% of PM 2.5 and PM 10 emissions (EEA, 2019). The fuel and biomass combustion in the ""commercial, institutional and households"" (domestic heating) sector is the largest contributor to PM 2.5 and PM 10 emissions (56% and 39%, respectively) and represents 14% of NO x emissions, while 46% of non-methane VOCs and 8% of NO x are emitted by ""industrial processes"" sector. In Wuhan, the main source of air pollution recently shifted from coal combustion to a mixture of coal combustion and road traffic emissions where the combustion of fossil fuel and road traffic are the largest contributors to PM 2.5 and NO 2 emissions, respectively . The lockdown measures led to a decrease of NO (~63%) and NO 2 (~53%) concentrations in Nice, Rome, Valencia and Wuhan, while NO and NO 2 slightly declined by 53% and 30% in the highly industrialized city of Turin. The lower reduction in Turin can be explained by a higher contribution of the ""industrial"" sector, where essential industrial activities (e.g. food, pharmaceutical) continued during the lockdown. Stronger reductions were observed at traffic stations for NO (~78%) and NO 2 (~65%), where the ""road transport"" sector is the largest contributor to NO x emissions. The magnitude of changes in NO 2 levels was similar between European cities (~52%) and Wuhan in China (57%), where automobile exhausts are the major source of NO x . As road and non-road transport were drastically reduced, the lockdown effect on NO x reduction was much higher than the weekend effect, with NO x concentrations during the lockdown on average 49% lower than on weekends at all stations, and 60% lower at traffic stations. In Southern Europe, the lockdown measures did not significantly impact the PM 2.5 and PM 10 levels at all stations. Indeed, PM 2.5 and PM 10 concentrations decreased in Nice (3% and 6%) and Turin (13% and 9%) and increased in Rome (11% and 2%). Stronger reductions were observed in Valencia (13% and 32%). At traffic stations, the lockdown measures strongly decreased both PM 2.5 and PM 10 levels in Nice (8%), Rome (1-3%) and Valencia (29-51%). The observed decreases were due to the reduction of road and non-road transport, representing up to 15% of wintertime PM levels (Karamchandani et al., 2017) , and the reduction of fuel combustion in closed institutional and commercial buildings. However, this decrease was counter-balanced by a PM increase from domestic heating (""requiring people to stay at home"") and garden activities (e.g. biomass burning). In Nice, and surrounding cities, the local authorities issued a regulation to drastically reduce the green waste burning. By comparing both the lockdown and weekend effects on PM levels at all stations, we showed that the lockdown had the same effect as weekends in Nice, Rome and Turin (~6% of difference). Such slight difference suggests that road traffic was not a large contributor to PM emissions but derived more from residential and tertiary sector in these cities. The citizens behave similarly during lockdown and weekends. The strong reductions in particles at traffic stations observed in Valencia during the lockdown resulted from a combination of factors: i) a higher baseline due to landscaping works in one of the traffic stations in previous years and ii) several rainy days (wash-out effect) during the lockdown period. A higher contribution of ""transport"" (road transport: 18%; non-road transport: 21%) to PM emissions, as reported in Barcelona (Karamchandani et al., 2017) , could also partly explain the largest reduction observed in Valencia. In Wuhan, the PM 2.5 and PM 10 decreases by 36% and 49% were higher than those observed in Southern Europe (~4% and ~11%, respectively). In Wuhan, the emissions from household heating and cooking activities (ab. 32%), coal consumption and heavy industries harboring iron and steel smelts (accounted for 34% of secondary PM and 57% of primary dust) were the largest contributors to PM 2.5 and PM 10 emissions compared with ab. 5% from the ""transport"" sector (Qian et al. 2007; Wang et al., 2017) . The lockdown had a higher effect than the weekends on PM reduction in Wuhan (~44% less), thus, the strong reduction can be attributed to the reduction of coal combustion in the tertiary sector and cessation of industrial activities. During the lockdown 2020, the surface O 3 levels increased by 24-27% in Nice and Turin, by 14% in Rome and by 36% in Wuhan. The slight increase of O 3 levels in Valencia (2.4%) was mainly due to rainy and cloudy conditions (AEMET, 2020). In a recent paper, Tobías et al. (2020) reported an increase in O 3 of 29% at urban stations of Barcelona between February 16 th to March 13 th and March 14 th to 30 th , 2020. At city-scale, the O 3 formation depends on the VOC-NOx ratio (Pusede and Cohen, 2012) . The urban areas are characterized by a low ratio due to high NO x concentrations (Beekman and Vautard, 2010) . The local O 3 formation is generally limited by VOCs in Wuhan (Zeng et al., 2018) and in Southern Europe Sicard et al., 2020) . In this case, i.e. with ""VOC-limited"" conditions, a reduction in VOCs emission reduces the O 3 formation, but a reduction in NO x emission increases the O 3 formation. To effectively control O 3 pollution in Wuhan, the reduction ratio of VOCs to NO x concentrations should not be lower than 0.73 (Zeng et al., 2018) . The implementation of stringent lockdown measures produced more reduced NO x emissions than VOCs emissions in the investigated cities, leading to higher VOC-NO x ratio, which enhanced the O 3 production. During the lockdown, an increase in O 3 precursors emissions such as carbon monoxide (CO) and VOCs from home (e.g. cleaning, fireplaces) and garden activities (e.g. barbeques, biomass burning) may also have contributed to the O 3 increase (Coe et al., 2003; Murphy et al., 2007; Su et al., 2013; Wolff et al., 2013) . In cities, the freshly emitted NO, in particular from road traffic, depletes O 3 locally (Solberg et al., 2005; Molina et al., 2009 ). The O 3 titration occurs particularly in winter (less photolysis reactions of NO 2 ) under high NO x levels (Sillman, 1999) . Following the lockdown measures, the clear upward trend observed at all stations, resulted primarily from a lower titration of O 3 J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f by NO due to the reduction in local NO x emissions by road transport (e.g. Huszar et al., 2015; Sicard et al., 2016a) . In different European cities, the relative contribution of road traffic emissions to O 3 levels was 12-35% and 20-24% in three Mediterranean cities: Lisbon, Barcelona and Athens (Valverde et al., 2016; Karamchandani et al., 2017; Mertens et al., 2019) . In Wuhan, the vehicle exhausts made the largest contribution to O 3 production, with 30% during non-high O 3 days (Zeng et al., 2018) . These findings are in agreement with the rate of O 3 increase observed due to the lockdown measures. Furthermore, a reduction in PM 2.5 and PM 10 could also lead to an increase in surface O 3 concentrations (Liu et al., 2013; Li et al., 2017) . As PM emissions were lower during the lockdown, the higher solar radiation favored O 3 formation (Heuss et al., 2003; Murphy et al., 2007; Wolff et al., 2013) . In addition to photochemical reactions, the heterogeneous chemical processes occurring on the surface of PM 2.5 and aerosols in the atmosphere are also an important way for the interaction between O 3 and PM 2.5 (Meng et al., 1997; Jacob, 2000; Deng et al., 2010; Li et al., 2011) . In Nanjing, high concentrations of PM 2.5 (rising from 100 to 250 μg.m -3 ) resulted in a reduction of 130 W.m -2 of the irradiance and a 12% reduction of near-surface O 3 . In urban stations in France, Italy and Spain, the mean O 3 concentration on the weekend was 12% higher than on weekdays over the time period 2005-2014 (Sicard et al., 2020) . The O 3 weekend effect is more pronounced in winter (Sicard et al., 2020) . In this study, we showed that the mean O 3 concentrations during the lockdown were on average 10% and 38% higher than on weekend in Southern Europe and Wuhan, respectively. Generally, the lockdown effect on O 3 production was higher than O 3 weekend effect, mainly due to the longer period of NO x reduction. Furthermore, the average lifetime of O 3 in the troposphere is estimated at 20-24 days (Stevenson et al. 2006) . Following the implementation of stringent lockdown measures in the framework of the COVID-19 pandemic, the reduction in road and non-road transport, non-essential businesses and industrial activities led to significant declines in NO x and PM concentrations, especially in Wuhan. The lockdown measures led to a reduction of NO x concentrations of ~56% due to the large reduction of the ""transport"" sector (e.g. 70% in France). During the lockdown, the PM levels slightly changed (< 10% of change). Indeed, the restrictive measures reduced emissions of PM 2.5 and PM 10 by road and non-road transport and by fuel combustion in institutional and commercial buildings, but these decreases were counter-balanced by an increase of PM emissions from the activities at home (e.g. domestic heating, biomass burning). Due to stringent lockdown measures, generally the near-surface O 3 increased by ~17% in Southern European cities and by 36% in Wuhan, i.e. similarly to the relative contribution of road traffic emissions to O 3 levels. The O 3 increase is due to a lower titration of O 3 by NO due to the strong reduction in local NO x emissions by road transport. Overall, the largest effect of the lockdown measures on concentrations of NO x , PM and O 3 came from the large reduction in road transport, as observed at traffic stations. The NO x reduction during J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f the lockdown was higher than the VOCs reduction. Similarly to the O 3 weekend effect, the main causes of the higher O 3 concentrations in cities during the lockdown, under VOClimited conditions, are: i) a reduction in NO x emissions from road traffic leading to a lower O 3 titration by NO (dominant cause); ii) as PM emissions were lower, the higher solar radiation favored O 3 formation; and iii) an increase of O 3 precursors emissions from home and garden activities. In Southern Europe and Wuhan, NO x concentrations during the lockdown were on average 49% lower than on weekends. The lockdown effect on O 3 production was 10% higher than the O 3 weekend effect in Southern Europe and 38% higher in Wuhan. The lockdown did not lead to lower PM pollution than a « routine » weekend effect in Southern Europe (~6% of change). The unprecedented reduction in mobility and economic activity caused by the COVID-19 lockdown represents an exceptional opportunity for studying the contribution of different sources of primary pollutant and for understanding the changes in the atmospheric chemistry under conditions of reduced primary pollutant emissions in the cities. For secondary pollutants like O 3 , the lockdown has also shown that its reduction will remain challenging even with effective policies for reducing primary pollutants. (2012), as well as the World Health Organization Air Quality Guidelines (2006) for the human health protection in urban areas.  "
138692,"The Italian COVID-19 epidemic may finally be slowing, although the virus has spread from the North in Lombardy throughout the rest of the country. While there have been more than 233,000 confirmed cases, and a mortality rate estimated around 14%, Italy will now navigate an exit from lockdown with continued testing, monitoring, and contact tracing of any new infections. This article is protected by copyright. "
138697,We investigate the effects of social distancing in controlling the impact of the COVID-19 epidemic using a simple susceptible-infected-removed epidemic model. We show that an alternative or complementary approach based on targeted isolation of the vulnerable sub-population may provide a more efficient and robust strategy at a lower economic and social cost within a shorter timeframe resulting in a collectively immune population.
139170,"This is the first study to highlight the impact of lockdown on infection and death rates over a period of 4 weeks. There was an exponential decrease in both infections as well as death with lockdown. The declaration of lockdown early on in the pandemic proved to be a more effective measure. However, Sweden and South Korea performed equally well despite not implementing stringent lockdowns. Public health response in these two countries needs to be studied in detail to understand these observations. "
139369,"In March/April 2020 the Italian government drastically reduced vehicle traffic and interrupted all non-essential industrial activities over the entire national territory. Italy thus became the first country in the world, with the exception of Hubei, to enact lockdown measures as a consequence of the COVID-19 outbreak and the need to contain it. Italy is also a seismically active area, and as such is monitored by a dense permanent network of seismic stations. We analyse continuous seismic data from many stations in northern and central Italy, and quantify the impact of the lockdown on seismic ambient noise, as a function of time and location. We find that the lockdown reduces ambient noise significantly in the 1–10 Hz frequency range; because natural sources of seismic noise are not affected by the lockdown, the seismic signature of anthropic noise can be characterised with unprecedented clarity, by simply comparing the signal recorded before and after the lockdown. Our results correlate well with independent evaluations of the impact of the lockdown (e.g., cell phone displacements), and we submit that ambient-noise seismology is a useful tool to monitor containment measures such as the coronavirus lockdowns."
140101,"COVID-19's daily increasing cases and deaths have led to worldwide lockdown, quarantine and some restrictions. This study aims to analyze the effect of lockdown days on the spread of coronavirus in countries. COVID-19 cases and lockdown days data were collected for 49 countries that implemented the lockdown between certain dates (without interruption). The correlation tests were used for data analysis based on unconstrained (normal) and constrained (Tukey-lambda). The lockdown days was significantly correlated with COVID-19 pandemic based on unconstrained (r = −0.9126, F-ratio = 6.1654; t-ratio = 2.40; prob > .0203 with 49 observations) and based on Tukey-lambda (r = 0.7402, λ = 0.14). The lockdown, one of the social isolation restrictions, has been observed to prevent the COVID-19 pandemic, and showed that the spread of the virus can be significantly reduced by this preventive restriction in this study. This study offers initial evidence that the COVID-19 pandemic can be suppressed by a lockdown. The application of lockdown by governments is also thought to be effective on psychology, environment and economy besides having impact on Covid-19."
140488,"Abstract Background On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization characterized the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak as a pandemic. The first cases in Italy were reported on January 30, 2020, and the outbreak quickly escalated. On March 19, 2020, deaths in Italy surpassed those in China. The Italian government implemented progressively restrictive measures leading to a nationwide lockdown on March 8, 2020. This study aimed to assess the impact of mitigation measures implemented in Italy on the spread of COVID-19. Methods Publicly available data were used to evaluate changes in the growth curve of the number of patients hospitalized in intensive care (IC) at three time intervals between February 19, 2020 and April 9, 2020, following the implementation of progressive measures: (1) containment and travel restrictions, (2) lockdown of the epicenter of the outbreak, (3) school closures and nationwide lockdown. The models that showed the highest reliability according to the Akaike Information Criterion and based on data from the three time intervals were projected to assess how the epidemic would have evolved if no other measure had been implemented. Results The most reliable models were (1) exponential, (2) quadratic and (3) cubic (R2 0.99, > 0.99 and > 0.99 respectively), indicating a progressive decrease in the growth of the curve. Conclusion This study suggests the measures were effective in flattening the epidemic curve and bought valuable time, allowing for the number of IC beds to be nearly doubled before the national health system reached maximum capacity."
140764,"The eruption of the novel coronavirus COVID-19 had left extensive and profound impacts worldwide. Although this disease appears to be well controlled in India till now, the recent dramatic increase in new cases and deaths outside of India, especially in Europe and the United States, indicates that the COVID-19 eruption may have tragic results globally The study of the COVID-19 outbreak pattern of China may help in controlling the disease in other countries. As per the pattern of China, it may be understood that the effect of this disease in India will be at peak during the third and fourth weeks of April 2020. It is essential to discuss that these predictions are made on the basis of a comprehensive study of China. The strategies to reduce/control COVID-19 cases include a national lockdown of 21 days, public transport control, specialized medical support for affected populations, and others. If these measures are strictly followed, then results may be different. Our estimate shows that the mortality rate in India is predicted to be around 2.39%. Globally, a 3.4% mortality rate is estimated by the WHO as of March 3, 2020. 9 This mortality rate may vary in different states of India. It is important to emphasize that the predicted mortality rate could be different from the actual mortality rate looking at the measures taken by the Government of India. This study has not taken into consideration several other socioeconomic factors that may affect the spreading of COVID-19. These factors may be education, economic  The COVID-19 pandemic may be controlled if sufficient measures are taken to control the disease. The prediction about the pattern of the outbreak in India may help policy-makers take a comprehensive and necessary action. The number of deaths may be controlled as compared to China because of the precautionary measures that have already been taken in the country. The further study of other factors like education, economic conditions, medical facilities, climatic conditions, religious beliefs, and so forth may strengthen the prediction and help in controlling the outbreak of COVID-19. Also, this study may further be extended for predicting the outbreak in other countries.  "
141548,• COVID-19 control measures taken by five Asian countries first hit by coronavirus; • China took extremely aggressive measures of lockdowns and closing business; • Singapore took proactive measures of border controls and extensive contact tracing; • Taiwan seized border control and strict home quarantine with the use of big data; • South Korea executed widespread testing and contact tracing; • Japan promoted measures of social distancing.
141830,"Abstract Amid the COVID-19 pandemic, a nationwide lockdown is imposed in India initially for three weeks from 24th March to 14th April 2020 and extended up to 3rd May 2020. Due to the forced restrictions, pollution level in cities across the country drastically slowed down just within few days which magnetize discussions regarding lockdown to be the effectual alternative measures to be implemented for controlling air pollution. The present article eventually worked on this direction to look upon the air quality scenario amidst the lockdown period scientifically with special reference to the megacity Delhi. With the aid of air quality data of seven pollutant parameters (PM10, PM2.5, SO2, NO2, CO, O3 and NH3) for 34 monitoring stations spread over the megacity we have employed National Air Quality Index (NAQI) to show the spatial pattern of air quality in pre and during-lockdown phases. The results demonstrated that during lockdown air quality is significantly improved. Among the selected pollutants, concentrations of PM10 and PM2.5 have witnessed maximum reduction (>50%) in compare to the pre-lockdown phase. In compare to the last year (i.e. 2019) during the said time period the reduction of PM10 and PM2.5 is as high as about 60% and 39% respectively. Among other pollutants, NO2 (−52.68%) and CO (−30.35%) level have also reduced during-lockdown phase. About 40% to 50% improvement in air quality is identified just after four days of commencing lockdown. About 54%, 49%, 43%, 37% and 31% reduction in NAQI have been observed in Central, Eastern, Southern, Western and Northern parts of the megacity. Overall, the study is thought to be a useful supplement to the regulatory bodies since it showed the pollution source control can attenuate the air quality. Temporary such source control in a suitable time interval may heal the environment."
143489,"Understanding the factors that shape variation in municipal public policy is a vibrant area of current research (Einstein and Kogan, 2016) . In this note, we described municipal COVID-19 responses and found that municipal population size and local COVID-19 case totals are strongly related to municipal policy aggressiveness. In general, however, Canadian municipalities have responded to the pandemic in remarkably consistent ways. We also found modest variation in policy responses by province and ideology. These differences reflect features of Canadian political geography that are not yet well understood, especially the role of regional clustering in local policy diffusion. We thus see an important role for COVID-19 research as part of a larger agenda on the determinants of Canadian municipal public policy. 4 Note that the city hall indicator has no credible interval around it because we set its value deterministically for the purposes of identification. For more on this, see the online Appendix. 5 Just with any scaling procedure, the latent variable has no inherent meaning. We treat it as policy aggressiveness because that interpretation is consistent with the results of the model. Again, as with any scaling model, unless we introduce other external measures, there is no way to definitively determine the true ""meaning"" of the latent variable. 6 NWT is not included in this plot because we did not receive any responses from Yellowknife, the only municipality in NWT above 9,000 population. 7 We used Monte Carlo integration to develop these estimates. For more on this approach, see the online Appendix. 8 See the online Appendix for detail on this follow-up research. 9 Ontario's estimated latent aggressiveness is reliably higher than Alberta, BC, Manitoba, New Brunswick, Newfoundland and Labrador, Nova Scotia and Quebec. In these cases, the posterior probability that Ontario's estimate is greater than the other province is greater than .95. 10 Given the highly skewed distribution of municipal population sizes, we use logged population size in the figure and analysis. 11 One review suggested that the results appeared to be nonlinear and/or driven by a few outliers. To our eyes, the seven high leverage points with log(pop) > 13.25 will be mostly offset by the six points below the line where 12.5 < log(pop) < 13.25. The posterior probability that the adjusted R 2 of a LOESS model is bigger than the adjusted R 2 for the linear model is 0.738 for all of the data, 0.984 for the data where log(pop) < 13.25 and 0.7 for the data where log(pop) < 12.5. The statistically reliable result for the subset where log(pop) < 13.25 goes away when we remove the offsetting over-predicted points 12.5 < log(pop) < 13.25. Thus, we argue that there is little evidence of true nonlinearity in this result. The linear model coefficient for the full data is 0.149 with posterior probability greater than zero of 0.995. The linear model coefficient for the log(pop) < 12.5 subset is 0.172 with posterior probability greater than zero of 0.991. This would suggest the linear finding is quite robust. 12 The relationships are statistically unreliable in both cases, b = { 0.029, 0.027} with 75.7 percent, 84.2 per cent of the posterior distribution of the coefficients above zero. 13 The relationship is statistically reliable: b = 0.03 with 1.0 per cent of the posterior distribution to the left of zero. 14 We controlled for province by residualizing the latent mean and conservative vote based on province. For more on this see the online Appendix. "
143529,"The results of the study bring out the following inferences: 1. Ultraviolet-C bin with internal reflective surfaces was tested for safety and efficacy. 4 log reduction in microorganisms tested were observed on UV-C exposure for three minutes, using one 15 W, 254 nm, UV-C lamp. 2. The device can be used for disinfection of used facemasks before disposal, thereby reducing the risk of waste collectors from being exposed to hazardous waste. Also the multipurpose disinfector can be used for disinfection of UV-C stable metallic objects. 3. The device could be replicated with local resources and minimum material movement. 4. The UV-C disinfection innovations during in India must be evaluated for safety and efficacy as per ICMR guidelines. SCTIMST, being a designated center for regulate and evaluate the UV-C-based COVID-19 solutions, accelerated the technology translation to commercialization. "
143726,"Abstract Two weeks after the world health organization described the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) outbreak as pandemic, the Indian government implemented lockdown of industrial activities and traffic flows across the entire nation between March 24 and May 31, 2020. In this paper, we estimated the improvements achieved in air quality during the lockdown period (March 24, 2020 and April 20, 2020) compared to the pre-lockdown (January 1, 2020 and March 23, 2020) by analyzing PM2.5, PM10, SO4, CO, NO2 and O3 data from nine different air quality monitoring stations distributed across four different zones of the industrialized Gujarat state of western Indian. The Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB)-Air Quality Index (AQI) illustrated better air qualities during the lockdown with higher improvements in the zones 2 (Ahmedabad and Gandhinagar) and 3 (Jamnagar and Rajkot), and moderate improvements in the zones 1 (Surat, Ankleshwar and Vadodra) and 4 (Bhuj and Palanpur). The concentrations of PM2.5, PM10, and NO2 were reduced by 38–78%, 32–80% and 30–84%, respectively. Functioning of the power plants possibly led to less reduction in CO (3–55%) and the declined emission of NO helped to improve O3 (16–48%) contents. We observed an overall improvement of 58% in AQI for the first four months of 2020 compared to the same interval of previous year. This positive outcome resulted from the lockdown restrictions might help to modify the existing environmental policies of the region."
143772,"To the extent that interventions based on contact tracing can be implemented, they can help mitigate the spread of COVID-19. Our results suggest that individual quarantine may contain an outbreak of COVID-19 with a short serial interval (4.8 days) only in settings with high intervention performance where at least three-quarters of infected contacts are individually quarantined. However, in settings where this performance is unrealistically high and the outbreak of COVID-19 continues to grow, so too will the burden of the number of contacts traced for active monitoring or quarantine. In such circumstances where resources are prioritized for scalable interventions such as social distancing, 16 we show active monitoring or individual quarantine of high-risk contacts can contribute synergistically with social distancing. There may be such synergy in the data released by the WHO mission to China in February 2020. 17 In Guangdong, WHO reports that the proportion of fever clinic testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 declined from 0.47% on 30 January to 0.02% on 16 February, during a period of intensive social distancing interventions. 17 If one assumes that these social distancing interventions reduced transmission of nearly all infections that could cause attendance at a fever clinic, one might expect a lower total number of attendees, with proportionate declines in all infectious fever causes that are affected by social distancing. If one assumes that most fever causes are affected by social distancing, the declining proportion of SARS-CoV-2 among fever cases may reflect the benefits of interventions aimed specifically at this infection, which is to say case-based interventions like active monitoring, individual quarantine, and isolation. The effectiveness of individual quarantine versus active monitoring, targeted by contact tracing, heavily depends on the assumptions regarding the serial interval, the amount of transmission that occurs prior to symptom onset, and the feasibility setting. Under our fitted disease natural history parameters for serial interval scenario 1, with a shorter mean serial interval and hence substantial presymptomatic infectiousness, individual quarantine was considerably more effective than active monitoring at reducing onward transmission by an infected contact. To offset this relative benefit of individual quarantine compared to active monitoring, perverse incentives to avoid quarantine would have to be correspondingly larger. Both scenarios were fit using an incubation period with mean = 5.2 days among 451 lab-confirmed cases from Wuhan; 12 other recent estimates of the incubation period of COVID-19 include a mean of 6.4 7 .

144218,"In this paper, we construct an extended SIR model with agents optimally choosing outdoor activities. We calibrate the model and match it to the data from the United States. The model predicts the epidemic in the United States very well. Without government intervention, our simulation shows that the epidemic peaks on 22 March, 2020 and ends on 29 August, 2022. By the end of the epidemic, more than 21 million people will be infected, and the death toll is close to 3.8 million. We further conduct counterfactual experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of different polices against the virus. We find that no single policy can effectively suppress the epidemic, and the most effective policy is a hybrid policy with lockdown and broadening testing. Lockdown policy alone is ineffective in controlling the epidemic as agents would have optimally stayed at home anyway if the infection risk is high even without a lockdown. Broadening testing solely will accelerate the return to normal life as there are fewer infected people hanging around. However, as people do not internalize the social costs of returning to normal life, the epidemic could get even worse. Increasing medical capacity without any other measures only has temporary effects on reducing the death toll. We also find that random testing is too inefficient unless a majority of population is infected."
144468,"We have established a simulation tool that can estimate the dynamics of the COVID-19 outbreak, both locally for individual provinces or states and globally for an entire country. Our simulations suggest that-despite the social, regional, demographical, geographical, and socio-economical heterogeneities in different regions-the outbreak of COVID-19 follows a universal model with a few relatively robust parameters. Specifically, our simulation integrates a . 11 COVID-19 outbreak dynamics in the United States predicted with the SEIR model. Exposed, infectious, and recovered fractions of the affected populations for each state predicted using data from the early stages of the outbreak and assuming no additional countermeasures. Solid lines represent the mean and shaded regions highlight the 95% confidence interval. Latent period A = 2.56 days, contact period B = 3.38 days, infectious period C = 17.82 days, and fraction of initial latent population = E 0 ∕I 0 = 43.75 global network model with a local epidemic SEIR model at each network node. It uses six epidemiologically meaningful parameters, the latent and infectious periods A and C to characterize COVID-19 itself, the contact period B to characterize the behavior of the population, the initial latent population = E 0 ∕I 0 to characterize undetected community spreading at the onset of the outbreak, the affected population = N * ∕N to characterize containment, and the travel coefficient to characterize spreading through passenger air travel. The precise timeline of COVID-19, its basic reproduction number, and the effect of different mitigation strategies remain incompletely understood. Here we combined data from the outbreak in China with data from the early stages of the outbreak in the United States to identify the latent, contact, and infectious periods and the basic reproduction number of COVID-19. To quantify the outbreak dynamics, we integrated a global network model with a local epidemic SEIR model and solved the resulting set of coupled nonlinear equations using a Newton-Raphson scheme. For the outbreak in China, in n = 30 provinces, we found a latent period of 2.6 days, a contact period of 1.5 days, and an infectious period of 17.8 days. For the early stages of the outbreak in the United States, in n = 50 states, we found a contact period of 3.4 days and a travel coefficient of 0.42. Our network model predicts that-without the massive political mitigation strategies that are in place today-the United States would have faced a basic reproduction number of 5.30 ± 0.95 and a nationwide peak of the outbreak on May 10, 2020 with 3 million infections. Our results suggest that mathematical modeling can help estimate outbreak dynamics and provide decision guidelines for successful outbreak control. Our model has the potential to quantify the impact of community measures and predict the effect of relaxing total lockdown, shelter in place, and travel restrictions for low-risk subgroups of the population or for the population as a whole. "
144589,"The many variations on a graphic illustrating the impact of non-pharmaceutical measures to mitigate pandemic influenza that have appeared in recent news reports about COVID-19 suggest a need to better explain the mechanism by which social distancing reduces the spread of infectious diseases. And some reports understate one benefit of reducing the frequency or proximity of interpersonal encounters, a reduction in the total number of infections. In hopes that understanding will increase compliance, we describe how social distancing a) reduces the peak incidence of infections, b) delays the occurrence of this peak, and c) reduces the total number of infections during epidemics. In view of the extraordinary efforts underway to identify existing medications that are active against SARS-CoV-2 and to develop new antiviral drugs, vaccines and antibody therapies, any of which may have community-level effects, we also describe how pharmaceutical interventions affect transmission."
145140,"As it could be expected, the lockdown, including restricted social contact, closing of restaurants, shops, and a large number of companies and administrative centers, temporarily reduced levels of specific air pollutants, mostly the primary dominated ones. The role of the meteorology is also evident and not quantified in this study. The most significant variation was observed for NO 2 . Urban NO 2 is emitted from combustion processes, mostly road traffic in urban areas, especially diesel and, to a lesser extent, gasoline, vehicles, industry, power generation, and shipping. Although the main source of PM10 in the urban background of Barcelona is road traffic (around 30 % of the annual mean) (Amato et al., 2016) , other important sources are industrial sources, harbor emissions, construction works, dust resuspension, and Saharan dust episodes. The latter occurred before and during the lockdown period, from February 28 th to March 1 st and March 18 th to 24 th , respectively, and this has influenced the variation of PM10. This might have reduced the decrease of PM10 when compared with that of NO 2 , but in addition, other causes could also contributed. Thus, a relevant proportion of PM10 has a regional background-origin, mostly of secondary PM, and regional air mass transport might have influenced PM10 to the point of reducing the effects of local emission abatement. Barcelona is a low SO 2 city, with most of this pollutant arising from shipping emissions. These are large cargo ships, ferries, and cruises. The low reduction observed might be due to the detection limit of the instruments, but also to the low SO 2 emissions from cruises, the type of ships most reduced in the lockdown period. Finally, levels of O 3 markedly increased into the city as a consequence of three possible combined causes. Firstly, the decrease of NOx in a VOCs-limited environment (as most urban areas of Europe are) might cause urban O 3 to increase, as opposed to the behavior at the ruralregional background, which is mainly NOx-limited (Monks et al., 2015) ; secondly, the decrease of nitrogen oxide (NO) reduces the O 3 consumption (titration, NO+O 3 =NO 2 +O 2 ), and causes an increase of O 3 concentrations; and thirdly, the usual increase of insolation and temperatures from February to April leads to an increase in O 3 , especially during Saharan dust episodes (from March 18 th to 24 th ), when the maximum O 3 was recorded. In any case, by staying at home, personal NO 2 exposure is expected to be reduced by 40% in comparison to outdoor exposure, as a study carried out for 39 schools in Barcelona evidenced J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f (Rivas et al., 2014) . Thus, in addition to the abatement of outdoor NO 2 levels, this exposure reduction should be taken into account. Unfortunately, the current lockdown was not able to stop the rising of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic. For this reason, more restrictive actions were implemented for a total lockdown, which entered into force on March 30 th (MPRCMD, 2020b). Finally, we would like to express that here we characterized the changes produced on air quality during the lockdown. We do not pretend to attribute specifically, neither quantifying the effects of the lockdown since other factors might have influenced the changes, such as meteorology and regional and long transport of pollutant. An in-deep analysis is required to obtain this information accurately. In conclusion, we expect that air quality will keep improving for PM10, PM2.5, BC, and NO 2 down to minimal levels during forthcoming weeks because of the more restrictive actions to reduce the population's mobility and shut down of a large number of industries. The air pollution effects of the lockdown will be a unique opportunity to evaluate the effects of the reduction of different emission sources and to assess further air quality policies. However, we should clearly state that air quality policy is a long-distance race and that the effects of past emergencies (e.g., the 2008 financial crisis) for further air quality and climate policies have always been adverse. J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f  "
145382,"This first modelling work in Europe provides a rigorous framework for studying the effects of containment on air quality by avoiding meteorological biases (comparison here over identical periods) and biases intrinsic to the model (when focussing on the analysis of differences). Our results given at a resolution of 20 km show decreases in NO 2 concentrations ranging from -30 % to -50 % in all western Europe countries. Ozone concentrations have been differently affected in urban areas throughout Western Europe by lockdown measures with increase of concentrations. The effect on fine particle concentrations has been less pronounced than on NO 2 (-5 to -15 %). This can be explained by the fact that traffic is not the sole source of fine particles. Particularly during this season, residential heating emissions, which are a very substantial contributor to PM concentrations in western Europe is supposed to increase by lockdown measures since European citizens have been instructed to stay at home as much as possible. Also, agricultural emissions due to fertilizer spreading is known to be a strong source of ammonium nitrate in western European countries in late winter and early springtime, they have not been affected by lockdown measures. These preliminary results are encouraging and in agreement with studies based on comparisons with satellite and station measurements. Further analyses will have to be carried out to better understand the weight of sectors in these modelled differences. A refinement of assumptions on emissions adjustment due to the lockdown measures will be necessary to improve results robustness. "
145399,"In this study, the variation of NO 2 which was collected from the satellite (Sentinel -5P) was used to indicate the significant reduction in the level of NO 2 in Asian and European countries due to COVID-19 lockdowns. The outcomes indicated that the novel coronavirus is considered a blessing in disguise. The current status of air quality may be temporary but there is a very good opportunity for us (scientists/researchers/students/individuals) to learn/understand from the applied lockdown activities on how to minimize the concentration level of air pollutants on a long-term basis. "
145838,"BACKGROUND: The COVID‐19 pandemic has led to radical political control of social behaviour. The purpose of this paper is to explore data trends from the pandemic regarding infection rates/policy impact and draw learning points for informing the unlocking process. METHODS: The daily published cases in England in each of 149 Upper Tier Local Authority (UTLA) areas were converted to Average Daily Infection Rate (ADIR), an R value—the number of further people infected by one infected person during their infectious phase with Rate of Change of Infection Rate (RCIR) also calculated. Stepwise regression was carried out to see what local factors could be linked to differences in local infection rates. FINDINGS: By the 19th April 2020 the infection R has fallen from 2.8 on 23rd March before the lockdown and has stabilised at about 0.8 sufficient for suppression. However, there remain significant variations between England regions. Regression analysis across UTLAs found that the only factor relating to reduction in ADIR was the historic number of confirmed number infection/000 population, There is, however, wide variation between Upper Tier Local Authorities (UTLA) areas. Extrapolation of these results showed that unreported community infection may be 150 times higher than reported cases, providing evidence that by the end of the 2nd week in April, 26.8% of the population may already have had the disease and so have increased immunity. INTERPRETATION: Analysis of current case data using infectious ratio has provided novel insight into the current national state and can be used to make better‐informed decisions about future management of restricted social behaviour and movement."
145995,"Blume et al. studied the effects of the COVID-19 lockdown on the mismatch between social and biological sleep-wake timing as well as sleep. Increased flexibility of social schedules reduced the mismatch while sleep quality was reduced, possibly due to increased burden. These adverse effects may be alleviated by daylight exposure and physical exercising."
146286,"Abstract Many communicable diseases may have contact, airborne, and/or droplets transmission. Following the COVID-19 outbreak, Taiwan government implemented the use of masks and sanitizer and other prevention measures, like social distancing for prevention. This public response may have likely contributed significantly to the decline in the outbreak of other infectious diseases."
146412,"I would like to thank Dr. Thomson for the very pertinent and relevant points that he raised in his thoughtful letter Where are we now with COVID-19? [1]. As my response will illustrate, and in what probably will become a defining feature of conversations surrounding COVID-19 for quite some time, attempts to answer will only make room for more questions. As COVID-19 is unfolding, every day is marked by novel developments. Since the editorial went to press [2], the outbreak has expanded considerably. Over 128,000 individuals were infected worldwide as of March 13, 2020, leading to 4720 deaths [3]. In early March, while the outbreak in China appeared to start to subside [4], it started to amplify in Europe and the United States. The first fatality in the United States occurred on February 29, 2020 in a suburb of Seattle. On March 4m the first death was reported outside WA state, in CA, and was the 11th death in the United States. On March 6, the first two fatalities were reported in Florida. On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak a pandemic [5]."
146677,"The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, which originated in the city of Wuhan, China, has quickly spread to various countries, with many cases having been reported worldwide. As of May 8th, 2020, in India, 56,342 positive cases have been reported. India, with a population of more than 1.34 billion—the second largest population in the world—will have difficulty in controlling the transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 among its population. Multiple strategies would be highly necessary to handle the current outbreak; these include computational modeling, statistical tools, and quantitative analyses to control the spread as well as the rapid development of a new treatment. The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare of India has raised awareness about the recent outbreak and has taken necessary actions to control the spread of COVID-19. The central and state governments are taking several measures and formulating several wartime protocols to achieve this goal. Moreover, the Indian government implemented a 55-days lockdown throughout the country that started on March 25th, 2020, to reduce the transmission of the virus. This outbreak is inextricably linked to the economy of the nation, as it has dramatically impeded industrial sectors because people worldwide are currently cautious about engaging in business in the affected regions."
146973,"The reinforcement learning algorithm is ready for use in conjunction with real-world data sets, epidemiological models and network propagation models. Any of these three aspects can be changed as per user requirements. The algorithm is computationally lightweight, and, running it only requires Python. We have demonstrated its capability of handling nation-scale data Khadilkar et al. (2020) . We are open to collaborating with epidemiologists who could benefit from a computational approach to address the spread of communicable diseases. S is susceptible, E is exposed (virus in the body but not yet affecting the immune system), IS is infected (showing symptoms), IA is asymptomatic carrier, D is dead, and R is recovered. Note the numbers represent capture probabilities and not rates of change. All parameters can be tuned. We do not consider a transition from Recovered to susceptible states, but this can be added if found to be possible  "
147141,"In this paper, we have used an agent-based model of out-of-equilibrium economic dynamics to estimate the cost of the COVID-19 lockdowns. We use the major simplifying assumption that lockdown mesures are implemented in an uniform manner and that there is no direct impact in countries that have not implemented an explicit lockdown (e.g. Korea and Sweden). Conditional on data availability, a country-specific modelling of lockdowns measures can be implemented. However, readily exploitable data from this perspective is likely to be available onlyà posteriori. At present our model is calibrated on the Word Input Output Tables (Timmer et al. 2015 ) and relies on estimates of the dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic and of the associated policy response that were published in early May 2020 (IFO-Institute 2020). Our model (neutral) , the scenario with a confidence shock at lag 50 without and with public subsidies (label subsid). For output, are also reported the output given direct impacts and the equilibrium level of output. All values are in million U.S dollars. The Chinese lockdown ends at day 43. In major high-income economies, the lockdown is assumed to end around day 100. Elasticity parameter is set to θ = 0.5. Speed parameters for price and technological adjustment, τ p and τ w , are set to 0.6 accounts both for direct impacts of the lockdowns and its propagation through the global supply chain. Our estimate of the total impact amounts to 9% of global GDP. This estimate is in line with the upper range of estimates published by international organisations (see Table 4 in the Appendix). These upper hand estimates, as opposed to the lower hand ones, are themselves obtained through models that account for indirect or supply chain effects (see e.g. Kohlscheen et al. (2020) ). Our estimates rely on the assumption, prevailing at the date of writing, that lockdown measures will be lifted after 50 days in average. The dynamics of the model suggest that the costs would increase linearly with the duration of the lockdown if it were to be extended. This assumption is also consistent with concurrent estimates reported in the Appendix, some of which are expressed in terms of cost per week/month of lockdown. Our simulations also show that the cost increases substantially if the recovery is hampered by a major confidence shock. We are still in the early days of the analysis of economic costs of lockdowns implemented by many governments in the wake of the pandemic. Nonetheless, what has become evident is that multiple models are needed to address different questions. Models which shed light on longterm consequences will have to be somewhat different from those which explain short and medium term dynamics, at least in part because economic agents are likely to adapt to new circumstances. These new circumstances include the policy risk faced by firms who source inputs from suppliers situated within geographical regions administered by governments different from their own. In similar vain, models intended to study the impact of monetary policy responses may have to explicitly consider indebtedness and liquidity constraints. Supply-chain dynamics however are likely to be an important ingredient of many models. In this paper, we have illustrated how one such supply-chain system can be calibrated to the world economy and how the calibrated system can be used to study disequilibrium dynamics that follow from an exogenous shock. Ours is however primarily an analysis of the short and medium run. One of the assumptions which limits our model's ability to say much about the long-run is the assumption that agents cannot change their input providers, though they can change the proportions in which they combine inputs. In the longer run, the COVID virus, its policy responses, and the risk of similar policy responses in the future is likely to generate a remarkable reorganization of the global supply chain. Firms may diversify among suppliers of inputs and source inputs from within national or regional areas. The model presented in this paper can be extended to study the longrun reorganization of the world supply chain network. In fact, such a version of the model is used by Gualdi and Mandel (2018) to study the emergence of endogenous growth when firms change input sellers in response to technological improvements. Our model can also be coupled with epidemiological models of the spread of the virus and labor market models wherein labor dynamics too percolate from one market to another.

147245,"In the span of a couple of months, COVID-19 has severely challenged the world. To prevent the virus spread, nations across the world went on lockdown fully knowing the economic drawback of such measures. Conscientious of its fragile economy, Benin's government settled on creating a sanitary cordon around the affected areas with free movement of the population within it while appealing for the public's responsibility, promoting handwashing and hygiene along with social distancing. Although the sanitary cordon measure is effective in preserving the economic costs on the household level and containing the spread of the virus, it is however expected that people will find ways to intrude in and out of the sanitary cordon which will eventually lead to COVID-19 spreading to other towns or cities.

148466,"This article presents raw inferential statistical data that determined the coronavirus readiness strategies at retail stores in South Africa and their consequences for consumer behavioural intentions. The data was collected from customers within the metropolitan area of Bloemfontein. The data were analysed using a quantitative approach. Structured questionnaires were provided to customers throughout South Africa's Bloemfontein metropolitan area. Reliability and validity were confirmed. The data was presented using Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) using the Smart PLS program. The analysis of the SEM path shows estimates of the interconnectivity of the major constructs in the data. The findings from this dataset show that sanitised retail entrances, sanitised retail counters and sanitised retail shelves had a statistically significant effect on customer satisfaction with covid-19 readiness in retail stores. Furthermore, the data reveals that retail social distancing and senior citizens shopping hours had a statistically insignificant effect on customer satisfaction with covid-19 readiness. Moreover, the data reveals that customer satisfaction with covid-19 readiness strategies of retail stores also had a positive and statistically significant effect on customer behavioural intentions."
148750,"Abstract Effective reproductive numbers (Rt) were calculated from data on the COVID-19 outbreak in China and linked to dates in 2020 when different interventions were enacted. From a maximum of 3.98 before the lockdown of Wuhan City, the values of Rt declined to below 1 by the second week of February, after construction of hospitals dedicated to COVID-19 patients. The Rt continued to decline following additional measures in line with the policy of “early detection, early report, early quarantine and early treatment”. The results provide quantitative evaluations of how intervention measures succeeded and their timings, from which lessons can be learnt by other countries and those dealing with future outbreaks."
149050,"Within the context of a pandemic such as COVID-19, individuals' reactions to the pandemic to avoid infection could be predicted by a variety of variables. This study aimed to ascertain the main determinants of social distancing adopted by Arab residents in Qatar to avoid infection with the pandemic disease COVID-19. Referring particularly to the association between personality traits and social distancing, the results showed that agreeableness was negatively associated with social distancing, which indicates that individuals who are more sociable and prefer to participate in social eventssuch as volunteering activities and social interactions-were less likely to practice social distancing to avoid infectious disease. Since altruism, empathy, and helping behavior are the main characteristics of agreeable individuals (Graziano et al. 2007) , they may prioritize social interactions and engage in social practices and feel less obligated to practice social distancing. O openness, C conscientiousness, E extraversion, A agreeableness, N neuroticism, RP risk perception, PHP personal hygiene practices, SD social distancing *p < .05; **p < .001 This behavior may increase their likelihood of being infected with COVID-19. Furthermore, conscientiousness and neuroticism were shown to be positively associated with adopting social distancing to avoid COVID-19 infection. This means that individuals who are more inclined to comply with social norms and those who develop anxious and fearful feelings tend to practice social distancing. In their study, Cowling et al. (2010) reported that high levels of anxiety were associated with lower rates of personal hygiene practices (handwashing) and higher levels of social distancing to avoid H1N1 contagion. Moreover, Trobst et al. (2002) found that individuals who score high on neuroticism tend to adopt risky sexual practices. The inconsistency in the behavior of people prone to neuroticism when dealing with a pandemic disease may be associated with their level of neuroticism. For example, individuals with high levels of fear and anxiety tend to adopt denial as a psychological defense mechanism to mitigate their fears; this means that they practice risky behaviors to feel psychologically secure (Aronson 2008; Florian and Mikulincer 1997; Peek et al. 2008) . In addition to the findings on personality traits, the results show that risk perception predicts social distancing. Hence, individuals who consider COVID-19 to be a serious danger are more inclined to adopt social distancing practices to avoid infection. These results corroborate those of previous studies (e.g., Brug et al. 2009; Ibuka et al. 2010; Walter et al. 2012) . Furthermore, when an individual perceives a health risk factor, they react to the risk by attempting to find ways to avoid it. These solutions represent avoidance behavior that is adopted to survive an infectious disease. Our results also show that women are more likely to practice social distancing than men; these results coincide with those of prior studies (e.g., Liao et al. 2010; Moran and Del Valle 2016; Park et al. 2010) . The participants who declared that they maintain good personal hygiene practices were shown to be more likely to adopt social distancing. This variable is the most powerful predictor of social distancing practices. Since keeping personal hygiene practices helps to reduce the risk of being infected (Aiello and Larson 2002) , it could be inferred that an individual's personal perception of being clean motivates them to reinforce such behavior by adopting further actions, such as social distancing. Moreover, Qatar is considered to be a multinational society (Mahgoub and Qawasmeh 2012) so that members of each group may perceive other groups as outgroups; therefore, individuals who adhere to good personal hygiene practices might perceive others as ""less clean"" or more contaminated, which, in turn, increases the probability of being infected (Speltini and Passini 2014) ; thus, they embrace more protective behavior, such as social distancing. The findings of this study provide a better understanding of individuals' responses to the pandemic based on personality traits and illustrate the importance of both risk perception and personal hygiene practices. During the pandemic, individuals' behavior could be predicted if we know information about their personality traits, so that health care providers can design appropriate interventions aimed at raising awareness among people in the community. Moreover, the present study assists in identifying the powerful role of personal hygiene practices that should be highlighted in national campaigns aimed at helping people in the community. Additionally, the association between risk perception and social distancing measures can be used to help reduce infection rates, which would help control the spread of the pandemic. Furthermore, based on the findings concerning gender differences in precautionary behaviors to avoid contagion (social distancing), our findings would be useful in encouraging media platforms to focus on presenting persuasive messages focused on men, as they are less likely to adopt protective behaviors. Our study has limitations. First, the respondents were residents of Qatar of different Arab nationalities; therefore, their precautionary behavior (social distancing) may be affected by the culture of their home country. Second, the sample may not be representative of all nationalities in Qatar, particularly individuals of non-Arab nationalities working in Qatar, such as Indians, Filipinos, and Pakistanis; therefore, caution should be used when generalizing the results. Third, the scale developed for this study to assess social distancing practices during COVID-19 in Qatar comprised three items that have acceptable reliability. However, it is necessary to develop and validate an extensive scale and re-examine the predictors of social distancing. Fourth, although self-reporting data can help in obtaining respondents' views and perspective, self-reported answers may be biased because of social desirability. The current study sheds light on factors that could predict the adoption of precautionary behaviors (social distancing) to avoid infection during the COVID-19 pandemic. The main predictors are personality traits, risk perception, and personal hygiene practices. We suggest further research on the role of the neuroticism personality trait in predicting social distancing behavior, as there have been inconsistent findings concerning how individuals who are high in neuroticism behave in response to the pandemic. Further research is also recommended to investigate the impact of personal hygiene practices on social distancing from an interpersonal contact perspective.

149349,"Ontario has been escalating a series of public health measures aimed at containing the COVID-19 outbreak. As of March 14th, Ontario closed all public schools until April 5th. On March 16th, the Ministry of Health requested closure of all recreational programs and libraries, all private schools, all daycares, all churches and other faith settings, all bars and restaurants, with the exception of those that can shift to a takeout/delivery mechanism. On March 17th, Ontario declared state of emergency and, after an initial transition, as of March 24th at midnight, closure of all non-essential workplaces becomes mandatory and effective. In the present study, using the COVID-19 incidence report data from February 26th to April 13, we estimated key epidemiological and intervention parameters of a disease transmission model in Ontario. We estimated the transmission risk and studied the impact of public health interventions implemented by Ontario, we also estimated the probability of individuals presenting symptoms, which is consistent with previously established estimates [16] . While the control reproduction number had been decreasing with time, our simulations based on data as of March 29 indicated that further compliance with measures and additional interventions were needed to reduce below the control threshold of 1. We pointed out that a combination of additional reduction of contacts and increasing the detection rate would help to reduce the effective reproduction number to under the unity for disease control, and our estimation and analysis based on time series of cumulative reported cases since March 24 confirmed this strategy worked: since the closure of nonessential business and increasing the detection rate since March 24, we noted rapid decline of the effective reproduction number and the fast approaching of the epidemic peaks. In particular, to identify the evolution of contact rates and other parameters potentially affected by the variation of intervention intensity, we have estimated the relevant parameters using cumulative reported cases by March 21st, March 25th, and by March 29th, respectively. As a result, the control reproduction numbers estimated using the different time intervals decreased from 3.25 to 2.97 and 2.84, indicating a gradually increasing effectiveness of the interventions adopted. Further, we illustrated how the control interventions adopted by the government and the public have begun to play an important role in mitigating the epidemic in Ontario since March 21st (Fig. 2) . Using the estimated parameters and based on the model, we predicted the number of cumulative confirmed cases as of April 7th to be 6132 (95% CI 4250-8000) (Fig. 3(A) ), and we noted that this could have been further reduced by ∼ 50% by decreasing the contact rates from March 30th to April 7th by 90% (Fig. 3(B) ). Hence the level of compliance with social distancing advisories by the public and the increasing capacity of case detection can influence the future trend of the epidemic. Comparing the estimates from the three different time intervals before the closure of non-essential business, we conclude that the intervention efforts and control measures, such as lockdown and social distancing advisories, was effective in reducing the personto-person contact rate (Table 1 ). We also estimated that proportionally more cases are being quarantined which had contributed to the decrease of the control reproduction number (Table 1) . However, the estimated transmission efficacy was not changed significantly since the adoption of controls (Table 1) until March 24, indicating that the intensity of personal protections against effective contacts was not improved. Although the control reproduction number by March 24 had decreased, it was still close to 3 and would be below 1 only if the effective contact rate (the contact rate times the transmission probability per contact) is reduced by 2/3. Therefore, there should be persistent control efforts in reducing contact rate and the duration of infection of infectious individuals, which is possible with a fast case detection rate and effective isolation measures. We confirmed that this was indeed achieved two weeks after the closure of non-essential business and the improved testing. We also considered the scenario that some of the efforts might have reached their maximum level by social distancing and self-isolation recommendations before the closure of non-essential business on March 24, so decreasing transmission efficacy by boosting personal protection could be a mitigation option. Using simulations, we illustrated the impact of reducing transmission efficacy on future cumulative number of confirmed cases, epidemic peak time, and peak number of infections as shown in Fig. 4(A) and Fig. 4(B) . We also simulated the role of increasing testing which leads to increase in the case confirmation rate and suggested the possibility of a combination of rapid testing and effective quarantine ( Fig. 4(D, E, F) ) in reducing the case number and reducing the control reproduction number. Overall, the contact rate, transmission probability, detection/diagnose rate, and quarantine rate are key factors that influence the control reproduction number (Fig. 4(C), Fig. 4 (F) and Fig. 4(I) ). While epidemic control in Ontario was achieved with reduction of contacts and increase of detection rate during the period from March 24 to April 13 as shown in Fig. 5 , our simulations show that there is still much room for improvement in personal protection. This is an encouraging news for Ontarians to plan for their social distancing de-escalation strategy, as increasing personal protection may compensate a certain degree of social distancing relaxation. Social distancing advisories, closures, among the package of implemented control measures have assisted in reducing disease transmission; however, personal protection may admit further reduction in forward transmission. Personal protection in the form of improved hygiene such as handwashing, reduction of face-touching, and the appropriate utilization of personal protective equipment (PPE) offers the convenience of being actionable by all individuals in the public and may mitigate future COVID-19 transmission in Ontario. Mask wearing and instant hand wiping has been proposed and supported to mitigate transmission of COVID-19, and recent findings indicate that surgical face masks could prevent transmission of human coronaviruses from symptomatic individuals [14, 17] . In this light, Ontarians should intensify its effort in acquiring protective supplies such as masks and protective clothing, and develop an optimal distribution strategy if supplies are in insufficient supply. Respiratory infectious diseases, such as COVID-19, are spread through a susceptible individual's contact with infectious agents. These contacts facilitate disease transmission and can be made indirectly through environmental routes or through direct person-toperson interaction. PPE, such as surgical and N95 masks, are utilized with the aim of reducing the likelihood of disease transmission either from an asymptomatic infection to susceptible contacts, or upon an individual's exposure to an infectious agent such as a cough or sneeze carrying a pathogenic load. However, as in the case of surgical and N95 masks, PPE may not be tested or efficacious for conditions which they may see in practice, including a range of plausible human respiratory emissions containing pathogenic loads [18, 19] . Further, no studies have directly evaluated the biophysics of droplets and gas formation for patients infected with the SARS-CoV-2 [18] . Lastly, in some regions, the availability of surgical masks may be limited in light of the high demand and recent production decreases [20] . All these points emphasize the urgent need for a mechanistic and comprehensive understanding of respiratory disease transmission, in order to effectively design PPE and enhance COVID-19 mitigation strategies such as social distancing. These points highlight several of the current challenges and difficulties of PPE adequately reducing disease transmission, warranting further research. In conclusion, through the parametrization and simulation of disease transmission models with intervention mechanisms informed with multiple data sources including regional demographics, and regional intervention features, our work utilizes a foundational framework for intervention evaluation and intervention scenario analysis. This study highlights the opportunity for evaluation of control measures and trend in disease transmission to inform the future decision-making for preparedness, real-time management as well as risk assessment of COVID-19.

149433,We report early findings from COVID-19 cases in Brunei suggesting a remarkably high proportion of asymptomatic (12%) and presymptomatic (30%) cases. This proportion was even higher in imported cases. These have implications for measures to prevent onward local transmission and should prompt reconsideration of current testing protocols and safe de-escalation of social distancing measures.
150094,"Three quarantine models are developed for three different stages of COVID-19. Reproduction number for all the three stages is obtained and the condition for local and global asymptotic stability is well established. When the reproduction number is greater than one, the systems developed in all the three stages of infection-endemic equilibrium in S-I phase plane is 55 globally asymptotic stable. The two vital pivot parameters of all the three models of COVID-19, home isolation and hospital quarantine is well analysed. From the numerical simulations it is very clear that the more we have home isolation (or complete lockdown or social distancing), the less we have the chances to be infected and the disease to be transmitted in the population, which is very evident from Figures 7(c), 8(c) , 9(c),10(c),11(c), 12(c). The general home isolation for our results is approximately 11.85 days. From the simulation results it is also evident from Figures 8(b) (i), 9(b), 10(b)(i)&(ii), 11(b), 12(b)(i) &(ii) that COVID-19 positive population when are subjected to hospital quarantine, the transmission of the disease is reduced and the rate of recovery also increases. Till date when no vaccine or treatment is available for COVID-19, then from our developed models, it is well established that social distancing and hospital quarantine (for positive cases) is the only best treatment.

150421,"In this paper, we propose a SAIR model on social networks to model the spread of COVID-19 and analyse the outbreak based on the epidemic data of Wuhan from January 24 to March 2. By calculating the basic reproduction number and carrying out Monte Carlo simulations, we can obtain that to curb the spread of the pandemic, the measures proposed by us are in fair agree-ment with the measures the government had taken. In particular, we divide the outbreak of COVID-19 in Wuhan into three stages to explain why the infected cases increased though the government had taken efficient measures in the early stage. Furthermore, we find that with the average degree of network ascending, the pandemic would spread more rapidly and the duration time becomes longer. Therefore, another feasible method to curb the spread of the pandemic is to reduce the density of social networks, such as limiting the mobility and in-person social contacts.  "
150492,"The main result of our paper is the emergence of power laws between the exponential regime and flattening of the COVID-19 epidemic. We believe that the appearance of the power law is related to the lockdowns, imposed social distancing, and long distance travels by asymptomatic carriers. Considering strong similarities between the rumor spreading and epidemics (Daley and Gani 2001) , the long-distance travels and power-law regimes may also play a major role in rumor spreading. Note that the social media and internet provide means for fast transmission of rumor. The aforementioned power-law growth of epidemic appears to have similarities with turbulent diffusion or Taylor diffusion, which is faster than molecular diffusion (Taylor 1954; Leslie 1973; Sreenivasan 2018; Verma 2018 Verma , 2019 . In turbulent diffusion, the separation between two particles, D(t), increases as t 3∕2 , and Ḋ ∼ D 1∕3 . The relative velocity between the particles, Ḋ , increases with time because larger eddies have larger speeds. This feature has a qualitative resemblance with aforementioned long-distance travels by asymptotic carriers. There is possibly another connection of COVID-19 epidemic with turbulence and critical phenomena. In early stages, the epidemic spreads via contacts between infected and susceptible individuals. However, once the epidemic has Fig. 2 (color online) For COVID-19 epidemic: Schematic plots for I(t) and its derivative ̇I (t) vs. t. S1, S2, S3, S4 represent the four stages of the epidemic: exponential growth in count ( exp( t) ), power law growth ( t n ), linear growth (t), and flat spread widely, then indirect transmissions-contacts with infected surfaces, public transport, air-begin to play an important role in the epidemic growth. Such transmissions are referred to as community spread or transmission. This is analogous to interactions among clusters of molecules in phase transition, and those among large fluid vortices in turbulence. Such interactions are responsible for the dynamic scaling in phase transition, and for the aforementioned turbulence diffusion (Wilson and Kogut 1974; Täuber 2017; Taylor 1954; Leslie 1973; Sreenivasan 2018; Verma 2018 Verma , 2019 . Super spreading of COVID-19 and the power-law regime of I(t) may be connected to the above phenomena. Note however that the community spread could also contribute in the exponential growth phase; the two exponential regimes in Fig. 1 may be due to these reasons. These issues need further exploration. The I(t) plots of Fig. 1 exhibit different values for the growth rate and polynomials. These constants depend on various factors, such as immunity levels of the population, climate conditions, extent of lockdowns, levels of testing, social distancing, etc. The slowed progress of the epidemic in India may be due to the stricter and early lockdown. We also believe that a careful study of the I(t) curves may help in forecasting when the epidemic curve will flatten. Now, we summarize our findings. The COVID-19 realtime data of infected individuals, I(t), contains useful information that may help forecast the development of the epidemic. We conjecture that the power law growth of I(t) may be due to the epidemic transmission by asymptomatic carriers traveling long distances, and/or due to community spread. "
152747,"Our estimate of the transmission potential in Lima for the first 16 days of the epidemic indicates sustained local transmission in the region after accounting for multiple case importations with the estimate of reproduction number, R, at ~2.3 (95% CI: 2.0, 2.5) which is comparable to estimates of the reproduction number for China, Korea, and Iran that lie in the range of 1.5-7.1 (Hwang, Park, Kim, Jung, & Kim, 2020; Muniz-Rodriguez et al., 2020; Read, Bridgen, Cummings, Ho, & Jewell, 2020; Shim, Tariq, Choi, Lee, & Chowell, 2020; Wu, Leung, & Leung, 2020) . In contrast, a recent study on Singapore's COVID-19 transmission reported a lower estimate of R at ~0.7, which has been explained as a result of the early implementation of sweeping social distancing interventions . The initial scaling of growth parameter in Lima indicates a nearly exponential growth pattern, consistent with the early spread of the COVID-19 epidemic in Iran and the exponential growth pattern of COVID-19 displayed by the Chinese province of Hubei (Muniz-Rodriguez et al., 2020; Roosa et al., 2020) . In comparison sub-exponential growth patterns of COVID-19 have been observed in Singapore (p~0.7), Korea (p~0.76) and other Chinese provinces excluding Hubei (p~0.67) as described in recent studies (Roosa et al., 2020; Shim et al., 2020; Tariq et al., 2020) . Although Lima has been quick to take aggressive measures against COVID-19, Peru remains one of the hardest hit countries in Latin America (Tegel, 2020) . Despite the closure of country borders on March 16 th , 2020, the number of imported cases in Lima has increased with an average of ~6 imported cases reported between March 16 th -March 30 th , 2020 compared to an average of ~4 imported cases per day before March 16 th , 2020. However, the 20-day ahead forecast of our GGM model calibrated to first 16 epidemic days suggest that the social distancing measures, including closure of schools and the declaration of national emergency are slowing down the virus spread in Lima. The scaling of growth parameter, p, was estimated at ~0.5 (95%CI: 0.5,0.6) after the implementation of social distancing measures, consistent with a linear incidence growth trend. However, the COVID-19 case incidence continues to accumulate despite the quarantine and lockdowns in the region highlighting the need to enhance social distancing measures to further contain the outbreak. The average positivity rate of COVID-19 in Lima was ~8.6% between March 4 th -March 30 th , 2020. This positivity rate for Lima, Peru, corresponds to the positivity rates derived from Denmark, Germany and Canada (6-8%) (Meyer & C.Madrigal, 2020) . In comparison countries like New Zealand, South Korea and Australia have tested widely and exhibit lower positivity rates (2%) whereas Italy and the US have shown much higher positivity rates (15-20%) for COVID-19 indicating suboptimal testing capacity in these countries (Meyer & C.Madrigal, 2020; Project, 2020) . A recent study has shown that changes in testing rates over the course of the epidemic can mask the epidemic growth rate resulting in biased epidemic trends (Omori, Mizumoto, & Chowell, 2020) . Moreover, there is a substantial fraction of asymptomatic COVID-19 cases, which could have underestimated the reproduction number derived from the daily incidence's growth trend of symptomatic cases (Mizumoto, Kagaya, Zarebski, & Chowell, 2020; Wei et al., 2020) . Our study underscores the need for active contact tracing efforts that targets symptomatic and asymptomatic cases, rapid isolation of infectious individuals, quarantined contacts and strict social distancing measures to curb the spread of the virus. In this study we estimate the early transmission potential of SARS-CoV-2 in Lima, Peru. Our current findings point to sustained transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in the early phase of the outbreak, with our estimate of the mean reproduction number ~2.3. The COVID-19 epidemic in Lima followed an early exponential growth trend, which slowed down and turned into an almost linear growth trend (p~0.5), which appears to be tied to broad scale social distancing interventions put in place by the government. While the interventions appear to have slowed the transmission rate, the number of new COVID-19 cases continue to accumulate, highlighting the need to continue social distancing and active case finding efforts to mitigate disease transmission in the region.

152851,"In this paper we describe inequality in a single dimension of learning opportunities during Covid-19: families' daily takeout of digital children's books from libraries. We analyze data with more than 55 million observations and find strong evidence that inequality increased during Covid-19. High-SES families took out more digital (and physical) children's books before the Covid-19 lockdown than low-SES families. During Covid-19, the baseline SES gradient increased: high-SES families consistently took out more digital children's books than low-SES families in each of the three phases of the Covid-19 lockdown. Our results are in line with other research that documents inequality in home schooling activities during Covid-19 (Andrew, et al., 2020; Bol, 2020) , but add to this research by documenting that inequality (in one dimension) increased during Covid-19. We also document that the SES gradient was different in immigrant compared to in native families, stronger in families that had recent experience in taking out digital materials from the library, and stronger in families with children in the early stages of elementary school.

153821,"Results are shown in Figs. 2, 3, 4 for PM 10 , NO 2 and CO, respectively, for all the monitoring stations listed in Table 1 . Some data were not available, especially for Rio de Janeiro. The variability of the data is typical of these locations, as have been shown in previous studies (Tsuruta et al. 2017) . As a general trend, concentrations varied with substantial differences among pollutants and also among the monitoring stations. In general, primary pollutant concentrations showed a decrease in the first days of the partial lockdown (3/23/2020-4/3/2020). As expected, the decrease of pollutants was not directly proportional to the vehicular flux reduction, because it depends on other factors such as meteorological parameters, the transport of air masses and other emission sources. The higher decrease in CO concentrations in comparison to NO 2 was due to the changes in vehicular fleet contributions.

154143,Abstract COVID-19 pandemic is ravaging the world. One of the principle preventive strategies is practicing social distancing. Congregations of the faithful at local and transnational level are strongly recommended by several world religions and religious orders. Gathering of large number of people in close approximation could be a fertile ground for the spread of novel pathogens. The refusal to suspend such gatherings could lead to potential widespread dispersal of infections.
154183,"The COVID-19 pandemic is a global event that has had unprecedented effects on adolescents' daily lives. Reducing the spread of the virus requires individuals to limit physical contact with others by engaging in social distancing. The purpose of this study was to examine adolescents' motivations for social distancing and how these motivations were connected with their perceived degree of social distancing, mental health, and social health. Youth endorsed a variety of prosocial, control, and autonomous motivations for social distancing, including social responsibility, not wanting to personally get sick or get others sick, complying with state or parental rules and peer recommendations, and because alternative activities were unavailable. These motivations were differentially associated with degree of social distancing, as well as depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms, burdensomeness, and belongingness. Adolescents most commonly reported engaging in social distancing for prosocial reasons-including recognition that social distancing is a social responsibility and to help ensure that others do not get sick. Further, social responsibility motivations were associated with engaging in more social distancing. These findings extend previous research which indicates that adolescents' social responsibility values were associated with greater disinfecting behavior and less hoarding behavior in the week following COVID-19 being declared a US national emergency [4] . In contrast, youth who indicated that they were engaging in social distancing because they lacked alternatives reported less social distancing. Youth motivated by a lack of alternatives may be social distancing only if it is convenient and does not conflict with more appealing experiences. Importantly, youth who reported that they were social distancing due to governmental sanctions or parental rules were also more engaged in social distancing compared to those who did not endorse these motives. These findings hold promise for the efficacy of local governments and parents to help increase adolescents' compliance with social distancing recommendations. Adolescents' motivations to engage in social distancing were associated with their mental and social health during the COVID-19 pandemic. For instance, youth who were social distancing to avoid personal illness reported greater anxiety, but also less burdensomeness. Disease-related threat has been shown to prompt feelings of anxiety in youth [21] , and similar processes may be occurring during the COVID-19 pandemic. Alternatively, youth who are more anxious may be more focused on their personal health and thus engage in social distancing as means of self-protection. Although speculative, youth who are social distancing to avoid becoming personally sick may also be more concerned or vigilant, prompting less worry from family members and providing them with a lower sense of burdensomeness. Youth who engaged in social distancing to avoid social judgment reported more anxiety symptoms and those who were social distancing because of friends' recommendations reported greater depressive symptoms. Past research shows that symptomatic youth are more sensitivity to social judgment or peer rejection [22] , which might explain these findings. Our findings highlight how connections between depressive symptoms and social judgments among youth may unfold during a time of heightened social distancing. Notably, we did not find evidence that control motivations for social distancing (i.e., government or parental rules) were negatively associated with mental or social health. Rather, youth who reported social distancing because of parental rules also reported feeling a greater sense of belongingness. Parental monitoring is generally positively correlated with greater warmth [23] . Potentially, youth may interpret parental rules about social distancing as a SOCIAL DISTANCING AND MENTAL HEALTH 13 reflection of warmth, caring, and concern for their well-being. It is also possible that youth with a greater sense of belonging are more likely to follow parental rules. It is important to highlight that a subset of youth (25%) reported that they were social distancing because they would prefer to stay home regardless of whether social distancing policies and recommendations were in place. Youth who reported that they would prefer to stay home also reported lower anxiety and depressive symptoms, relative to those who did not report this motivation. It is possible that youth who prefer stay home may be struggling less with reduced social contact. Conversely, youth who did not indicate that they would prefer to stay home (suggesting that they would rather be engaged in social activity outside of their home) may be at greatest risk for experiencing anxiety or depressive symptoms. Future research is needed to examine the long-term impact of social distancing on the mental and social health of these youth. "
154827,"Abstract Objectives The goal of the present work is to investigate trends among US counties and COVID-19 growth rate in relation to the existence of shelter in place (SIP) orders in that county. Study Design Prospective cohort study. Methods Compound growth rates were calculated using cumulative confirmed COVID-19 cases from January 21, 2020, to March 31, 2020 in all 3,139 US counties. Compound growth was chosen as it gives a single number that can be used in machine learning to represent speed of virus spread during defined time intervals. Statistical analyses and a random forest machine learning model were used to analyze the data for differences in counties with and without shelter in place orders. Results Statistical analyses revealed that the March 16 presidential recommendation (limiting gatherings to < 10 people) lowered the compound growth rate of COVID-19 for all counties in the US by 6.6%, and the counties that implemented SIP after March 16 had a further reduction of 7.8% over the counties with no SIP after March 16. A random forest machine learning model was built to predict compound growth rate after a SIP order and was found to have an accuracy of 92.3%. The random forest found that population, longitude, and population per square mile were the most important features when predicting the effect of SIP. Conclusions Shelter in place orders were found to be effective at reducing the growth rate of COVID-19 cases in the US. Counties with a large population or a high population density were found to benefit the most from a shelter in place order."
155303,"The WHO announced on March 12, 2020 that COVID-19 had become a pandemic [3] . High contagiousness and large-scale international traveling have driven COVID-19 to spread rapidly worldwide [23, 24] . The epidemic in China peaked in early February, 2020 and is currently under control. Much fewer confirmed cases are currently reported compared with the large number of diagnosed cases a month before [25] . However, the global epidemic has worsened in the past two weeks [26, 27] . A total number of 16 462 confirmed cases was reported in Italy on March 12, 2020, compared with 1694 cases on March 1, 2020. In addition, the mortality due to COVID-19 in Italy was reported to be 4.96% higher than that in any other countries worldwide. Similarly, the outbreak in South Korea is growing rapidly, with 7869 infected individuals by March 12, 2020. The statistics above indicates that COVID-19 has become a serious global public health emergency [28] [29] [30] . To better understand the trend of the epidemic, we estimated Re values in China, Italy, Iran, Japan, and South Korea on the basis of published and reported epidemic statistics. Since the lockdown of Wuhan, China, the Re has gradually decreased by continuous strengthening of prevention and control measures. Although a slight rebound occurred due to limited medical resources, the situation eased soon after national rescue and the use of the Huoshenshan Hospital and Mobile Cabin Hospitals. The detection rate of suspected cases has been a key factor affecting the epidemic trend, which depends on the implementation of prevention and control strategies and self-isolation measures by communities and individuals [25, 31] . Given the strict implementation of the prevention and control strategies and the high compliance of individual self-isolation in other provinces in China, the Re rapidly fell below 1 after February 9, 2020. Comprehensive prevention and control measures have achieved initial success, as evidenced by a reduction in the number of new cases. The Re has been less than 1 for a long time since February 10, 2020. Compared with Wuhan after the lockdown, the Re of Italy also decreased but to a smaller extent and rose again in the later period due to limited medical resources. Iran's prevention and control measures are evidently inferior to those of China. Although the Re was reduced to a certain extent, a stable period subsequently appeared (i.e., the optimal control window period was missed). The Re did not decrease until the recent implementation of two nationwide prevention and control strategies. The main features of outbreaks in Japan and South Korea are the inadequate implementation of prevention and control strategies, which has resulted in multiple recurrences of the epidemic and great fluctuation of Re. Notably, the progress made in the prevention and control of the epidemic in South Korea gradually showed preliminary effects, with the number of new confirmed cases below 100 for two consecutive days from February 14 to 15, 2020. The government has strong prevention and control efforts and responded quickly [32] . On March 1, 2020, South Korea announced a state of war. In terms of prevention and control, the government conducted a series of management strategies such as tracing the source of the disease, preventing the spread of the disease, focusing on detection, greatly improving the detection efficiency, and shortening the detection process and cycle. A key step in prevention and control is to identify close contacts of confirmed and suspected cases and prevent the occurrence of unknown second-or third-generation cases. The Korean Centers for Disease Control and Prevention monitors patient exposure through medical facility records, global positioning system, credit card transaction records, and closed-circuit television information. Quarantine and isolation were strictly applied to control the epidemic. In addition, the public awareness of the epidemic has been raised [32] . The government's cooperation in the prevention and control of the epidemic has greatly improved, which is optimistic for the control against COVID-19. According to the comparison of Re between countries, the enforcement of Chinese policies is remarkably more effective than that of several other countries worldwide. Since the implementation of the prevention and control strategy, the epidemic has hardly rebounded in China. However, outbreaks in South Korea and Japan have repeatedly occurred, and the Re has not fallen below 1, indicating that the epidemic situation has not been effectively controlled and that the number of cumulative cases will continue to increase (Fig. 3) . Furthermore, given the limited effectiveness of the early prevention and control strategies, the situation in Iran is still not optimistic. The trend of the epidemic in Iran and Italy depends on the strength and execution of the later prevention and control strategies and public compliance. Despite the findings, this study has several limitations. Considering the change of parameters due to practical situations, such as continuous control measures, the model should update dynamically according to the updated epidemic statistics. Qualitative description was applied to explain the rapid decline of Re in China without considering other confounding factors. Further studies should focus more on the causal relationship between control measures and the COVID-19 epidemic. "
156017,"Following the analysis of different European and Asian countries heavily affected by COVID-19, our data indicate significant differences in initial growth rates and doubling time. According to our data, European countries seem to have missed effective measures to contain COVID-19 at the beginning of the crisis compared to their counterparts in Asia. This is further substantiated by continuously, rapidly increasing COVID-19 case numbers in European countries, which call for more draconic containment measures. "
156614,"Corona virus diseases-2019 (COVID-19), an infectious disease identified in late December, 2019, in Wuhan city of China, was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization. Most countries including India have announced some sort of lockdown to reduce the effects of COVID-19 and discontinue the transmission of novel coronavirus. Major negative effects on the social and surrounding environment have been reported due to COVID-19, however positive effects have also been observed with respect to air quality. Secondary results have been taken from National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), indicating significant reduction (50%) in air quality of Indian region. This perspective highlights the effects of the lockdown due to COVID-19 on aerosol optical thickness specifically in India."
156917,"Ambient air quality for Delhi, London, Paris, and Wuhan cities for the lockdown month with the number of days for the years 2019 and 2020 as shown in Table 1 is considered for calculating the health damage cost due to air pollutants. During the lockdown days due to limited transportation and industrial output, air pollution is significantly reduced (Wang et al. 2020b ). Some of the air pollutants came within the World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines (Jordan 2020) just a few days into the lockdown. NO 2 concentration for all the cities during the lockdown is less than the WHO limit every day, whereas breach is observed for the year 2019. Pollutant such as PM 2.5 , PM 10 , NO x , and SO 2 results in various health damages such as respiratory diseases, COPD, cardiovascular diseases, and mortality. These pollutants are considered to calculate corresponding health damage cost. It can be observed that SO 2 concentration was below the acceptable permissible limit set by International guidelines (WHO 2006) . Hence, no health damage due to pollutant was considered. The daily mean of PM 2.5 , PM 10 and daily averages for NO 2 during the month of lockdown days in 2020 and the same month for the previous year 2019 was found beyond the acceptable limit, thereby health damage assessment is carried out by certain set of formulas (Eqs. (1)- (3)) (Maji et al. 2017) . In order to quantify the impacts in monetary terms, it is essential to understand the mechanism by which the impact happens. The impact pathway approach (Bherwani et al. 2019; Ghorani-Azam et al. 2016 ) reveals how emitted pollutants lead to different adverse outcomes on human wellbeing and other natural environments. In the current research, we are primarily focusing on human health impacts of AP, and the same is quantified in monetary terms. Basic parameter of the number of people affected under morbidity and mortality are calculated using Eqs. (1)-(3) using the available data. The factors for each of the pollutant parameter are taken from Table 2 . The reference concentration for the pollutants is taken from the WHO guidelines. The cases of morbidity and mortality under each heading of disease for each city are summarized in Table 8 . While standard deviations have been reported in pollutant concentration, relative risks, and baseline incidences, the resolution of calculation for multiplicative parameters using standard deviation may yield complex variations in the results. Hence, the morbidity and mortality assessments have been done on average values. From Table 8 , it can be seen that PM 2.5 is the most damaging parameter affecting many people in all cities. The highest cases are reported in Delhi due to PM; however, no cases due to NO 2 in 2019. Since it has the highest number of cases to start with, the lockdown indicates the highest reduction as well. While this will hold true for monetary benefit as well or not is discussed later. Wuhan indicates the second-highest number of people affected; however, reduction in 2020 appears to be low. London and Paris show a similar size of cases. Figure 2 indicates the morbidity and mortality between the two years 2019 and 2020. The valuation of morbidity is carried out for cardiovascular and respiratory diseases, including general respiratory ailments, asthma and COPD. COI is used to include the expenditure of treatment, including the outpatient and in-patient costs related to the ailment. The COI for each city, based on national averages, have been used for diseases, as indicated in Table 6 . The valuation of the cost of treatment of morbidity is evaluated using Eq. (6). Apart from the treatment expenditure, the reduction in functionality of an individual also leads to massive losses to the economy. This is often evaluated as DALY and is valued as well. For valuation, per capita income is used as a surrogate measure for the individuals getting effected along with DALYs associated with their diseases. The data related to DALY and per capita income based on city GDP averages is given in Table 4 and Table 5 , respectively. The DALY-related valuation is carried out using Eq. (5). The morbidity valuation is shown in Table 9 while Fig. 3 represents a comparative loss of all cities due to AP morbidity in the years 2019 and 2020. It can be seen from Fig. 3 that the highest benefit in terms of absolute numbers and in terms of percentage reduction of about 38% is seen by Delhi, which also happens to be one of the most polluted cities in the world. The lockdown scenario must have brought down the pollution levels drastically bringing a huge benefit to the city. In terms of change, Paris also sees a considerable reduction with morbidity damages reduced by almost 35%. The city of Wuhan and London see a similar kind of drop in terms of percentage reduction of about 19 to 20%. While the morbidity damages are in millions of dollars, it is evident that they have reduced considerably as compared to the previous year, indicating that the lockdown has improved air quality thereby saving of millions of dollars and more importantly an improved health and associated intangibles. Mortality valuation is done using VSL, which is usually evaluated for low-to moderate-income groups in order to avoid overshooting the valuations. The value of statistical life for individuals staying in different countries is given in Table 3 and is used for the mortality Air Qual Atmos Health cases as evaluated by the relative risk and baseline incidences reported by WHO. Table 10 gives the mortality valuation under each category of disease for the respective pollutants. The equation used for valuation for mortality damages is given in the ""Methodology"" section as Eq. (4). Figure 4 gives a year-wise comparison of the benefits produced by lockdown in 2020 in terms of mortality reduction. It is to be noted that mortality damages are reported as total mortality, and within that, there is respiratory and cardiovascular mortality. The total mortalities of particulate matter and nitrogen dioxide have been added to get the total value of damage related to mortality, which then further includes mortalities related to other factors of AP. A similar result is obtained as in case of morbidity. Delhi has the greatest benefit with almost 49% reduction in damages related to mortality due to lockdown followed by Paris with 39% reduction, London with 29%, and Wuhan having 26% reduction. Further, in terms of absolute numbers, the reduction of damages is highest in Delhi, followed by London, Wuhan, and Paris, respectively. Overall, mortality and morbidity represent the total loss due to AP in the select cities. The damages have been added and compared to the economic damages caused during the considered lockdown of these cities. The economic damages have been reported at the country level; the ratio of the GDPs of the corresponding cities is taken to normalize the damages for cities. The raw data with respect to economic damages and GDP ratios are given in Table 7 . The overall damages and economic damages are shown in Table 11 . Valuation of AP damages for 2019 and 2020 gives an understanding of the magnitude of damages which occurs due to AP. Due to lockdown, there is a drastic reduction in AP as indicated by 2020 scenario in Table 8 and  Table 11 , leading to the prevention of AP-related damages. It can be seen from Table 11 that the highest prevention happens in terms of absolute magnitude and percentage in Delhi. London has the second-highest amount of prevention in terms of absolute numbers but falls behind Paris in terms of percentage benefit. Wuhan has the lowest prevention in terms of magnitude and percentage. When compared with the economic damages, as indicated in Fig. 5 above, actually Wuhan has the highest normalized benefit due to AP reduction, followed by Delhi, London, and Paris, respectively. This is evidently shown in terms of damage prevented per unit economic damage, which is highest for Wuhan 1.85, followed by Delhi 1.19, London 0.11, and Paris 0.03.  This study highlights that although the world is fighting with COVID-19 and suffering from huge economic losses, due to reduced cohesive situation for work, the environment is benefitted. This further is demonstrated in monetary terms for reduced health damages related to air pollution. The exposure and impact assessment is carried out for Delhi, London, Paris, and Wuhan, using relative risk and baseline indices of various air pollutants including PM 2.5 , PM 10 , and NO 2 . The study further incorporates monetization of the impacts for 2019 and 2020, to gauge the magnitude of impact reduction of air pollution under COVID-19 lockdown scenario. The monetary assessment of damages is done using econometric approaches like VSL, CoI, and PCI for DALY. The key conclusions are summarized as follows: 1. PM 2.5 is one of the major contributors to the burden of disease related to AP. Delhi, being one of the most polluted cities globally, is the worst affected. PM 10 and NO 2 impacts are also considerable, while SO 2 is found within WHO guidelines limits for both 2019 and 2020. Monetarily, the impact is curtailed by average 36% in mortality and about 28% in morbidity in the year 2020 due to substantial reduction in AP amid reduced anthropogenic activities owing to COVID-19 lockdown. In terms of an absolute number of people affected, an average 31% reduction is for combined mortality and morbidity for all cities. Impacts of NO 2 are zeroed for the year 2020. For PM 2.5 mortality cases, Delhi sees the highest fall in the number of cases for 2020 from 2019, followed by Paris, Wuhan, and London, in that order. It can be seen the trend in mortality damages between the cities is not similar to morbidity, indicating that there could be other compounding factors like age, life expectancy, and standard of living in these cities. 4. The total of morbidity and mortality damages reduction in 2020 is compared with the economic damages being reported for the cities. It is reported that London (18.6B$) suffered maximum economic damage during its respective lockdown days, while Wuhan suffered the lowest (0.56B$). Paris (15.81B$) and Delhi (5.36B$) suffered the second-highest and lowest damages, respectively. Delhi, London, Wuhan, and Paris prevented AP damages worth 6.4B$, 2.09B$, 0.97B$, and 0.47 B$, respectively, in 2020. This indicates that Wuhan and Delhi could extract better worth from prevention of damages from lockdown as compared to their lockdown losses. This might be due to the fact that both these cities are highly polluted as compared to Paris and London and are economically developing as well. Wuhan is actually higher as the economic damages incurred by that city are the lowest. The lowest recovery is made by Paris, while London stands at second-lowest. It is apparent that while quantifying AP damages in terms of exposure and affected population is fruitful, there are more insights which can be explored to understand the true magnitude of the damage caused by it. The monetary evaluation gives a common denomination for comparison and for making a rational decision for policy formulation. The above research of four major global cities demonstrates that while the world is suffering from enormous economic damage, the lockdown has created some positive for the air environment and hence the human health as well. While the above analysis might hold true for the majority of the cities suffering from a probable of AP, a detailed analysis should be carried out for the respective city before making decisions. Accounting of the cost and benefits due to halting of anthropogenic activities gives us a clear indication of the change of damage being incurred on the ecosystem and on human health. It further suggests that stronger policies are needed to safeguard the ecosystem balance.  "
156934,"From equations (3.1) to (3.8) and since the states and are sink vertices in the model graph  ( see Figure 1 ), then they are considered as accumulative state variables that rely only on their own starting situations and the other state variables. Since summing up all equations (3.1) to (3.8) gives zero as a result then the system is compartmentalized and shows the conservation property of mass : as can be directly proved, Which implies that the total population (the sum of all state variables) is constant. Let (3.10) be the state variables vector. Since the state variables signify the population fractions, we can suppose that ∑ , such that 1 signifies the total population, dead are included. ; ; ; ; 20)   3  3  3  3  31  32   3  3  2  33  3  34   3  3  3  3  35  3  36  3  37   3 3 38 0 ( ) ; ; ;  This research has been carried out to the analysis of an eight dimension fractional -order SIDARTHE COVID-19 mathematical model. In this 8-D CVID-19 mathematical model, the infected population fraction is partitioned into five different population fractions: . It is the first time to study such model with fractional order. The existence of stable solution of the fractional order SIDARTHE model is proved. The fractional order necessary conditions for a four optimal control strategies are implemented. In addition, the system dynamics displayed via the fraction order numerical solver by MATLAB software with different fractional orders and the effects of changing the infection rates parameters are presented in this manuscript with different fractional orders. The effects of changing the fractional order on the system Lyapunov exponent are also displayed. The dynamics of the system are presented before and after control. From our study, we can state that decreasing the fractional derivative order decreases the number of cases in all population fraction phases and delays the maximum plus changing the value of the fractional derivative order has no effect on the stability of the system since its all Lyapunov exponents still negative. The proposed 38 fractional order COVID-19 SIDARTHE model predicts the evolution of COVID-19 epidemic and try to help in understanding the impact of different plans to limit the diffusion of this epidemic with different values of the fractional order. Our results confirm the importance of decreasing the infection rates. Decreasing the infection rates include taking various actions like insure the social distance, closing the airports, closing all teaching authorities, random testing the asymptomatic cases and contact tracing. The author hope that the COVID-19 study using the proposed model continues. And via utilizing the real data the optimum fractional order can be estimated. "
157146,"We correlate the average monthly high temperatures and the population density of different geographical areas with number of deaths/1 M people. The data were analyzed for the month of March and April. We did not find any correlation between temperatures and number of deaths in the month of March. On the contrary, there was a strong statistical correlation between the temperature values and number of deaths in the month of April. These data were further confirmed when we used latitude as a proxy of the temperature. It is noteworthy to remember that in all the areas considered, lockdown measures were implemented between the end of March and beginning of April (except in Lombardy and Sicily, Italy, which started earlier), and all had substantial forms of social distancing by April. Our results indicate that the areas considered started from a very similar number of deaths in the month of March, but the implementation of social distancing seems to be more successful in those areas with higher average monthly temperatures during the month of April. We could not find a correlation between population density and number of deaths once the especially densely populated areas were removed. These data seem to indicate a possible threshold of population density as a factor contributing to virus spread. Our data indicate that social distancing measures are more successful in the presence of higher daily temperature in reducing COVID-19-related death rates. On the contrary, high level of population density seems to reduce the effect of lockdown measures. Though more studies are necessary to confirm these data, we believe they help understand the impact of temperature on COVID-19-related death rate and modeling the containment measures according to different geographical areas. The not linear correlation between these two variables is calculated using the squared transformation of the population density including the three highly densely populated areas (New York City, Los Angeles and Washington, DC), and c excluding these areas. The p-values for each month are indicated "
157319,"We investigated the effects of city lockdowns on air quality based on ground-based observations in both urban and rural areas in Hangzhou. Results indicate that during lockdown relative to the period before lockdown, concentrations of PM 2.5 , PM 10 , CO, and NO 2 displayed significantly decreasing trends, as expected, while an overall rising trend was observed for O 3 in both urban and rural areas, which is explained by the 'absence' of NO x . The sharp decreases in the NO 2 concentrations in the urban area during the lockdown were mainly a result of direct traffic emission reductions, whereas in the rural area decreases were mainly from less regional transport. SO 2 mean concentrations in the urban area decreased from 6.3 to 5.3 μg m −3 , as expected, but increased in rural areas from 4.7 to 5.8 μg m −3 , a consequence of increases in coal combustion for heating and firework emissions. Mean O 3 concentrations increased significantly from 24.6 before lockdown to 60.6 μg m −3 during lockdown in the urban area, whereas the corresponding rural O 3 levels modestly increased from 42.0 to 62.9 μg m −3 . Here the O 3 increase in the urban areas is explained by the reduction in NO x emissions. Overall, the city lockdown improved air quality Fig. 3 Change percentages of the daily average concentrations of ambient PM 2.5 , PM 10 , CO, NO 2 , SO 2 and daily maximum 8 h-O 3 concentration during January and February in 2020 relative to those in 2019 in Hangzhou in (a) the urban area and (b) the rural area. As indicated in Fig. 3a and Fig. 3b , PM 2.5 and PM 10 concentrations in the urban areas experienced a sharp decrease on January 24, and then remained relatively larger negative percentages (below − 75%) during a few days from January 24-27. The simultaneous quick drops after January 24 also occurred for PM 2.5 and PM 10 levels at the rural site with the minimum values as low as − 96% and − 95.6% on January 26, respectively by reducing PM 2.5 , PM 10 , CO, and NO 2 , but also decreased air quality by augmenting O 3 in both urban and rural areas and SO 2 in the rural area in Hangzhou.

The significant positive correlation (r = 0.51) between the change in traffic density and NO 2 in the urban area of Hangzhou in Fig. 4a further explains NO 2 decreases during lockdown in 2020 due to direct traffic emission reductions. A weak positive correlation between the change in traffic density and NO 2 at the rural site in Fig. 4a indicates that NO 2 in the rural area did not arise mainly from direct traffic emissions rather from regional transport "

Over the course of several weeks, the initial phases involving realization, preparing and reorganization have progressed. Now, the need for comprehensive data, international cooperation and evidencebased guidelines is essential for effective decision-making in returning to normal activity while minimizing viral spread and reducing secondary negative effects.

158050,"The coronavirus 2019 (COVID‐19) pandemic has led to laws and policies including national school closures, lockdown or shelter in place laws, and social distancing recommendations that may translate to higher overall screen time among children and adolescents for the duration of these laws and policies. These policies may need to be periodically re‐instated to control future COVID‐19 recurrences or other national emergencies. Excessive screen time is associated with cardiovascular disease risk factors such as obesity, high blood pressure, and insulin resistance because it increases sedentary time and is associated with snacking"
158417,"In this paper, we have used statistical theory to predict the growth and reduction of pandemic infections using infection rate as a measure of observed outcomes of the infection process. We have showed that the traditional person-to-person R 0 model is a special case of this new societal learning theory. Based on publicly available data, the analyses for many countries and regions show that the CoVid-19 transmission and incubation rate is circa 5 days, independent of global location. After infection rate peaking, consistent with world outcome data, the recovery trajectories follow the Universal Learning Curve (Universal Recovery Curve), and different countermeasures result in differing growth and decline trajectories. The theory and analysis here presented, indeed provide fundamental insights useful for risk handling during the development of and recovery from a pandemic. "
158595,"It is urgent to understand the future of severe acute respiratory syndrome–coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) transmission. We used estimates of seasonality, immunity, and cross-immunity for betacoronaviruses OC43 and HKU1 from time series data from the USA to inform a model of SARS-CoV-2 transmission. We projected that recurrent wintertime outbreaks of SARS-CoV-2 will probably occur after the initial, most severe pandemic wave. Absent other interventions, a key metric for the success of social distancing is whether critical care capacities are exceeded. To avoid this, prolonged or intermittent social distancing may be necessary into 2022. Additional interventions, including expanded critical care capacity and an effective therapeutic, would improve the success of intermittent distancing and hasten the acquisition of herd immunity. Longitudinal serological studies are urgently needed to determine the extent and duration of immunity to SARS-CoV-2. Even in the event of apparent elimination, SARS-CoV-2 surveillance should be maintained since a resurgence in contagion could be possible as late as 2024."
158807,"As coronavirus continues to spread, research on factors that inhibit preventative 284 behaviors is urgently needed. The present study offers novel empirical evidence that associating 285 coronavirus with death predicts reluctance to perform recommended preventative behaviors such 286 as social distancing and handwashing. Further, we show that coronavirus-related worry, age, 287 race, perceived ability to take sick leave, and work-related self-esteem are predictive of 288 associating coronavirus with death. These findings can help inform our understanding of and 289 responses to the global coronavirus pandemic. 290  "
158848,"In Poland, compared to other European countries, far-reaching solutions were implemented relatively early to reduce the spread of infection. Six days after the first laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 case, all mass events in Poland were banned. All schools and universities were closed 8 days after the first COVID-19 case. After 11 days, significant travel restrictions and the 14 days self-quarantine obligation for travelers were introduced. Due to the ongoing epidemic, it is too early to forecast the impact of the adopted policies on the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in Poland. Further studies should compare the impact of different public health interventions intended to mitigate the spread of coronavirus across the EU countries. e924730-6 "
161991,"To our knowledge, this is the first report published after the start of the epidemic showing a decrease in psychiatric admission rates during the lockdown period in an area of Lombardy with nearly 1.4 million inhabitants. Two DMHAs involved in this analysis (Brescia and Cremona) cater for two of the most COVID affected areas in the world, with the highest number of deaths. Our data show that immediately after the lockdown initiated by the Government (active as of March 11), there has been a marked drop in the average daily number of admissions to seven GHPWs included in this study, and this continued up to the end of the index period (March 31, 2020). The reduction was statistically significant for voluntary admissions and was visible for all diagnostic groups, with the only exception for people with anxiety disorders, neurocognitive disorders, etc. The same trend was visible in all sites in the period April 1-27, 2020, when there were 118 voluntary admissions to the seven GHPWs, with a further, statistically significant reduction compared to March 2020 (164 admissions, p = 0.007). It is uncertain whether the lockdown imposed by the government caused the main effect as much as the pandemic itself did. While annual admission rates per 1000 population >18 in January (1.94) and February (2.30) 2020 were numerically higher as compared to the national admission rate recorded in 2017 (1.90, last year available), in March 2020, this rate decreased to a value (1.60) which is 15.8% lower than the national figure. The median length of hospitalization in March 2020 (14 days) was significantly longer than in March 2019 (10 days). What are the likely explanations for the reduction in admission rates?' Which are the factors that can explain this reduction in hospitalization rates in the 40 days after the start of the epidemic in Lombardy? We can suggest some hypotheses: "
162170,"The 2019 novel‐coronavirus (COVID‐19) has affected 181 countries with approximately 1197405 confirmed cases (by 5th April). Understanding the transmission dynamics of the infection in each country which got affected on a daily basis and evaluating the effectiveness of control policies are critical for our further actions. To date, the statistics of COVID‐19 reported cases show that more than 80% of infected are mild cases of disease, around 14% of infected have severe complications, and about 5% are categorized as critical disease victims. Today's report (5th April 2020; daily updates in the prepared website) shows that the confirmed cases of COVID‐19 in the United States, Spain, Italy, and Germany are 308850, 126168, 124632, and 96092, respectively. Calculating the total case fatality rate (CFR) of Italy (4th April 2020), about 13.3% of confirmed cases have passed away. Compared with South Korea's rate of 1.8% (seven times lower than Italy) and China's 4% (69% lower than Italy), the CFR of Italy is too high. Some effective policies that yielded significant changes in the trend of cases were the lockdown policy in China, Italy, and Spain (the effect observed after some days), the shutdown of all nonessential companies in Hubei (the effect observed after 5 days), combined policy in South Korea, and reducing working hours in Iran."
162292,"Abstract Since the declaration of the COVID-19 pandemic, a lot of data has invaded our lives, and the conflicting findings have caused us to be frantic about the correct course action. Strict isolation and social distancing measures can flatten the coronavirus infectious curve, and the use of facemask needs to be encouraged and facilitated in crowded places, particularly in hospitals where the 6-feet social distancing cannot be adopted because of physical barriers."
162393,"Countries that implemented liberal testing with active case finding and prompt isolation, combined with contact tracing and quarantine, were more successful in reducing the reproduction number compared to countries that primarily relied on social distancing and lockdown measures."
163545,"We found similar estimates of reproducibility number and the proportion of the Spanish population contaminated by the new coronavirus, whether they were estimated from hospitalization numbers or detected cases. Both estimates from case reports and hospitalizations suggest that only mandatory quarantine achieved R0 lower than 1, while R0 during state of emergency before nonessential services were shut down was estimated to be well beyond 1. This predicts that the opening of the non-essential services by April 13 may lead to a new surge of cases. Based on this empirical study, mandatory confinement is the only state-wise measure that effectively reduces the number of contaminations. Estimates based on death reports differed considerably from those based on either hospitalizations or detected cases. This suggests that some of the assumptions and data our modeling is based on may not be accurate (although commonly used in previous studies), and shows that this can induce very large biases in the estimation of the propagation of the new coronavirus in Spain. A crucial pre-requisite for the reliability of our estimates is that the proportion of events do not vary in time. That was likely not the case neither for detected cases, as the testing policy evolved during the period of study, nor for deaths, as the saturation of health systems may have led to higher death tolls and reporting of deaths in retirement homes evolved. As the proportion of hospitalized cases is believed to be more stable across time, we believe that estimates based on the latter are more reliable than estimates based on either reported cases or deaths. Below, we further comment on the results obtained with the hospitalization reports. Our approach is similar to a study by an Imperial College team published last week inferring the infecting depends on the days from infection. 10 Nor do it take into account mobility between regions, whose impact is believed to be more important at the initiation of the epidemics. It is also worth noting that in a locked down environment where most contacts are compartmentalized in households, it is possible that at beginning the virus continues to spread rapidly within households, but less so between households. As immunity was not taken care here, 0 may J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f decrease significantly more without further policies, after this first wave of within-household contamination is over. Finally, we only modeled the impact of lockdown, not of other measures which were taken too close apart (banning public events, closing schools, etc.), and simultaneously in most regions, so it is not possible here to disentangle their effects precisely. The analysis also did not take into account other changes that have occurred during this period, such as measures at an individual level or at the level of companies and local institutions (usage of masks, hands washing, etc.). In conclusion, the greatest interest should be focused on the trends in R0 found in this work, which show drastic successive reductions after the implementation of the state of urgency and forced quarantines. "
164010,"A hypothetical model that evaluated the effect of formal and informal sources of information on situational awareness (perceived understanding) and ultimately adoption of protective behavior (social distancing) was studied. Results obtained suggest that both When comparing the trust of the general public on information sources, it was revealed that trust in the formal sources is slightly higher in comparison with informal sources. Moreover, another outcome of this study, that is, situational awareness affects the adoption of social distancing behavior which is also consistent with the previously reported surveys conducted to evaluate the effect of formal information sources on the adoption of HPB during A/H1N1 influenza pandemic 2009. 9 Rubin and his colleagues reported that information from media sources increased the adoption of hygiene behavior which led to increased tissue and sanitizer use among British masses during the endemic swine flu. 42 The model developed in this study suggested that social distancing is not linked with formal messages. This outcome supports the fact that social distancing is adopted when a perceived health threat is high. 22 Another outcome suggests that when friends and peers behave responsibly, a person also adopts protective behavior. However, mixed signals from peers and friends led to the declined utility In South Asia, Pakistan is the first country to experience a high severity of CVOID-19 infection. Our study concludes that at the time of such a public health crisis formal information sources (formal and informal) play a significant role in increasing awareness among masses and cognitively influence the adoption of social distancing practices. The world is facing serious COVID-19 pandemic; this necessitates situational awareness for the adoption of health care protective practices. We believe that the variables studied have  "
164235,"Social distancing policies were implemented in most US states as a containment strategy against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The effectiveness of these policy interventions on morbidity and mortality remains unknown. Our analysis examined the associations between statewide policies and objective measures of social distancing, and objective social distancing and COVID-19 incidence and mortality. We used nationwide, de-identified smartphone GPS data to estimate county-level social distancing. COVID-19 incidence and mortality data were from the Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center. Generalized linear mixed models were used to estimate incidence rate ratios (IRRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the association between objective social distancing and COVID-19 incidence and mortality. Stay-at-home orders were associated with a 35% increase in social distancing. Higher social distancing was associated with a 29% reduction in COVID-19 incidence (adjusted IRR 0.71; 95% CI 0.57-0.87) and a 35% reduction in COVID-19 mortality (adjusted IRR 0.65; 95% CI 0.55-0.76). These findings provide evidence to inform ongoing national discussions on the effectiveness of these public health measures and the potential implications of returning to normal social activity."
164320,"Fractional calculus provides a useful tool to modeling complex dynamics in biology, and this study extended the FDE for modeling the coronavirus outbreak. The COVID-19 is a pandemic Third, a stochastic model based on the Lagrangian scheme for the time FDEs, analogous to a mixing-limited reaction mechanism model, showed that self-quarantine may not be as effective as strict social distancing, since not all the infected people can be diagnosed and immediately quarantined. While strict social distancing can apparently slow COVID-19 spread, the pandemic may last longer. This is another case that fractional calculus may be used to explore COVID-19 outbreak. Therefore, one of the main contributions of this study is to extend the application of FDEs to model dynamics and mitigation scenarios of the coronavirus spread. "
164520,"The lockdown and social distancing to combat the covid-19 virus has generated significant disruptions on consumer behavior. All consumption is time bound and location bound. With time flexibility but location rigidity, consumers have learned to improvise in creative and innovative ways. The work-life boundaries are now blurred as people work at home, study at home, and relax at home. Since the consumer is unable to go to the store, the store has to come to the consumer. As consumers adapt to the house arrest for a prolonged period of time, they are likely to adopt newer technologies which facilitate work, study and consumption in a more convenient manner. Embracing digital technology is likely to modify existing habits. Finally, public policy will also impose new consumption habits especially in public places such as airports, concerts, and public parks. "
164545,"Key findings: 1. Globally, we observe a considerable reduction in flows across most countries. With international airline traffic suspended by most countries, the inter-country flows have seen a significant drop. The US and India have had a 74% and 87% drop in international flows, respectively. 2. Overall, the state-level social distancing strategies across the US and the lock-down enforcement across India have paid dividends in reducing mobility with the US experiencing a maximum drop of 42% (Q1 : −48% and Q3 : −40%) compared to usual flows across the states during the week where most states had declared SAHO. In India, on the other hand, there was a maximum drop of 68% (Q1 : −72% and Q3 : −66%) across states compared to the baseline due the lock-down declaration. "
164702,"Our results suggest that social distancing and shelter in place has had some impact on crime and disorder, but only for a restricted collection of crime types and not consistently across places. A recent study (Campedelli, Aziani, & Favarin, 2020) found crime rates to be marginally lower in Los Angeles. Burglary does show some signs of being down, but primarily based on lower calls-for-service in Los Angeles. Robbery calls and reported crimes were also down in Los Angeles. Vehicle crimes show some signs of being up, but again primarily based on calls-for-service in Los Angeles. The most robust patterns to emerge, in both Los Angeles and Indianapolis, were a substantial decrease in traffic stops and a substantial increase in domestic violence calls-forservice. However, the increase in domestic violence calls did not appear to seriously impact reported aggravated assaults. We note that not all domestic violence calls are assaults involving aggravating circumstances. Many such calls prove to be domestic disturbances without violence (MacDonald, Manz, Alpert, & Dunham, 2003) . This finding also has implications for officer safety. Incidents of domestic violence present one of the riskiest incidents for officer injury (Johnson, 2008 (Johnson, , 2011 and also use of force (MacDonald et al., 2003) . Thus, agencies should consider mechanisms to reinforce training of how to effectively and safely respond to domestic violence calls for service in light of social distancing. The marginal decline in residential burglaries, marginal increase in auto thefts, and increase in domestic violence calls, points to shifts in crime patterns to which police departments will necessarily have to respond. These shifts, however, are perhaps less substantial than might be expected from the wholesale disruption of social and economic life brought on by COVID-19. Despite the imposition of broad social distancing regulations, our findings suggest that the routines of daily life that help to generate crime remain unchanged in most ways. Social distancing policies have had an important, but less than complete, impact on day-to-day life. This conclusion is reinforced when we examine calls-for-service and reported crime volume against Google mobility data. Fig. 4 shows activity distributions derived from device location information and known or inferred location types. In Los Angeles and Indianapolis, routine activities begin to change approximately 8-10 days before shelter in place orders. The data show a definite shift towards activity concentrated in and around people's homes. Burglary and vandalism calls were significantly lower in Los Angeles as a function of the shift in activity to the home, taking into account multiple model comparisons (Table 3) . Vehicle theft calls increased significantly in Los Angeles. Domestic violence calls increased significantly as a function of the activity shift in both Los Angeles and Indianapolis. The results for reported crime are very similar. Burglary and robbery events were down and vehicle thefts up in Los Angeles, while the effects on aggravated (Table 4 ). However, as many call and crime categories were not significantly altered as a function of the shift in routine activities. This is particularly true in Indianapolis, but also for certain crime types in Los Angles. It is worth noting that the practical differences in volume of calls per day are quite small. With the exception of burglary calls in Los Angeles (Δy = -19.27) and domestic violence calls in both Los Angeles and Indianapolis (Δy = 13.55 and Δy = 15.22, respectively), no other call or crime type experienced a change in volume of more than 8.8 events per day. In cities the size of Los Angeles (≈4 mil) and Indianapolis (≈0.8 mil), these are small differences in day-to-day crime and disorder. Overall, in spite of apparent changes to routine activities, people were still finding opportunities to commit crimes at approximately the same level as before the crisis. Moving forward, calls-for-service and crime numbers can be compared with local data on new infections. Where individuals and communities avoid complying with existing social distancing measures, governments may consider alternative approaches. In some instances, police departments may find themselves engaged in more direct enforcement of limitations on social and economic activity. Meanwhile, as some jurisdictions consider relaxing social distancing measures, police departments may again face a changing crime environment. Finally, we note several limitations of the present study. First, the results presented here are specific to Los Angeles and Indianapolis and may not generalize to other cities in the U.S. Second, though calls for service remain relatively stable during pre-and post-social distancing temporal periods examined here, we are not able to determine if social distancing influences whether individuals are more or less likely to report incidents of crime. However, despite domestic violence having been one of the crimes least reported to the police, with approximately half of all domestic victimization being unreported (Reaves, 2017) , our results indicate that calls concerning domestic violence significantly increased in both Indianapolis and Los Angeles. Furthermore, police  "
165130,"Early detection of viral outbreaks is essential to ensuring available resources for notification and isolation of cases, contact tracing, and quarantine. We find that monthly testing of 100% of the campus community is required to detect an outbreak when there are less than 9 or fewer detectable cases in the community, unless at least 30% of infected people develop symptoms that lead them to be tested HS. Even for the latter case, detection of outbreak when there are 9 or fewer detectable cases requires that 75% of the population be tested. As the percent tested declines, the size of the detectable populations increases fairly rapidly as testing levels decrease if the proportion of infected people is only 1 or 5%. But the increase is much slower if 30% or 60% do so; hence, monitoring of the university population for COVID-19 symptoms should be encouraged-especially if it is not feasible to implement high levels of testing. Our study is the first to examine what NAT testing rates are required to detect a SARS-CoV-2 outbreak at an early stage. Other studies have examined what testing and isolation is required to prevent an outbreak or reduce the reproduction number to below 1, indicating that to   ()   .   prevent an outbreak with testing and case isolation alone testing of the entire population twice weekly is required [2] . Importantly, our analysis does not examine what is required to curtail the outbreak, only what is required to detect it at an early stage. At this point, epidemiological measures including contact tracing and isolation of infected and exposed individuals might be able terminate the spread of this particular viral introduction within the community-but investigation of the conditions under which this can be achieved is warranted. Previous mathematical models indicate that contact tracing and isolation of symptomatic contacts would likely require a very high rate of contacts traced in order to reduce the reproduction number to below 1, and could still result in very large outbreak sizes [3] . However, this same study indicates that contact tracing efficacy could be lower if initial outbreak sizes are smaller, supporting efforts to identify outbreaks at an earlier stage. Additionally, we did not examine the impact of isolation of asymptomatic contacts which is possible in a university setting and could provide additional risk mitigation benefit. Further, social distancing interventions could be implemented after the point of outbreak detection which could further reduce transmission [4] . Early SARS-CoV-2 outbreak detection is achievable with high rates of NAT testing (100%/month) or possibly with lower rates of testing but a high proportion of infected people-even those with mild symptoms--presenting at HS for testing. Testing needs to be combined with   ()   . ()    "
165430,"In this work, we constructed a mathematical model for COVID-19 transmission in Wuhan. Based on mathematical analysis and data fitting, we revealed the effects of lockdown and medical resources. It was found that the later Wuhan takes the lockdown measures, the lower the peak value of new infections and the smaller the final scale. Moreover, although the late implementation of lockdown measures will reduce the scale of the epidemic in this city, due to the fact that Wuhan's export disease will increase with the delay of time, it will have an uncontrollable impact on other provinces in China and even the world. Our results suggest that the lockdown strategy adopted by Chinese government is right and timely which shows the responsibility of great power of China. Tian et al. presented a study on the effects of control strategies on COVID-19 transmission in Wuhan during the first 50 days from December 31, 2019, to February 19, 2020 [28] . They claimed that lockdown measure makes the people outside Wuhan to cope with the COVID-19 ahead of time. It is also announced that Fig. 10 Simulation results for the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases with different medical resources in Wuhan city. a The cumulative cases. b The newly cases more than 700,000 people outside Wuhan may be protected from the COVID-19 which demonstrated the effectiveness of control measures and thus are consistent with our findings in this work. It should be noted that the situations in the worldwide is becoming worse and worse. Here, we want to provide some suggesting for the control of COVID-19 spread. Firstly, from the individual level, we need to reconstruct the transmission path, trace back the transmission path of confirmed cases which are infected by COVID-19, find out the key nodes of transmission, and reveal the communication relationship between different individuals. Secondly, from the methodological aspect, it requires to integrate methods and theories from big data, networks science, epidemiology, mathematical model to predict the peak time, final size and so on. Lastly, from the control point of view, it needs to characterize the transmission probability between regions and the spatial-temporal aggregation within regions, show the spatial-temporal evolution process of COVID-19 in a visual form, and give quantitative indicators of high-risk and potential high-risk areas.

165472,"The data of air quality parameters i.e. PM 2.5 , NO 2 , SO 2 and CO were taken for four locations of Lucknow and ten locations of New Delhi for before lockdown (01/02/2020 to 21/02/2020) and after lockdown (25/03/2020 to 14/04/2020) periods (Tables S1A, B). The level of PM 2.5 varied from avg 48-369 μg/m 3 in four locations of Lucknow before lockdown. On 25th March, 2020, PM 2.5 level was the lowest 105 μg/m 3 at Gomti Nagar and highest 217 μg/m 3 at Talkatora. On 30th March 2020, PM 2.5 levels declined to 58 and 76 μg/m 3 , respectively in these areas while to 54 and 222 μg/ m 3 , respectively on 14th April, 2020 (Fig. 2a) . In New Delhi, the PM 2.5 level ranged from 85 to 456 μg/m 3 during before lockdown period in different locations. On 25th March, 2020 the range of PM 2.5 was 76 to 164 μg/m 3 and on 14th April, 2020, it was 47 to 204 μg/m 3 (Fig. 3a) . The range of NO 2 before and after lockdown period in Lucknow was 22-158 μg/m 3 and 3-59 μg/m 3 , respectively denoting a significant decline (Fig. 2b) . In New Delhi also, before and after lockdown levels of NO 2 were significantly different. Before lockdown, NO 2 ranged from 4 to 158 μg/ m 3 while after lockdown, it ranged from 9 to 112 μg/m 3 . The low value of 4 μg/m 3 in New Delhi before lockdown was from Indira Gandhi International Airport Terminal-3 ( Fig. 3b) . Thus, even before lockdown, some highly maintained and clean areas had low pollution levels. The levels of SO 2 , however, did not show much change before and after lockdown in both Lucknow and New Delhi (Figs. 2c,  3c) . The level of CO showed decline from 20-199 μg/m 3 to 3-55 μg/m 3 in Lucknow while from 15-150 μg/m 3 to 5-98 μg/m 3 in New Delhi (Figs. 2d, 3d) . The average and median (Fig S3) values of all these four parameters were also calculated for both the cities for before and after lockdown period (21 days Befor lock down After lock down Avg CO Fig. 3 a-d The effects of lockdown before and after PM 2.5 , NO 2 , SO 2 and CO level at Lucknow and Delhi city average value of PM 2.5 was 140.54 μg/m 3 (Gomti Nagar) and 65.09 μg/m 3 (Gomti Nagar) before and after lockdown, respectively in Lucknow. For New Delhi, the minimum average values of PM 2.5 were 225.63 μg/m 3 (North Campus, DU) and 43.18 μg/m 3 (North Campus, DU) before and after lockdown, respectively. In case of NO 2 the average value was 50.90 μg/m 3 (before) and 11.82 μg/m 3 (after) in Central School, Lucknow and 28.0 μg/m 3 (North Campus DU) and 4.36 μg/m 3 (IGI Airport) in New Delhi before and after lockdown, respectively. The minimum average value of SO 2 was found to be 7.18 μg/m 3 (Central School) and 4.18 μg/m 3 (Talkatora) in Lucknow before and after lockdown, respectively. The values of SO 2 were 9.90 μg/m 3 (Anand Vihar) and 6.0 μg/m 3 (Pusa) in New Delhi before and after lockdown, respectively. In case of CO, the minimum average value was 40.0 μg/m 3 (Gomati Nagar) and 35 μg/m 3 (Gomti Nagar) in Lucknow and 49.91 μg/m 3 (Pusa) and 17.18 μg/m 3 (Bawana) in New Delhi before and after lockdown, respectively. These 21 days average values of all four major air contaminants for before and after lockdown periods clearly indicate the significant reduction in the concentration of primary air pollutants. Hence, the trend analysis depicted a decline in air pollution indices in both the cities. However, some areas, like residential colonies, airport terminals and official localities, where the cleanliness is maintained in much better way and vehicular load is less, the pollution was found to be low even during normal phase. Hence, the minimum levels do not clearly indicate the extent of decline in overall pollution across the city during lockdown phase. PM 2.5 are submicron size particles, which affect health of people through congestion in lungs (Ma et al. 2017; Li et al. 2018) . NO 2 , SO 2 and CO affects human health severely and cause respiratory tract illness, asthma exacerbations and decreased lung function etc. (Harre et al. 1997; Oguntoke and Yussuf 2010) . However, even after the decline, the level of PM 2.5 remained higher than WHO recommended level of 10 μg/m 3 for the annual mean (WHO 2006) . Same is true for other parameters, whose WHO safe limits are 40 µg/m 3 (NO 2 ), 20 µg/ m 3 (SO 2 ) and 25 µg/m 3 (CO) for the annual mean Nonetheless, such a significant decline in air quality is supposed to lead to improved health of people and avoid air pollution linked health problems and even deaths. He et al. (2020) in a similar study on lockdown induced air pollution effects in China indicated that improvement in air quality might avoid 24,000 to 36,000 premature deaths on a monthly basis. However, they suggested that if indoor air quality becomes toxic during lockdown, it might reduce the presumed benefits (He et al. 2020) . The exact benefits of current air pollution decline would come to knowledge in due course of time. Presently, however, it is well clear that reduced human activities have created a much clear and clean air. The AQI was also calculated for 14 locations for before and after lockdown in two cities (Fig. 4) . The AQI of Lucknow was found to be in the range of 115.80 to 199.50 and remained in the unhealthy moderately polluted to poor range (AQI between 101 and 200) as described in the NAQI (Table S2 ). After the implication of lockdown, the AQI was significantly changed and was found to be in the range of 46.64 to 93.11 which falls in Good (0-50 at Central School Fig. 4 Air Quality Index in Lucknow and Delhi city (Before and After Lockdown). AQI were calculated using PM 2.5 , SO 2 and NO 2 and Gomti Nagar) to satisfactory (51-100 Lalbagh and Talkatora) AQI range. In New Delhi, the AQI was found to be poor at Bawana, CRRI Mathura Road and Dwarka-sector 8, as well as at some other monitoring site such as Anand Vihar, IGI airport (T3), North Campus Delhi University (DU), Pusa, Rohini, VivekVihar and Wazipur with the values (137-210) being in moderately polluted to poor AQI range (101 to 200) before the implication of lockdown. However, a dramatic reduction was observed in the AQI at all ten monitoring sites over Delhi with AQI range of 31.07 to 75.50 after lockdown. Thus, AQI values after lockdown fell in the range of good to satisfactory. The drastic change observed AQI values were mainly due to cut down in local anthropogenic emission sources such as industrial units, vehicular movements, transportation, and construction work, etc. To understand the influence of long-range transportation of atmospheric pollutants at both monitoring zones, the air mass back trajectory analysis was also performed. Air mass trajectories for four locations in Lucknow and ten locations in Delhi were very close to each other and so locations were considered as a single location in both cities. The mass concentration of PM 2.5 , SO 2 , NO 2 and CO showed significant fluctuation during before lockdown and after lockdown periods (Fig. 5a, b) . The air mass travelled from European, African, and Gulf countries as well Afghanistan, Tajikistan, Western Pakistan via Rajasthan, Punjab to Delhi and then to Lucknow during both events. However, few trajectories also originated from the Arabian Sea and the Gujrat state of India in case of Lucknow. In New Delhi, significant contribution was also noticed from local emission entities located in National Capital Region (NCR). So the air quality in both cities was dominantly influenced by long-range transportation, which also contributed to variation in the pollutant load. Air back mass trajectory has been well documented and examined by Tiwari et al. (2016) and Yerramsetti et al. (2013) for ambient air of Delhi and Lucknow, respectively. In conclusion, results of the present study indicate a sharp decline in overall air quality indexes and in the concentration of primary air pollutants. The study needs to be extended to analysis of secondary air pollutants, such as ozone, also. However, such a lockdown cannot be planned in normal conditions in such a huge country and therefore it cannot be considered as a permanent solution. Nevertheless, taking lessons from the present lockdown and emerging and foreseen environmental scenarios, we propose following prospective measures that can be adopted in future to mitigate air pollution. 1. In every 3 to 6 months, a short 3 to 5 days complete/partial lockdown can be practiced to mitigate environmental pollution especially air pollution. During such a lockdown, people should be encouraged to have regular walk and jogging in nearby areas without vehicular use. In this way, people would not only avoid continuous indoor air and mental stress of lockdown but would also enjoy outside clean air. 2. Weekly or fortnightly, one ""no vehicle day"" can be practiced.

165517,"The thin antimicrobial/virucidal silver nanocluster/silica composite coating (less than 200 nm) was deposited on a disposable facial FFP3 mask in non-woven fabric as shown in Figure 1 . The coating, made of silver nanoclusters well embedded in a glass matrix, presents the typical morphology visible in Figure 2 (Ag3W coated mask), as already observed in our previous works [4, 8] . The EDS analysis (Fig.2 a) confirmed the presence of silica and silver after deposition in terms of %at., with higher amount of silver nanoclusters in the coating Ag5W. The uncoated mask is predominantly composed of C and O with trace of some elements (Ti, Si, Na, Cl). The preliminary tests towards SARS-CoV-2 on a coated facial FFP3 mask proved interesting virucidal effect. In the first experiment, the inoculum remained completely over the uncoated mask, while it was absorbed by the coated mask without drying. In the second experiment, the uncoated mask maintained a visible inoculum even if reduced, while it dried in the coated mask. The results of the two types of experiments are reported in Table 1 . The reported titres are associated to the variation of the cytopathic effect within the same dilution (from 2+ to 4+). For both experiments, the higher infectivity is present in the uncoated facial mask and in the control, while the coated mask reduced the infectivity of one order of magnitude with the coating containing a lower silver concentration (Ag3W), and completely removed the cytopathic effect with coating containing a higher silver concentration (Ag5W).  In conclusion, it was demonstrated that the silver nanocluster / silica composite coating deposited on facial masks possessed virucidal effect. This coating is able to completely reduce the titre of SARS-CoV-2 to zero in the conditions described here. As already reported, this coating can be deposited on practically every kind of filtering media and also on metallic, ceramic, polymeric and glasses surfaces. It can hence provide an effective contribution to safety of crowded areas like supermarkets, productions sites, schools, hospitals, etc, where surfaces are exposed to many contacts with body parts each day. It can increase the working life of filtering masks and filtering media, also reducing the waste production related to their disposal.  "

Particulate matter concentration above 100 is harmful for human health (WHO 2006) . Inhaling fine dust particles for long time often creates different respiratory diseases and also invite deaths (WHO 2006; WHO 2016; WHO 2018) . Around 29% of lung cancer deaths, 24% stroke deaths, 25% cardiac disease death and 43% other lung disease are reported to be causing air pollution (Wu et al., 2020) . Also, air pollution caused 26% deaths from respiratory illness, 25% deaths from COPD and some 17% deaths from ischemic heart and stroke (WHO 2020) . At this point, it should be noted that for those with chronic respiratory and cardiovascular disorders, the COVID-19 death rate is significantly higher. Such diseases are also related to air pollution, which means air pollution can be seen as a secondary factor in these deaths Travaglio et al., 2020) . Past studies have verified the effect of air pollution on the health conditions. Several studies have shown that air pollution exposure has that health risks linked with respiratory, cardiovascular, pulmonary and other results related to health in the past decades, creating significant interest in air pollution (Karimzadegan et al., 2008; Xing et al., 2016; Isaifan, 2020; Peshave and Peshave, 2020) . In their previous studies, Pal and Mandal (2019) showed how the stone quarrying and crushing process is adding dust particles to the air day after day. They have estimated aerosol concentration from the region from 2014 to 2017 in season-wise at lower atmosphere. The average PM 10 value in summer season was 183.24 and winter PM 10 value was 224.33. So it is important to say that the PM 10 value is always very high in this area. But temporary closure of quarrying and crushing units has reduced this level significantly and it is good for human health. The people is already affected by PM related diseases may get temporary relief. Due to continuous release of heat from the crusher machine, temperature also found high in the industrial area (Pal and Mandal, 2017; Mandal, 2019a, Pal and Mandal, 2019b; Geissbühler et al., 2016) . This result although is associated with a regional scale study but a few study already done by Saadat et al, (2020) Lockdown condition has recorded about 3-5ºC temperature less than pre lockdown period indicating the fact that industry induced energy footprint enhances temperature significantly. Due to non operational state the noise level is ambient and found suitable for human health. River water quality is improved significantly amid lockdown. Usually huge amount of dust admixing with drainage debouches to nearby river and change the normal water quality parameters like total dissolved solid, temperature, pH, turbidity, dissolved oxygen etc (Pal and Mandal, 2019b) . As no such admixing is taking place amid lockdown, since water quality is improved. CBCB (2020) reported same incidents of water quality improvement in river Ganga, Yamuna amid lockdown situation. However this incident clearly pointed out a way through which we can combat pollution of different environmental components and human health. Temporary lockdown can improve the quality of environment. It may hamper the economy but if we think about sustainable J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f economy, sustainable economy in co-existence with ambient environment it is the only way. Worldwide lock down has provided a good opportunity to realize the our pressure on nature and patience of nature. However successful control of pollution sources can give a lively earth and it can establish the right to life in our planet earth. J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f interventions and effects of a historic national lockdown in India's response to the COVID-19 pandemic: data science call to arms. medRxiv. . 1101/2020.04.15.20067256 Saadat, S., Rawtani, D., Hussain, C.M., 2020.

167220,"In this study, the influences of emission reductions due to reduced anthropogenic activities during the COVID-19 outbreak in China on air pollution were investigated. It is concluded that anthropogenic emission decreases, mainly on transportation and industry, contributed to the decreases of PM 2.5 concentrations. The decreases of PM 2.5 in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Wuhan were 9.23, 6.37, 5.35, and 30.79 μg/m 3 , respectively. However, this is not enough to avoid severe air pollution events in most areas. The reduction ratios of PM 2.5 concentrations were smaller than the reduction ratios of precursor emissions, partially due to the unfavorable meteorological conditions. This study highlights the importance of understanding the role of chemistry and meteorology in designing emission control strategies.  "
