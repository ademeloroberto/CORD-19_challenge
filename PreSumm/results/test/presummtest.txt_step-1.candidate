In this paper, we have used timeseries data from the Johns Hopkins University Coronavirus Resource Center on the cumulative number of confirmed cases and deaths due to COVID-19 to build a data-driven model of infection dynamics under social distancing.<q>We find that the COVID-19 pandemic in all regions with sufficient data can be described by a universal curve where the cumula-tive numbers of both infections and deaths quickly cross over from exponential growth at early times to a longer period of power law growth, before eventually slowing.<q>In agreement with a recent statistical forecasting model by the IHME, we show that this dynamics is well described by the cumulative distribution function of the normal distribution.
