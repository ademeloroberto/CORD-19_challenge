We aimed to discover critical insights on the endemic/epidemic/pandemic characteristics of the While TPL-b appears rather stable or even invariant with time and/or space, the population aggregation critical density (PACD) (i.<q>Therefore, M 0 can be an important epidemiological parameter for evaluating the characteristics of disease outbreaks.<q>e., M 0 or infection critical threshold), which is the level at which infections are random and below which infections may be stabilized, can depend on disease kinds (COVID-19 or SARS), time (disease or outbreak stages), and space (regions).
