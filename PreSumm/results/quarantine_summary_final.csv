23607,"Her pharyngeal symptoms disappeared gradually and her body temperature remained normal, without any symptoms of coughing or chest tightness. Chest CT on 22nd February showed that the lesion in the right lower lobe was smaller than before ( Figure 1C ). The patient was then discharged from the hospital on 25th February 2020. The patient and her parents had no epidemiological history in Wuhan city or Hubei province. The patient may be a third-or fourth-generation infected person, suggesting that in early February, more than three generations of SARS-CoV-2 have been transmitted in areas outside of Wuhan and Hubei. Modern transportation has made personnel movements more rapid, which might have accelerated the virus transmission speed [6] . The patient's mother had fever before her death, and her father went to two hospitals due to his fever before the diagnosis. Neither of them had the SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid test. If the patient's parents and the attending medical staff were not effectively protected at the time, further transmission may have occurred. Therefore, the vigilance of medical staff in outpatient and emergency departments around patients with fever and respiratory symptoms should be further improved and comprehensive SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid testing should be performed on such patients [7] . This is a typical case of a family cluster onset, which is common in many other cases [8] . During the epidemic period, although the father who initially developed the disease had no clear history of contact, he had stayed in multiple hospitals. Owing to the complexity of pathogen sources in hospitals, there may be potential sources of COVID-19 infection. This suggests that during the epidemic, hospital stay should be minimized. If there are feverish cases in the family, effective isolation measures should be implemented as early as possible to minimize the spread of the virus. This patient's nucleic acid test for respiratory pathogens has been negative on two consecutive occasions (sampling interval of at least 24 h). According to the Chinese 'Seventh Edition of the COVID-19 Diagnosis and Treatment Protocol' [5] , she had already met the standards of releasing from quarantine and discharging from hospital. However, a fourth subsequent respiratory tract sample showed positive SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid. Usually, nucleic acid positive rate is 80-83% [9, 10] , which suggests that in patients with a clear epidemiological history of contact with COVID-19 or suspected patients from a family cluster, the quarantine period should be appropriately extended and the nucleic acid tests should be performed repeatedly to avoid accidental discharge which may cause further virus spread. The patient's nucleic acid only became positive on the 7th day of admission. This may be because of the patient's low viral load and mild symptoms, or simply the sampling site. It is reported in the literature that taking sputum sample from a deep spot in the lung may increase the positive rate [11] . But clinically, many patients have a dry cough without any sputum, which makes it more difficult to retain sputum samples. This could be one of the reasons for the low nucleic acid positive rate. Therefore, for patients who are highly suspected for COVID-19 but with negative nucleic acid, repeated testing should be performed. In case of persistent negativity, sampling of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid should be considered. Other testing methods, such as blood IgM, second-generation sequencing may also be used to achieve confirmed diagnosis. Test results: it is reported that SARS-CoV-2 may cause a decrease in peripheral white blood cell and lymphocyte counts in the early stages of the disease [5] . But this is not the case in this patient. Some patients may have elevated liver enzymes and creatase, increased erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein. This patient had slightly increased creatase and elevated C-reactive protein, which is consistent with the report. A transient increase in serum amyloid A in this patient suggests that serum amyloid A may also be a sensitive indicator of COVID-19. For suspected cases with history of close contact with COVID-19 patients, respiratory SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid should be tested repeatedly to avoid missed diagnosis. • For suspected cases with a history of close contact with COVID-19 patients, SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid should be tested repeatedly to avoid missed diagnosis.

25734,"This case highlights the infectivity of the virus through pre-symptomatic people. COVID-19 has globally impacted social and economic life, but the loss of life is irreplaceable and irreparable. A certain set of precautions and vigilance including hand hygiene, PPE, avoiding unnecessary travel, quarantine and self-isolation are the most critical steps in containing this pandemic illness from getting out of control. India is a nation of 1.3 billion people, densely populated, and resource constrained. If we face an outbreak of the same ferocity as China, Italy or Spain, our healthcare resources would be overrun a lot sooner. The mere thought of the consequences is petrifying. Our only saving gracewe are probably in the initial phases of the epidemic. 10, 11 Until this stage, the authorities are largely able to keep track and quarantine the cases and their contacts. But beyond this, it becomes impossible. This is our final defence, our ultimate stand. Any further, and we may reach a tipping point of our reserves. Healthcare and economic collapse would be inevitable. So, the buck stops with strict self-isolation and quarantine. The screening of passengers at International airports in India was started from 18 January 2020 12 and more than 1.5 million passengers have since arrived in India. 13 The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare along with state health authorities has made a detailed list of these passengers and have embarked on an extensive tracking of these passengers to ensure quarantine and isolation as per incubation-period recommendations. 14 The adequacy of contact tracing will be crucial determinant towards the control of this corona virus disease. However, due to high proportion of pre-symptomatic having potential to promulgate secondary and tertiary transmissions, timely contact tracing may not be feasible especially due to the known delays of reporting and laboratory test results. Thus, contact tracing may only have a supplementary role to other restrictive strategies like social distancing and avoidance of unnecessary social contact through administrative measures like lockdown.  Understanding the disease epidemiology is a first step in response preparedness. COVID-19 has a risk of unprecedented spread especially by means of pre-symptomatic transmission. Contact tracing, timely testing and adequate quarantine/isolation will go a long way in reigning the rapid spread of this disease.

25757,"In this paper, a new Susceptible-Exposed-Symptomatic Infectious-Asymptomatic Infectious-Quarantined-Hospitalized-Recovered-Dead (SEI(D)I(U)QHRD) deterministic compartmental model has been proposed and calibrated for interpreting the transmission dynamics of the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19). The purpose of this study is to give a tentative prediction of the epidemic peak for Russia, Brazil, India and Bangladesh which could become the next COVID-19 hotspots in no time by using a Trust-region-reflective (TRR) algorithm which one of the well-known real data fitting techniques. Based on the publicly available epidemiological data from late January until 10 May, it has been estimated that the number of daily new symptomatic infectious cases for the above mentioned countries could reach the peak around the beginning of June with the peak size of ∼ 15, 774 (95% CI, 12,814-16,734) symptomatic infectious cases in Russia, ∼ 26, 449 (95% CI, 25,489-31,409) cases in Brazil, ∼ 9, 504 (95% CI, 8,378-13,630) cases in India and ∼ 2, 209 (95% CI, 2,078-2,840) cases in Bangladesh. As of May 11, 2020, incorporating the infectiousness capability of asymptomatic carriers, our analysis estimates the value of the basic reproduction number (R(0)) as of May 11, 2020 was found to be ∼ 4.234 (95% CI, 3.764-4.7) in Russia, ∼ 5.347 (95% CI, 4.737-5.95) in Brazil, ∼ 5.218 (95% CI, 4.56-5.81)in India, ∼ 4.649 (95% CI, 4.17-5.12) in the United Kingdom and ∼ 3.53 (95% CI, 3.12-3.94) in Bangladesh. Moreover, Latin hypercube sampling-partial rank correlation coefficient (LHS-PRCC) which is a global sensitivity analysis (GSA) method is applied to quantify the uncertainty of our model mechanisms, which elucidates that for Russia, the recovery rate of undetected asymptomatic carriers, the rate of getting home-quarantined or self-quarantined and the transition rate from quarantined class to susceptible class are the most influential parameters, whereas the rate of getting home-quarantined or self-quarantined and the inverse of the COVID-19 incubation period are highly sensitive parameters in Brazil, India, Bangladesh and the United Kingdom which could significantly affect the transmission dynamics of the novel coronavirus. Our analysis also suggests that relaxing social distancing restrictions too quickly could exacerbate the epidemic outbreak in the above-mentioned countries.","In this paper, a new Susceptible-Exposed-Symptomatic Infectious-Asymptomatic Infectious-Quarantined-Hospitalized-Recovered-Dead (SEI(D)I(U)QHRD) deterministic compartmental model has been proposed and calibrated for interpreting the transmission dynamics of the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19).<q>The purpose of this study is to give a tentative prediction of the epidemic peak for Russia, Brazil, India and Bangladesh which could become the next COVID-19 hotspots in no time by using a Trust-region-reflective (TRR) algorithm which one of the well-known real data fitting techniques.<q>Based on the publicly available epidemiological data from late January until 10 May, it has been estimated that the number of daily new symptomatic infectious cases for the above mentioned countries could reach the peak around the beginning of June with the peak size of ∼ 15, 774 (95% CI, 12,814-16,734) symptomatic infectious cases in Russia, ∼ 26, 449 (95% CI, 25,489-31,409) cases in Brazil, ∼ 9, 504 (95% CI, 8,378-13,630) cases in India and ∼ 2, 209 (95% CI, 2,078-2,840) cases in Bangladesh.

64144,"While previous authors [1] [6] have alluded to and explored the use of age targeting, they have done so in the limited sense of quarantining retirees, and assumed moderate social distancing measures are implemented. Here we argue that this undersells the potential effectiveness of the targeted quarantine approach; any government willing to take the extraordinary measure of shutting down all of society should, at the very least, consider the significantly less drastic measure of quarantining one third of their population. To the low risk population, our strategy offers a fast return to functional society, and, for those few who do get sick, access to medical facilities and staff who are dealing with a manageable number of cases. To those under isolation, targeted quarantine offers the possibility of avoiding COVID-19 altogether. By releasing a large portion of the population from lockdown after a small number of weeks, age-targeted quarantine balances the need to maintain a functional society and economy, with the limitations of hospital resources, and has the potential to significantly reduce casualties.

We found that population-weighted density (PWD), as well as metrics for the efficacy of lock-down orders were the most significant explanatory variables in explaining the variability in the rate of deaths across U.S. states. Race/ethnicity, health, and climate effects, while statistically significant, were not as significantly important. This may reflect an intrinsic truth, or, more, more likely, is a consequence of the limitations in the data collected. Further studies with more extensive and accurate datasets (as they become available) will likely resolve these issues.

64248,"There is strong interest globally amidst the current COVID-19 pandemic in tracing contacts of infectious patients using mobile technologies, both as a warning system to individuals and as a targeted intervention strategy for governments. Several governments, including India, have introduced mobile apps for this purpose, which give a warning when the individual's phone establishes bluetooth contact with the phone of an infected person. We present a methodology to probabilistically evaluate risk of infection given the network of contacts that individuals are likely to encounter in real life. Instead of binary ""infected"" or ""uninfected"" statuses, an infection risk probability is maintained which can be efficiently calculated based on probabilities of recent contacts, and updated when a recent contact is diagnosed with a disease. We demonstrate on realistic networks that this method sharply outperforms a naive immediate-contact method even in an ideal circumstance that all infected persons are known to the naive method. We demonstrate robustness to missing contact information (such as when phones fail to make bluetooth contact or the app is not installed). We show, within our model, a strong flattening of the infectious peak when even a small fraction of cases are identified, tested and isolated. In the real world, where most known-infected persons are isolated or quarantined and where many individuals may not carry their mobiles in public, we believe the improvement offered by our method warrants consideration. Importantly, in view of widespread concerns on privacy and contact-tracing, our method relies mainly on direct contact data that can be stored locally on users' phones, and uses limited communication via intermediary servers only upon testing, mitigating privacy concerns.","There is strong interest globally amidst the current COVID-19 pandemic in tracing contacts of infectious patients using mobile technologies, both as a warning system to individuals and as a targeted intervention strategy for governments.<q>Several governments, including India, have introduced mobile apps for this purpose, which give a warning when the individual's phone establishes bluetooth contact with the phone of an infected person.<q>We present a methodology to probabilistically evaluate risk of infection given the network of contacts that individuals are likely to encounter in real life.

64358,"The rapid expansion of COVID-19 has caused a global pandemic. Although quarantine measures have been used widely, the critical steps among them to suppress the outbreak without a huge social-economic loss remain unknown. Hong Kong, unlike other regions in the world, had a massive number of travellers from Mainland China during the early expansion period, and yet the spread of virus has been relatively limited. Understanding the effect of control measures to reduce the transmission in Hong Kong can improve the control of the virus spreading. We have developed a susceptible-exposed-infectious-quarantined-recovered (SEIQR) meta-population model that can stratify the infections into imported and subsequent local infections, and therefore to obtain the control effects on transmissibility in a region with many imported cases. We fitted the model to both imported and local confirmed cases with symptom onset from 18 January to 29 February 2020 in Hong Kong with daily transportation data and the transmission dynamics from Wuhan and Mainland China. The model estimated that the reproductive number was dropped from 2.32 to 0.76 (95% CI, 0.66 to 0.86) after an infected case was estimated to be quarantined half day before the symptom onset, corresponding to the incubation time of 5.43 days (95% CI, 1.30-9.47). If the quarantine happened about one day after the onset, community spread would be likely to occur, indicated by the reproductive number larger than one. The results suggest that the early quarantine for a suspected case before the symptom onset is a key factor to suppress COVID-19.","Although quarantine measures have been used widely, the critical steps among them to suppress the outbreak without a huge social-economic loss remain unknown.<q>The rapid expansion of COVID-19 has caused a global pandemic.<q>Hong Kong, unlike other regions in the world, had a massive number of travellers from Mainland China during the early expansion period, and yet the spread of virus has been relatively limited.

64390,"The Italian population is receiving public health messaging, understands it, and most -save for small numbers of young people and skeptics -claim to be following it closely. Those who take it seriously defect for mostly universally recognized acceptable reasons (e.g., groceries, medicine). New messaging campaigns designed to accomplish the same purpose should not be the focus at this point. However, the negative psychological effects of the quarantine -most commonly boredom, perceived immobility, and anxiety -are beginning to wear on people and seem likely to become more serious over 13 .

If we expect the Italian people to remain inside and keep following the recommendations of public health officials for the next few weeks or even months (as may be necessary to curb the spread of COVID-19) it would be helpful to find ways of reducing these negative effects of the quarantine. A messaging campaign that suggests how to make the quarantine easier and more frictionless, rather than repeating the now well-known dire reasons to stay indoors, should begin. Possibilities include messaging about online collective exercises, social reading activities (e.g., Perusall.com for schools and universities), safe ways for people to get fresh air outside, classes (e.g., edx.org for online classes), or novel ways of bridging social capital between young and old, or even distribution of inexpensive tablets or laptops to ensure the whole population has video conferencing abilities. If we look for activities and interventions that make the quarantine easier for those affected by it, the population may be able to better tolerate the treatment for as long as it takes to overcome this public health crisis. respondent of an intensely personal impact of non-compliance with the quarantine. The message was as follows: ""If you are infected with COVID-19, you are likely to infect your parents, your friends' parents, and/or one any one of your close ones. If they are older than 50, they may die. In the text field below, please name a loved one (example: my father, my grandmother) that you're most worried about contracting COVID-19."" The third group received no message, as a control condition for comparison. In a pre-test, the social externalities messaging outperformed most other messages framing the risks of noncompliance with safety measures -including messages framed around pro-sociality, expert or celebrity advice, and healthcare sector externalities (i.e. ""flatten the curve""). The survey proceeded by then asking respondents for their beliefs, social perceptions, and perceived efficacy about government and/or public safety measures. Respondents were also asked about their trust in government and the degree to which the government was providing factual information about the crisis. We asked respondents a series of questions about anxiety, stress, and worry around the current circumstances. Next, respondents were asked about their future behaviors -namely whether they planned to leave the house in the next 5 days, and their top reasons for leaving, as well as negative aspects of complying with staying at home. Finally, respondents took a brief personality battery, provided personal demographic information, and were asked whether they would share either the social externalities message or some other message of their choosing with upto 5 of their friends or loved ones via text or email.

64433,"Our work may help the authorities to quantify the lessons learned during the COVID-19 pandemic and utilize them during future epidemics (more generally, our methods may be applied to any kind of mass delivery and collection: e.g., the drones may distribute immunity tests to release people from quarantine). Indeed, one stumbling block to drones ubiquity is the generally absent regulation (in particular, in regions with less strict or absent (anti-)drone laws, UAVs are already widely used for medical applications including infectious disease surveillance and epidemiology [BMAN+14, CMRS+19, HMCMM17, GPHS+18]). With a proactive thinking, the authorities could design sets of regulations with different levels of strictness: in situations like epidemics, more lenient regulations could take force and let the drone operations rise to higher levels than during nominal course of events --the switch may be justified not only by the extreme social value of the drones use (as shown here), but also by the fact that during the (even partial) quarantine there are fewer people on the streets, which lowers the ground risk of drone operations (one of the concerns for the regulators [AHH19, BNEK+17, BNAB+17, DPJ18, PRC20, WCS17]). We emphasize that our model of mass-testing can be applied at any geographic scale. In particular, while the epidemic is confined to a limited area, it may be reasonable to concentrate on mass-testing only the potentially affected region. As far as our theoretical results (SIQR) are concerned, incorporating people on quarantine into epidemic spread modeling may not only provide more accurate prediction of the disease spread, but also help understand the economic consequences of the quarantine (see [T20] for discussion of COVID-19 economic impact).

64468,"Our estimates of SAR, SI, and asymptomatic infection demonstrate the challenges in controlling SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Based on our pooled estimates of these three parameters, 10 infected symptomatic persons living with 100 contacts would result in 15 additional symptomatic infected persons in <5 days and 39 in <15 days. If the testing and tracing strategy is based on symptoms, we would further miss 25% of infected individuals, who are asymptomatic and could potentially be transmitting. Overall, these findings suggest that aggressive contact-tracing strategies based on suspect cases may be appropriate early in an outbreak but as it progresses, control measures should transition to a combination of approaches that account for setting-specific transmission risk. Quarantine may need to cover entire communities such as dormitories, workplaces, or other institutional and residential settings, while contact tracing should shift to identifying hotspots of transmission and vulnerable populations. The variability in SAR across settings suggests targeted strategies may allow for reducing infections while not overly restricting social movement. . CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0    .

64475,"We here present the performance characteristics of a novel ELISA and nine LFIA devices for detecting SARS-COV-2 IgM and IgG using a panel of reference plasma. After setting thresholds for detection using 50 negative (pre-pandemic) controls, 85% of 40 RT-PCR-confirmed positive patients had IgG detected by ELISA, including 100% patients tested ≥10 days after symptom onset. A panel of LFIA devices had sensitivity between 55 and 70% against the referencestandard RT-PCRs, or 65-85% against ELISA, with specificity of 95-100% and 93-100% respectively. These estimates come with relatively wide confidence intervals due to constraints on the number of devices made available for testing. Nevertheless, this study provides a benchmark against which to further assess the performance of platforms to detect anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM/IgG, with the aim of guiding decisions about deploying antibody testing and informing the design and assessment of second-generation assays. LFIA devices are cheap to manufacture, store and distribute, and could be used as a point-ofcare test by healthcare practitioners or individuals at home, offering an appealing approach to diagnostics and evaluating individual and population-level exposure.

Based on the transmission mechanisms and physicochemical properties of betacoronaviruses, we construct a fine-grained transmission dynamics model (ICRD) to forecast the crucial information of public concern, therein using dynamical coefficients to quantify the impact of the implement time and intensity of containment policies on the spread of epidemic. We find that the comprehensive investigation policy for susceptible population and the quarantine for suspected cases eminently contribute to reduce casualties during the phase of the dramatic increase of diagnosed cases. Statistic evidences strongly suggest that society should take such forceful public health interventions to cut the infection channels in the initial stage until the pandemic is interrupted.","The outbreak of COVID-19 since Dec.<q>We find that the comprehensive investigation policy for susceptible population and the quarantine for suspected cases eminently contribute to reduce casualties during the phase of the dramatic increase of diagnosed cases.<q>Statistic evidences strongly suggest that society should take such forceful public health interventions to cut the infection channels in the initial stage until the pandemic is interrupted.

64616,"The outbreak of the novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) has lead countries worldwide to administer quarantine policies. However, each country or state decides independently what mobility restrictions to administer within its borders, while aiming to maximize its own citizens' welfare. In turn, since individuals travel between countries and states, at least during periods when quarantines are less restrictive, the policy in one country may ultimately affect the infection level in other countries. Therefore, major questions are whether the policy dictated by a decentralized government is efficient, and if not, how the governments can coordinate a better policy. Here, we focus on the decision regarding the timing of releasing the quarantines. We consider a game theory model in which each of two governments decides when to switch from a restrictive to a non-restrictive quarantine and vice versa. We used parameter values driven by the literature and publically available data. We show that, if travel is sufficiently frequent during the non-restrictive quarantine periods, then the strategies are sub-optimal: Each governor tends to release the quarantine sooner, which ultimately leads to longer periods of restrictive quarantines and a higher prevalence of the disease. In turn, if the governments restrict international and interstate travel to a low level even when the quarantines are non-restrictive, the policy dictated by the decentralized governance may become optimal.","The outbreak of the novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) has lead countries worldwide to administer quarantine policies.<q>However, each country or state decides independently what mobility restrictions to administer within its borders, while aiming to maximize its own citizens' welfare.<q>Here, we focus on the decision regarding the timing of releasing the quarantines.

64665,"Due to the closed environment and close contact among people on board, cruise ships can be vulnerable to outbreak of infectious diseases [14] . Our estimates of R0 for the initial period (Table 1 ) are all greater than 3, consistent with most estimates of R0 reported earlier [22, 23] , showing that the COVID-19 virus is highly transmissible. Our results show that with a serial interval of 6 days, R0 is similar for t = 1-3, yet R0 for some passengers is slightly higher for t = 4, while R0 finally decreases for t = 5. This demonstrates the possibility that as long as asymptomatic positive cases were not removed, R0 remains high under quarantine conditions. We find evidence to support a CDC report that ""a high proportion of asymptomatic infections could partially explain the high attack rate among cruise ship passengers and crew."" The effects of pre/asymptomatic population on the spread of COVID-19 during quarantine has not yet been studied extensively. Clinical observations and lab tests have confirmed the existence of a pre/asymptomatic population infecting others [6, 7, 8] . It is not easy to give precise estimates of the size of this population, yet the DP outbreak provides very useful real world data for this. 46.5% of passengers and crew members on the DP were asymptomatic at the time of testing [14] , and about 17.9% of the infected individuals never demonstrated any symptoms [13] . Some research has suggested that the pre/asymptomatic population, ""silent carriers,"" are the main driving force behind this pandemic. A group has estimated that the proportion of undocumented infections in China -including those who experience mild, limited or no symptoms and go undiagnosed-could be as high as 86% prior to January 23, 2020.

CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0    In this paper, we have given a detailed description of how a multilevel integrated model for the spread of COVID-19 is built using a systems approach. We designed the system by keeping the real world view in perspective at all times. Daily in-person interactions were split into three layers, namely family, workplace, and public places. These interactions form the basis of person-to-person virus transmission. Every day was built as a computational block connected to other layers through the silent carriers coming out of the block. Each day comprises of many layers of computation blocks. A complex network of the virus spread was built block-by-block and layer-by-layer. The multiple layers were integrated to give a complete system view. All parameters have physical significance in the real world. .

Besides these, there is complete flexibility in changing other parameters, if there is empirical evidence. In this paper, we have shown the models' effectiveness in simulating COVID-19. However, MIMANSA is an inherently generic model to simulate the virus spread. It is flexible and can be easily adapted to other spread of viruses. MIMANSA was trained using COIVD-19 case data from India. Once trained, it has been able to track the number of patient cases within 5% error margin. However, the objective of MIMNASA is not only predicting the cases but to help make complex decisions with ease. MIMANSA allows one to simulate various percentages of lockdown, assess the effectiveness of masks usage, contact tracing, and quarantine. One can run multiple scenarios with varying levels of each of the parameters to find out a trade-off between a high number of patients with a minimal impact on the economy vs. a low number of cases with a high impact on the economy. With the help of MIMANSA, our current research aims at finding the balance between the effect of strict lockdown on the economy vs. the marginally high number of COVID-19 patients with a bit relaxed lockdown.

64840,"The key parameter that characterizes the transmissibility of a disease is the reproduction number R. If it exceeds 1, the number of incident cases will inevitably grow over time, and a large epidemic is possible. To prevent the expansion of an epidemic, R must be reduced to a level below 1. To estimate the reproduction number, the probability distribution function of the generation interval of an infectious disease is required to be available; however, this distribution is often unknown. In this letter, given the incomplete information for the generation interval, we propose a maximum entropy method to estimate the reproduction number. Based on this method, given the mean value and variance of the generation interval, we first determine its probability distribution function and in turn estimate the real-time values of reproduction number of COVID-19 in China. By applying these estimated reproduction numbers into the susceptible-infectious-removed epidemic model, we simulate the evolutionary track of the epidemic in China, which is well in accordance with that of the real incident cases. The simulation results predict that China's epidemic will gradually tend to disappear by May 2020 if the quarantine measures can continue to be executed.","The key parameter that characterizes the transmissibility of a disease is the reproduction number R.<q>Based on this method, given the mean value and variance of the generation interval, we first determine its probability distribution function and in turn estimate the real-time values of reproduction number of COVID-19 in China.<q>If it exceeds 1, the number of incident cases will inevitably grow over time, and a large epidemic is possible.

64846,"By pooling individual data from seven countries, we estimated the mean incubation period of COVID-19 to be 7.44 days, latent period 2.52 days, serial interval 6.70 days, time point of   perpetuity. preprint ()  [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] There are several possible reasons for the difference. First, the sample size is generally small in previous studies, 2, 4, 6, 7, [9] [10] [11] [12] but much larger in the present one. Second, most cases in previous studies had a long or even unclear interval of exposure, making it difficult to determine the exact exposure date 3, 5, 13 and giving rise to error. By contrast, this study followed strict inclusion criteria regarding exposure period and method to determine exposure date to ensure the potential error in the estimates be small (< 0.3 day, according to the sensitivity analysis). Third, the approaches to determination of transmission order within clusters are different. For the cases involving cluster infection, which represent the majority of all cases, a common practice of previous studies was to take the case with earliest date of symptom onset as infector and others as infectee. 9 However, we deemed it inappropriate in view of the varying incubation periods of individuals and potential pre-symptomatic or asymptomatic transmission. In this study, more rigorous criteria were applied to the inclusion of clusters, and the clusters in which transmission order was uncertain were excluded from relevant analyses. Fourth, different studies used data from different stages of the epidemic. The data of this study was retrieved through late February of 2020, which may reflect more of the situation after strong measures were taken to battle the epidemic in China. Our finding that the incubation period was within 14 days for 93% of the cases lends support to current practice of 14-day quarantine of persons with potential exposure to SARS-CoV-2. In line with other studies, 13 we also found some cases who developed symptoms 14 days after exposure, indicating that longer quarantine periods might be justified for some people. However, as it is hard to know beforehand who will develop symptoms beyond 14 days of exposure, the cost of extending quarantine of many people and the potential consequence of failure to identify a few symptomatic cases must be weighed carefully. The negative values of serial interval and time point of exposure provide evidence of presymptomatic transmission, which are consistent with the much shorter latent period than incubation period. The percentages of negative serial interval (3.92%) and negative time point of exposure (43.78%) can be viewed as the lower and upper limits of probability of presymptomatic transmission, respectively. Asymptomatic transmission was also observed in this study (Table 3 ). These findings are in line with those of previous studies. 8,9,14-17 Stratified analysis in this study found a trend towards longer incubation period of less severe cases as compared with that of more severe cases. This implies that severe cases could be detected and 'removed' from the pool of transmission sources more quickly, while less severe cases would   perpetuity. preprint ()  . . 21.20040329  stay in the pool for a longer time and constitute a big challenge to the control of epidemic given the possibility of pre-symptomatic transmission. The R0 we estimated is smaller than those from previous estimates which were mostly between 2 and 4. 7,20,26-28 As discussed above, the difference may either be due to methodological issues in obtaining parameters or reflect different stages of epidemic. In any case, a smaller R0 should not be interpreted as low risk of transmission. Slow response of government, presymptomatic and asymptomatic transmission and insufficient protection measures taken by the public together could lead to an out-of-control epidemic, as with the current situation in many countries. This study has limitations. First, the cases were retrieved from publicly available reports, and many cases were excluded because there were no details available for estimating the parameters. Thus, the representativeness of cases could be a concern. A comparison of the age and sex of included cases with those of 72314 cases in China showed that they are generally similar. 29 Previous studies suggested that publicly reported cases may overrepresent the severe ones. However, based on 329 cases (28.48%) with relevant information available, non-severe cases appeared to account for a higher proportion in the present study than in the previous one on 72314 cases in China. The second limitation of this study is that the upper limit of latent period was based on only 11 pairs of infector-infectee. Larger studies are needed to obtain a more robust estimate. The third limitation is that by using the upper limit of latent period instead of the real latent period in formula (2), in our case, could lead to a slightly smaller value of R0. If we use a naively small value of the latent period at 0 days (i.e., no latency), the formula (2) would lead to a R0 at 1.67, which can be treated as the lower bound. Hence, under the formula (2), R0 may range from 1.67 to 1.78, which was consistent with those from formula (1), i.e., 1.71 (95% CI: 1.67, 1.75). In conclusion, this study obtained robust estimates of several key epidemiological parameters of COVID-19. It provides additional evidence on the mean incubation period of COVID-19, which supports current practice of 14-day quarantine of persons with potential exposure but also suggests that longer monitoring periods might be needed for selected groups. The estimates of serial interval, time point of exposure and latent period provide consistent evidence on pre-symptomatic transmission. Asymptomatic transmission was also observed. This together with asymptomatic transmission and the generally longer incubation and serial interval of less severe cases suggest a high risk of long-term epidemic in the absence of appropriate control measures.

64955,"The number of confirmed COVID -19 cases, relative to the population size, has varied greatly throughout the United States and, even, within the same city. In different zip codes in New York City, the epicenter of the epidemic, the number of cases per 100,000 residents has varied between 437 and 4227, i.e., in a 1:10 ratio. To guide policy decisions regarding containment and reopening of the economy, schools, and other institutions, it is vital to identify which factors drive this large variation. This paper reports on a statistical study of the incidence variation across New York City, conducted with data at zip code granularity. Among many socio-economical and demographic measures considered, the average household size emerges as the single most important explanatory variable: an increase of the average household size by one member accounts, in our final model specification, for at least 876 cases, a full 23% of the span of incidence numbers, at a 95% confidence level. The percentage of the population above the age of 65, as well as that below the poverty line, are additional indicators with a significant impact on the case incidence rate, along with their interaction term. Contrary to common belief, population density, per se, fails to have a significantly positive impact. Indeed, population densities and case incidence rates are negatively correlated, with a -33% correlation coefficient. Our model specification is anchored on a basic and established epidemiological model that explains the importance of household sizes on R0, the basic reproductive number of an epidemic. Our findings support implemented and proposed policies to quarantine pre-acute and post-acute patients, , as well as nursing home admission policies.","The number of confirmed COVID -19 cases, relative to the population size, has varied greatly throughout the United States and, even, within the same city.<q>In different zip codes in New York City, the epicenter of the epidemic, the number of cases per 100,000 residents has varied between 437 and 4227, i.<q>e., in a 1:10 ratio.

64973,"In this study, we compare how two distinct types of contact-based control strategies, contact tracing and large-scale lockdowns/self-quarantine or social distancing, impact the characteristics of single or sequential COVID-19 outbreaks. We find that contact tracing generally is less effective in decreasing outbreak size for rapidly spreading pathogens (high baseline re-15   ()   .   production number R 0,b ), unless the tracing is very efficient. On the other hand, widespread lockdowns/social distancing interventions can lower outbreak size inversely proportional to an increase in the rate of self-quarantine. Our analysis indicates that China benefited from the heavy influence of lockdowns by rapidly containing the quickly growing COVID-19 cases, and, despite massive efforts, contact tracing was less influential in bringing down the epidemic. Despite the difference in the targeted nature of contact tracing versus the more indiscriminate lockdown measures, we contend there is a similar reactive quality to both control strategies. Contact tracing reacts to reported cases by tracking and (to varying degrees) quarantining individuals whom have been contacted. Mass social distancing or self-quarantine reflects a natural response by both governments and individuals which intensifies as cases build, a phenomenon that has been labeled as ""exponential whiplash"" (15) . These features motivate us to construct a COVID-19 model with both contact tracing (mechanistically) and self-quarantine (phenomenologically) dependent on force of infection. In contrast to another model which assumes a linear rate of self-quarantine (6), the nonlinear social distancing rate captures a contagion-like behavioral response to infected cases, and allows us to derive novel formulae for final outbreak size. Furthermore the model provides a good simultaneous fit to both cumulative reported cases and daily quarantined contact data from China. An important distinction between contact tracing and lockdowns is their mode of action, namely preventing onward secondary infections by early tracking of likely infected cases in the former and large-scale depletion (or shielding) of susceptible individuals for the latter. This contrast determines how they affect the major epidemiological quantities of reproduction number and outbreak size in our ""transmission-reactive"" formulation. In particular, contact tracing proportionally reduces R 0 , akin to vaccination, leading to a nonlinear relationship with final outbreak size, which decreases substantially only as R 0 approaches one. The responsive selfquarantine rate does not affect R 0 , and we derive a simple inverse proportionality with outbreak 16   ()   .   size. Because the rate can be translated to a time of action for social distancing measures, this result analytically demonstrates the escalating impacts of delaying implementation of responsive lockdowns beyond a critical time period, which has been observed in other studies via simulation (16, 17) . Even though similar levels of self-quarantine would eventually be reached in our model as incidence grows, the cost of delays can result in a large excess of cases. Although we find that the extensive lockdowns and social distancing was a much larger factor in controlling COVID-19 outbreak size in China, our sensitivity analysis shows that contact tracing did dampen and delay peak number of infected despite its more limited impact on the cumulative count. In this way, contact tracing can flatten the incidence curve, easing the strain on limited hospital resources. A combination of expediently enacted contact-based interventions may be the best strategy, where effective contact tracing and responsive social distancing measures can synergistically and efficiently suppress an outbreak. However COVID-19 has proved to be a particular challenge and large-scale lockdowns have been a needed antidote for controlling outbreaks in several countries. The drastic self-quarantine orders can also reduce case numbers to a more manageable level and hopefully allow for effective contact tracing in the event of incidence occurrence after easing restrictions. The capacity to respond to the continuing threat of COVID-19 will be vital for minimization of sequential epidemic waves. We investigated control measures under an instantaneous normalization of contact for a large portion (or several sectors) of the population versus a more gradual release of self-quarantined individuals back into social interactions. Our results show that increased contact tracing efforts can alter the second outbreak shape, either reducing and spreading out the number of infected or completely suppressing cases for highly efficient tracing. Social distancing or lockdown measures responsive to incidence can effectively compress the second peaks, with the timing being critical again. Either measure will depend upon sufficient case detection and reporting, highlighting the importance of testing. Furthermore, in-17   ()   . definite or reoccurring strict lockdowns are likely to impart too high of an economic cost, and our model shows that looser restrictions and contact tracing can still reduce a second wave to manageable levels. Additionally, the strategy of gradual release of quarantined sectors can substantially delay the second wave, possibly buying time for effective treatments or vaccines to be developed. There are factors not considered in our current study which may have played an important role in determining the COVID-19 epidemic in China. For example, we neglect a more finegrained regional structure within China for our model and data fitting. However, a major novelty of this work was to incorporate data on the quarantined contacts, which was compiled solely for the whole of China. Obtaining provincial quarantine records may allow for simultaneous fitting of the heterogeneous spread of the virus in different regions of China. Furthermore, more detailed contact tracing data quantifying the proportion of reported cases whom were traced can allow for superior accuracy in estimating efficacy of contact tracing, which can add confidence to our conclusion that lockdowns had substantially larger influence in controlling the COVID-19 outbreak data. Nevertheless, the analytical and qualitative results here illustrate the differential effects that reactive contact tracing and lockdowns or mass self-quarantine have on outbreak shape. This knowledge and further investigation may offer insights for the public health response to COVID-19 outbreaks.   ()   .

65056,"Using an agent-based model we have simulated the relaxation of a variety of policy restrictions in a low transmission setting in Australia. We found that policy changes leading to large, unstructured contact networks (e.g. pubs and bars opening, increased public transport use through removal of work from home directives, or large events) posed the greatest risk, while policy changes leading to smaller, structured contact networks with known individuals (e.g. small social gatherings) posed the least risk. Importantly, the model suggests that it could take more than two months to detect increases in new infections from a change in policy, and therefore care should be taken in introducing multiple policy changes within short time periods. These outcomes, and this modelling tool, have implications for other settings with low community transmission where governments are lifting restrictions following relatively successful early responses.

In particular, working from home directions should be maintained to minimise use of public transport.

65114,"The ongoing COVID-19 epidemics poses a particular challenge to low and middle income countries, making some of them consider the strategy of vertical confinement. In this strategy, contact is reduced only to specific groups (like age groups) that are at increased risk of severe disease following SARS-CoV-2 infection. We aim to assess the feasibility of this scenario as an exit strategy for the current lockdown in terms of its ability to keep the number of cases under the health care system capacity. We developed a modified SEIR model, including confinement, asymptomatic transmission, quarantine and hospitalization. The population is subdivided into 9 age groups, resulting in a system of 72 coupled nonlinear differential equations. The rate of transmission is dynamic and derived from the observed delayed fatality rate; the parameters of the epidemics are derived with a Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm. We used Brazil as an example of middle income country, but the results are easily generalizable to other countries considering a similar strategy. We find that starting from 60% horizontal confinement, an exit strategy on May 1st of confinement of individuals older than 60 years old and full release of the younger population results in 400 000 hospitalizations, 50 000 ICU cases, and 120 000 deaths in the 50-60 years old age group alone. The health care system avoids collapse if the 50-60 years old are also confined, but our model assumes an idealized lockdown where the confined are perfectly insulated from contamination, so our numbers are a conservative lower bound. Our results discourage confinement by age as an exit strategy.","The ongoing COVID-19 epidemics poses a particular challenge to low and middle income countries, making some of them consider the strategy of vertical confinement.<q>In this strategy, contact is reduced only to specific groups (like age groups) that are at increased risk of severe disease following SARS-CoV-2 infection.<q>We developed a modified SEIR model, including confinement, asymptomatic transmission, quarantine and hospitalization.

65314,"  ()  China has closed schools and adopted home quarantine measures since the outbreak of COVID-19 to control the spread of SARS-CoV 2 [3] . Our research found that primary school students, overall, were susceptible to social anxiety during home quarantine. We found 279 out of 1620 (17.2%) primary school students had social anxiety. Compared with their norms, primary school students who were quarantined at home had significantly higher social anxiety scores, indicating that the prolonged (at least one month) period of strict home quarantine during the epidemic tended to increase social anxiety, consistent with previous research on the social anxiety of children after major disasters [20] . Communities, families and schools should pay more attention to the social anxiety status of primary school students during the epidemic. Our study found that males were more likely than females to have social anxiety during the epidemic, which differs from the findings of previous studies that investigated children living a normal life [21, 22] . The children in our study were quarantined at home during the epidemic and the active nature of these students, especially the male students, could not be fully expressed in the relatively small indoor spaces. The psychological problems of the 279 students with social anxiety can be partially attributed to the deterioration of their parent-child relationship during home quarantine, and increased conflict between parents and children. Students with social anxiety were more likely to have a deteriorated parent-child relationship (13.6% vs 4.4%) and conflicts with parents (42.6% vs 23.8%). Social anxiety is a common response of primary school students to a deterioration in the parent-child relationship and conflict [23] . Results from twins and family studies over the past three decades have confirmed that childhood social anxiety is influenced by both genetic factors [24] , and parental factors, including parenting styles and   ()   .   parent-child interactions [25] . The deterioration of the parent-child relationship is usually caused by the limited or inconsistent expression of care and warmth, and excessive protection and control [25] . Family interventions should be taken based on the five basic principles of promoting a sense of security: helping children learn to be calm and stable in a crisis and have a sense of self-worth and a sense of family or group belonging, promoting social ties, and instilling hope [26] . Irregular learning and rest is another risk factor for social anxiety in primary school students, as this leads to irregular diet, and sleep and physical activity, resulting in a decline in sleep quality. A 2018 study [27] reported that poor sleep quality was related to increased anxiety. In addition, regular aerobic exercise can help reduce anxiety [28] . Keeping a regular life schedule, such as learning and rest time during home quarantine, can prevent or decrease social anxiety among primary school students. In addition, worry about being infected and negative emotions during the epidemic could have increased the likelihood of social anxiety. Since COVID-19 is a novel infectious disease without specific drugs and vaccines [3] , the wide and rapid spread of the epidemic during its early stage could have easily caused panic in the population and led to psychological distress [3] . Scientific education about COVID-19, especially preventive and protective measures, may help ease fear of infection and reduce anxiety. Interestingly, we found the level of depressive symptoms of the students quarantined at home was significantly lower than the norm, which is inconsistent with previous studies on depression among children facing major disasters [29, 30] . The reason for this may be that even though the COVID-19 epidemic was widespread, no students or family members in our   ()   .   study reported being infected. They were quarantined at home, which was a safe place during the early stage, and had not faced the crisis directly. More importantly, compared to ordinary times, home quarantine increased the time for parent-child interaction, especially time with parents, as the students' parents were also quarantined at home. However, no significant difference was found in parent-child activity time between students with and without depression in our study. The increased frequency and quality of interactions between parents and children can improve children's depression [31, 32] . Moreover, the increased parent-child interaction time can reinforce a child's attachment to and approval from the family, and depression is inversely related to attachment, family support, and approval [33] . We found the students with depressive disorders had a poor parent-child relationship， which was a risk factor for depression during home quarantine. Family dysfunction often persists when the relationship between parents and children deteriorates [34] , and leads to chronic and persistent relapses of depression [35] . Therefore, it is very important to improve parent-child relationships during home quarantine. We also found that less physical activity and irregular learning and rest schedules were risk factors for depression. Students who exercised more than three times a week had a significantly lower risk of developing depressive symptoms. A recent study conducted by Kandola et al. found that increased sedentary behavior and less activity were associated with an increased risk of depressive symptoms at the age of 18 [5] , which is consistent with our results. In addition, negative emotions of the students related to the virus outbreak can also lead to depression. The thickness of the frontal cortex of patients with depression is different from that of healthy people [36] , and negative emotions are usually found to be related to frontal dysfunction [37].   ()   .   A loving and comforting family environment can be helpful for reducing negative emotions. Our study indicates that primary school students quarantined at home during the COVID-19 epidemic were prone to social anxiety but less likely to suffer from depression. Although the two psychological disorders share common risk factors (e.g., deteriorating parent-child relationship, increased conflicts with parents, and irregular learning and rest), we believe that social isolation itself may be the main cause of social anxiety, whereas depression is affected more by parent-child relationships and interactions. Close attention should be paid to the psychological status of children and adolescents during a virus outbreak, especially those who are quarantined at home. Early identification of and interventions for social anxiety and depression should be considered when developing strategies and countermeasures against COVID-19 epidemics for schools and communities.

Specifically, super-spreaders, or the fat tail of the degree distribution, matter a lot, in addition to the mean degree. The expected number of infections of a random individual, r, in many models equivalent to R 0 , is not a good enough indicator of epidemic spread. It is also obviously not a property of a virus itself, since it depends on many other conditions, such as social, living & hygiene conditions. We showed that the graph structure has a very large influence on the effective reproduction number, R, even when r stays constant, because of dynamics of the epidemic spread. It is therefore crucial to model the graph structure to reach the right conclusions about epidemic spread. . CC-BY 4.0    To compare different policies against each other, we need to explain what the policies are and what outcomes we care about. Let's start with the outcomes. The three main outcomes we'll track here are the following. • Share of the population eventually infected. This is the proportion of individuals who are infected at some point before the epidemic is eradicated. Some fraction of this is the deaths, so this is obviously important. We term a share of fewer than 5% ""containment"". . CC-BY 4.0    In conclusion, there are a few tools at our disposal to decrease the effective reproduction number R below 1 and achieve containment: • Testing symptomatic individuals -helps a lot, but not enough on its own. The faster and more hermetic it is, the more effective it is. • Contact tracing -helps a lot as well. • Social distancing to slow the base rate of spread. • Mass testing -requires a lot of tests to have an effect, so less effective. .

65369,"We propose a new way of estimating the incubation time only from the publicly available epidemiological data of the number of infections. The two advantages of this approach are that the exposure history is not required and in a pandemic one can work with data tens of thousands of infections. In the publicly available data on the number of new infections from different countries, one sees that the number of daily new cases (I(t)) actually increase for a few days (t) after the lockdown (t=0), before they decline. In an ideal scenario, the new cases after lockdown come from the individuals who were infected in the preceding days and after a certain incubation are becoming symptomatic. Thus the number of new infections on day 1, depends on the asymptomatic ones on day 0 (A(0)) and an incubation of 1 day, as well as the ones infected on day -1 and with an incubation of 2 days, and so on. Mathematically, the predicted number of infections I*(t) on day t after the lockdown is Eq (1) where µ(t+t; l,k) represents the distribution of the incubation period which we assume to be a Weibull distribution with parameters l and k, without loss of generality. Convoluting two functions such as in Eq. (1) is a standard approach in the linear response theory. We further assume that on any day prior to the lockdown the number of asymptomatic infections is proportional to the number of reported infections (A(-t) = a.I(-t) ). We performed a linear regression analysis between the infections observed after lockdown I(t) and the predicted ones I*(t) for various choices of l and k ( Figures 1A,B,C) . The values of l and k for which the regression coefficient was the highest was considered the maximum likelihood estimate of the incubation period ( Figure 1D ). We find that the incubation time follows a Weibull distribution of µ(t+t; l,k) with parameters l=16, k=2 best helps the infections before lockdown from Austria, Spain and Germany ( Figure  1D ) to predict the ones after. In working with the epidemiological data, we developed an estimation of the incubation period of the virus in the community, which may in principle be the same as that for the individuals in a perfectly implemented quarantine. In summary, we introduced a new way of estimating the incubation time by studying the new infection that arise after measures that restrict the interactions between the individuals in the community to a minimal or non-existent level. The advantages are that it is easy estimate. The estimates we made for three European countries suggest an incubation time with a median of 13.3 days. Models for public health should consider estimates for incubation time in the community, such as what we introduce here, for a better understanding of the differences between new cases arising after the incubation and the genuinely newer ones.

Similar graphs like A, B, C were generated for l between 5 to 20 to identify the value that best suits the data. l=16 optimizes the Weibull distribution for the data studied. k=2 was used in this analysis.

65432,"Determining the viral dynamics and natural history of SARS-CoV-2 in different populations is crucial towards instituting public health policies and granting clearance for infected patients. The results of this study suggest that in young and healthy adult patients with COVID-19, the median duration of viral positivity is around three weeks. This duration is higher than previous reports of a median between 9.5 and 20 days. [5] [6] [7] These differences may arise from differing study populations, test kits, and procedures. We postulate that the settings in the rehabilitation center, which allowed for patients with mild symptoms to dwell in close quarters with other confirmed patients, may have brought about daily re-exposure and prolonged viral positivity durations. Our study adds to the current knowledge concerning the COVID-19 outbreak and sheds light on the duration of RT-PCR positivity in young patients with mild symptoms. Seeing as young and healthy adults comprise much of the population workforce, the results of this study may assist in determining the isolation period for symptomatic adults and confirmed COVID-19 patients with mild symptoms. Furthermore, we believe that achieving serial RT-PCR testing for all confirmed patients or outpatients with mild symptoms would require vast resource consumption. Therefore, achieving a further understanding of viral dynamics could help determine the correct temporality of testing for confirmed patients experiencing recovery. It should be noted that negative RT-PCR testing does not necessarily dictate full clearance as both false-negative results 2,4,8 and persistence of radiological abnormalities 9 have been described. Additionally, the detection of SARS-CoV-2 in bodily fluids does not necessarily render an individual contagious. Our study is limited by its small sample size and needs to be replicated on a mass scale to shed implications on the general population. It should also be noted that all patients in our cohort were symptomatic, and population screening efforts are required to determine the rate of disease and spread by asymptomatic individuals. In conclusion, our study demonstrates that the median time for SARS-CoV-2 clearance is around three weeks in young adults with mild symptoms. These findings may provide evidence for instituting quarantine and return to work policies in settings primarily composed of young and healthy adults such as higher education institutions, highschools and the military. .

65451,"Given the global impact of emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases, a number of methods have been developed to estimate and analyse the basic reproductive number R0, which is the hallmark of infectious diseases transmission (Blumberg & Lloyd-Smith, 2013) , the most used approaches are based on four factor; i. the contact frequency, ii. the contact efficacy (both i & ii form the effective contact rate), in addition to; iii. the susceptible population size and iv. the infectious phase duration. However, these four parameters require time and numerous studies to be identified correctly, thus, in case of global emergencies such as the COVID-19 pandemic, we need quick results to assess the situation and the taken measures, especially in low and middle income countries where people in general are most affected. Our assessment was mainly based on the evolution of R0, which was daily estimated using equation 2, taking as baseline prevalence 7 days before, we did not use the previous day prevalence to avoid variations due to postponement of cases declarations. Monitoring of R0's variations during the epidemic shows a remarkable progressive decrease over the last weeks (Fig.2) , as mentioned in the results part, the highest R0 was recorded the second week at the national level and in Blida 4,26 (95% CI 2,65-5,88), and 3,28 (95% CI 2,28-4,27), respectively, as regards to outside Blida, the highest R0 equal 3.2 (95% CI 2,44-3,95) was reported two weeks later on the 4 th week.

65478,"We evaluate the effect of measures based on the deployment of a digital contact tracing app on the mitigation of the Covid-19 pandemic. As we do not consider geography nor large-scale mobility, our modeling can be considered as referring to a limited geographical area, similarly to previous modeling efforts. 1, 35 In particular, we assume that two types of interventions are possible to limit the spread of the virus. In this study, we have analyzed the ability of digital tracing policies to contain the spread of Covid-19 outbreaks, using real interaction datasets to extract the main effective parameters and to shed light on the practical consequences of the implementation of various app policies. We found that the set of parameters that allow containment of the spread is strongly restricted by the fraction of asymptomatic cases. By first assuming an ideal setting where any pair of parameters ε I , ε T is possible, we showed ( Figure 3 ) that perfect contact and isolation policies are required if only symptomatic people can be detected and a realistic fraction of asymptomatic cases (40%) is assumed. We have thus assumed in addition that 50% of the asymptomatic can be detected by randomized testing (see Figure 5 ). We remark that this is in contrast with the scenario considered in Fraser et al. 3 and in Ferretti et al., 1 where all the infected population is eventually assumed to become symptomatic. We tested five policies to define risky contacts that should be traced (Table 1) , with different restriction levels. When implemented on real contact data measured by Bluetooth, they allow us to estimate, for each value of ε I , the actual value of ε T and thus to determine the efficacy of each policy (colored points in Figure 5 ). Using these implementations on real data restricts the available values of the control parameters and, as a consequence, only the most restrictive policies lead to epidemic containment.

Here we propose an extended SEIR model to explore the dynamics of containment and then explore scenarios for the local extinction of the disease. We present both the deterministic and stochastic version fo the model and derive the R0 and the probability of local extinction after relaxation (elimination of transmission) of containment, P0. We show that local extinctions are possible without further interventions, with reasonable probability, as long as the number of active cases is driven to single digits and strict control of case importation is maintained. The maintenance of defensive behaviors, such as using masks and avoiding agglomerations are also important factors. We also explore the importance of population immunity even when above the herd immunity threshold.","We present both the deterministic and stochastic version fo the model and derive the R0 and the probability of local extinction after relaxation (elimination of transmission) of containment, P0.<q>We show that local extinctions are possible without further interventions, with reasonable probability, as long as the number of active cases is driven to single digits and strict control of case importation is maintained.<q>Roughly six months into the COVID-19 pandemic, many countries have managed to contain the spread of the virus by means of strict containment measures including quarantine, tracing and isolation of patients as well strong restrictions on population mobility.

65543,"All Canadian provinces have developed COVID-19 self-assessment tools that allow the general public to assess what action they should take based on symptoms, exposure to others, and travel. However, the similarities end there as no two provinces engage in the same screening. Even in a cross-Canada pandemic as devastating as this, there is not a single, evidence-based Canadian standard of care simply for self-assessment. This is despite the Public Health Agency of Canada publishing a national COVID-19 case definition on February 6, 2020 (20), since updated from time to time to be consistent with WHO definitions. (21) Instead each province has devised a tool, based its own case definition or perception of the scientific evidence, inevitably resulting in chaos and errors. To use a metaphor, not only have provinces wasted resources and time ""reinventing the wheel"", but some of their wheels are more oval than round. Most concerning is the fact that some provinces have developed their tools at variance with medical evidence, and these tools negligently furnish disinformation on a potentially deadly illness. It is likely that provinces used sources of information from outbreaks in other countries to formulate their decision algorithms. The Report of the WHO-China Joint Mission on Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), released in February 2020 lists these diagnostic symptoms in descending order: fever, dry cough, fatigue, sputum production, shortness of breath, sore throat, headache, myalgia or arthralgia, chills, nausea or vomiting, nasal congestion, diarrhea, hemoptysis and conjunctival congestion. (22) Similar advice is given by the Public Health Agency of Canada in its daily epidemiology updates, and at the end of March 2020, cough, headache and chills were the three most frequently reported symptoms. (6) Yet many provinces have created self-assessment tools that ignore this medical evidence. Most alarming is British Columbia, Saskatchewan and Newfoundland & Labrador informing users with headache and chills (Patients C and D) that they do not have COVID-19 symptoms-negligent advice that were it given by a clinician rather than a computer would be medical malpractice.   ()   .   Similarly concerning is Nova Scotia's tool, which considers only travel-associated risks and entirely overlooks that COVID-19 can be transmitted in the province without travel. Perhaps aware of this failure Nova Scotia withdrew its self-assessment tool after the data for this study was collected, and as of this writing (8 April 2020), it has been replaced with a single screen advising individuals with certain symptoms to call a helpline for further assessment. There are two extremely serious epidemiological consequences to the failure of the provinces to align on a single standard of care in self-assessment. First, without consistent public health advice as to who has COVID-19 symptoms, or agreement on what constitutes a possible COVID-19 case, there is a fundamental failure to ensure that Canadians appropriately self-isolate to mitigate community transmission, which risks causing infection and illness to others and worsening the pandemic. Second, there is a fundamental failure to give appropriate advice to users about when to present for COVID-19 testing, so as to become tallied as a confirmed case if positive. This failure in turn introduces systematic errors into provincial counts of confirmed cases, making epidemiological comparisons between provinces inaccurate and misleading, and degrading the quality of critical epidemiological models-which Canada requires to guide safe de-escalation of social distancing, timely reinstatement of civic institutions and the economic activity, and overall a return to normalcy. These failures could be avoided. Following the 2003 SARS outbreak, the federal government and provinces collaborated in assessing ""lessons learned"" and agreed to coordinate outbreak response. (23) The failure to have a single, federal self-assessment tool-or multiple provincial tools all conforming to a single standard of care-is proof that in 17 years, coordination has failed. In our opinion, this failure mandates two federal responses. In the short term (under a week), the federal government should develop a single self-assessment tool for COVID-19, in both official languages, and perhaps also languages of immigrants, which provinces should assist to develop and adopt. This would solve the immediate problem of lacking a single, evidence-based standard of care for self-assessment. In the intermediate term (a month or two), the federal government must introduce legislation to ensure that other dimensions of the COVID-19 response are not undermined by poor coordination. As the federal government concluded in its ""lessons learned"" report from SARS 2003: In the event that a coordinated system of rules for infectious disease surveillance and outbreak management cannot be established by the combined effects of the [federal, provincial and territorial governments] and the above-referenced intergovernmental legislative review, the   ()   .   Government of Canada should initiate the drafting of default legislation to set up such a system of rules, clarifying F/P/T interactions as regards public health matters with specific reference to infectious diseases. (21, p.216) The absence of a single, evidence-based standard of care for self-assessment furnishes clear evidence that, in the 17 years since SARS, provincial and federal governments cannot coordinate in the timely manner demanded by epidemics or pandemics. Parliament therefore must use its available jurisdiction to legislate a duty on both to follow national standards, so as to improve coordination on COVID-19 in coming months. (24)   ()   .

65677,"Since Jan 23rd 2020, after outbreak of the novel atypical pneumonia, government has applied substantial draconian intervention measures to drastically reduce within-population contact rates. These measures include extending the Spring Festival holiday, and instituting work-from-home arrangements, postpone the start of Spring semester, Nurseries and early learning centers closures, cancellation of mass gatherings, wearing masks at public palce, and so on. However, the reported case numbers are still rising rapidly. Simulating the epidemic spreading trend of 2019-nCoV under the control measures are of crucial importance for public health planning and control domestically and internationally. Several earlier publications have given some useful forecasting of 2019-nCoV [4, 5, [8] [9] [10] [11] , but their estimating numbers are too far more than the official data. The estimating of epidemic spreading should consider the effect of actions have been taken to mitigate the spreading. Furthermore, the asymptomatic infection and transmission characters should be considered in the transmission model. Transmission model and parameters are essential for the generation of accurate forecasting of infected population and spreading trend [12] . In this study, we have constructed a novel EIR transmission model to stimulate the epidemic spreading. On the trajectory of simulating curve of baseline scenario, the peak number of infected population of 2019-nCoV will be 49093 on Feb 16, and it could be securely contained the spread of infection under the current draconian intervention measures. However, these intervention measures should be kept for about 2 months until the end of April. And extremely draconian level prevention measures should be kept at least an incubation period after the infected population peak. In the baseline scenario, the government takes the strict prevention actions, the estimate numbers fit the official numbers very well. There can be no . CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0   author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity. is the (which was not peer-reviewed)    doubt that the official numbers are accurate. Simulating result also tells that the quarantined rate, which present the degree of the prevention measures, has great effect on the peak number and duration of the epidemic spreading. Only the quarantined rate is higher than 80%, the epidemic spreading could be reduced drastically and the identified population would be less than 5000 in the end of March 2020. Even at the threshold degree, when the quarantined rate is 63%, the infected population would up to a peak number 115022 and keep at that number for ever unless more strict prevention measures are taken. If the quarantined rate is less than 63% the epidemic spreading of 2019-nCoV will never be eliminated and the infected population would still keep increasing. The simulation results of different action starting date support the common sense that the control action should be taken as early as possible. Specifically, simulation results tells that the action starting date of prevention measures later than Jan. 23, 2020, the peak of identified individuals would be greatly increased. And the wipe out date also would be delayed. The modelling techniques that we used in this study are based on SEIR and system dynamics. And our model is parameterized with the latest official released data of 2019-nCoV. An additional strength of our study is that simulation of the baseline scenario is well fit the trajectory of the official data of epidemic spreading. Nonetheless, our study has several major limitations. First, we assumed that the transmission of 2019-nCoV mainly caused by exposed individuals (without symptoms) and the transmission ability of identified (without symptoms) is ignored. Second, our transmission model was somewhat sensitive to several key parameters: the starting date of epidemic spreading, the exposed (incubation) period and the identified (treatment) period. And our assumption regarding the exposed (incubation) period and the identified (treatment) period is keeping stable. If 2019-nCoV, similar to influenza, has strong seasonality in its transmission, our epidemic forecast might not be reliable.

65733,"To our knowledge, this is the first study to perform weakly-supervised computer-aided COVID-19 detection with a large number of CT volumes from the frontline hospital at the present epidemic period. By designing an effective weakly-supervised deep learning-based algorithm and training it on CT volumes collected before Jan 23, 2020 with only patient-level labels, the testing results on 131 CT scans collected from Jan 24, 2020, to Feb 6, 2020, were very impressive, e.g., the PR AUC value was 0.975. On the ROC curve, the algorithm obtained sensitivity and specificity values larger than 0.9, which were both clinically applicable. The motivation of this study was to utilize AI to alleviate the problem of shortage of professional interpretations for CT images when the epidemic is still fast spreading. Though there were many effective applications of medical AI in previous studies [13, 23] , developing AI for automatic COVID-19 detection was still a challenging task. Firstly, in the current emergency situation, the number of enrolled patients is relatively smaller compared with that used in previous studies [13, 23] ; and patients enrolled in our study were clinically diagnosed cases with COVID-19, because the majority of them did not undergo the nucleic acid testing due to the sudden outbreak and limited medical resource in such a short time period. Secondly, the lesions of COVID-19 in CT volumes were not labeled by radiologists and only patientlevel labels (i.e., COVID-positive or COVID-negative) were utilized for training the AI algorithm in our study. Thirdly, some small infected areas of COVID-19 have the potential to be missed even by professional radiologists, and whether it is feasible to be detected by deep learning-based 3D DCNN model remains unclear. We hypothesized to solve these problems by proposing a delicate 3D DCNN, i.e., DeCoVNet. It solved the first problem by applying extensive data augmentation on training CT volumes to obtain more training examples. The second problem was solved by regarding the COVID-19 detection problem as a weakly-supervised learning problem [24] , i.e., detecting COVID-19 without annotating the regions of COVID-19 lesions. In the designed DeCoVNet, we used the spatially global pooling layer and the temporally global pooling layer to technically handle the weakly-supervised COVID-19 detection problem. The third problem was addressed by taking the advantages of deep learning and utilizing a pre-trained UNet for providing the lung masks to guide the learning of DeCoVNet. The deep learning-based COVID-19 diagnostic algorithm used in our study is effective compared to recent deep learning-based computer-aided diagnosis methods. On the task of predicting the risk of lung cancer [13] , the deep learning model was trained on 42290 CT cases from 14851 patients and obtained 0.944 ROC AUC. On the task of critical findings from head CT [23] , the deep learning model was trained on 310055 head CT scans and obtained ROC AUC of 0.920. In our study, only 499 scans were used for training, but the obtained ROC AUC was 0.959. By comparing the data between them, it was able to find that the task of COVID-19 detection may be easier and the proposed deep learning algorithm was very powerful. As for the erroneous 12 false negative predictions in our results, the most possible explanations after we rechecked the original CT images were listed as follows: those lesions were slightly increased in CT densities, and images of those ground-glass opacities were very faint without consolidation. Our study provided a typical and successful solution for developing medical AI for emerging diseases, such as COVID-19. While we were developing this AI, doctors in Wuhan were still extremely busy with treating a huge number of COVID-19 patients and it may be impossible for them to annotate the lesions in CT volumes in the current austere fight against this epidemic. Thanks to the weaklysupervised algorithm in this study, locations of pulmonary lesions in CT volumes are not necessary to be annotated, and radiologists' annotating efforts can be minimized, i.e., only providing patient-level 10 . CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0    ()  .   labels. Therefore, developing a helpful AI tool swiftly has become possible and available in the clinical application. In the future, the burden of AI experts could be lifted significantly by automatic machine learning (AutoML) [25] . Limitations of this study There are still several limitations in this study. First, network design and training may be further improved. For example, the UNet model for lung segmentation did not utilize temporal information and it was trained using imperfect ground-truth masks, which could be improved by using 3D segmentation networks and adopting precise ground-truth annotated by experts. Second, the data used in this study came from a single hospital and cross-center validations were not performed. Third, when diagnosing COVID-19, the algorithm worked in a black-box manner, since the algorithm was based on deep learning and its explainability was still at an early stage. Related work of all limitations mentioned above will be addressed in our further studies. In conclusion, without the need for annotating the COVID-19 lesions in CT volumes for training, our weakly-supervised deep learning algorithm obtained strong COVID-19 detection performance. Therefore, our algorithm has great potential to be applied in clinical application for accurate and rapid COVID-19 diagnosis, which is of great help for the frontline medical staff and is also vital to control this epidemic worldwide.

The motivation of this study was to utilize AI to alleviate the problem of shortage of professional interpretations for CT images when the epidemic is still fast spreading.

65762,"Background: The Chinese government implemented a metropolitan-wide quarantine of Wuhan city on 23rd January 2020 to curb the epidemic of the coronavirus COVID-19. Lifting of this quarantine is imminent. We modelled the effects of two key health interventions on the epidemic when the quarantine is lifted. Method: We constructed a compartmental dynamic model to forecast the trend of the COVID-19 epidemic at different quarantine lifting dates and investigated the impact of different rates of public contact and facial mask usage on the epidemic. Results: We estimated that at the end of the epidemic, a total of 65,572 (46,156-95,264) individuals would be infected by the virus, among which 16,144 (14,422-23,447, 24.6%) would be infected through public contacts, 45,795 (32,390-66,395, 69.7%) through household contact, 3,633 (2,344-5,865, 5.5%) through hospital contacts (including 783 (553-1,134) non-COVID-19 patients and 2,850 (1,801-4,981) medical staff members). A total of 3,262 (1,592-6,470) would die of COVID-19 related pneumonia in Wuhan. For an early lifting date (21st March), facial mask needed to be sustained at a relatively high rate (≥85%) if public contacts were to recover to 100% of the pre-quarantine level. In contrast, lifting the quarantine on 18th April allowed public person-to-person contact adjusted back to the pre-quarantine level with a substantially lower level of facial mask usage (75%). However, a low facial mask usage (<50%) combined with an increased public contact (>100%) would always lead a significant second outbreak in most quarantine lifting scenarios. Lifting the quarantine on 25th April would ensure a smooth decline of the epidemics regardless of the combinations of public contact rates and facial mask usage. Conclusion: The prevention of a second epidemic is viable after the metropolitan-wide quarantine is lifted but requires a sustaining high facial mask usage and a low public contact rate.","Background: The Chinese government implemented a metropolitan-wide quarantine of Wuhan city on 23rd January 2020 to curb the epidemic of the coronavirus COVID-19.<q>Lifting of this quarantine is imminent.<q>Results: We estimated that at the end of the epidemic, a total of 65,572 (46,156-95,264) individuals would be infected by the virus, among which 16,144 (14,422-23,447, 24.

65853,"Our study showed that in the initial week of the outbreak, there is a large number of people who are infected, and behave as active and super active spreader but in about 5-6 weeks of the time they become negligible. Many super active spreaders are becoming aware of the mode of disease transmission and stop spreading the infection by self-isolation. However, there are still exposed and hospitalized individuals who are responsible for resurgence or second wave of infection at around 7-8 weeks of time. Bifurcation analysis showed that Rc (critical point) is 2.23 and Ro is 3.5, and by observing the current situation of this pandemic, it is very difficult to bring the value of Ro below Rc in a short period of time. All the control measures including self-isolation, quarantine, herd immunity, immunotherapy, and plasma therapy should be applied together to fight back COVID-19 in around 50 days. Effectiveness of self-isolation varies between 10-32%, quarantine is about 21%, herd immunity is about 20%, immune therapy is 33% and plasma therapy is about 10%. Optimal timing of the plasma therapy is around 15 days from the infection while immunotherapy should be implemented earlier to get maximum benefit. Thus we conclude that the COVID-19 outbreak can be controlled up to a significant level three weeks after applying all the control strategies including self-isolation, quarantine, and hospitalization together. Furthermore, proper control strategies are of paramount importance in breaking this periodic chain of infection and preventing the resurgence of infection.

We aim to evaluate the impact of containment measures and the epidemic features of COVID-19 under social NPIs in Mainland China. Methods Under the strict social NPIs, the spreading pattern of COVID-19 in China has changed into mostly clustered intra-household or intro-acquaintance transmission, and we established a stochastic NPIs model, named ScEIQRsh to fit the epidemic and NPIs data of each province in China. Results This ScEIQRsh model could be well fitted with both the reported number of accumulative confirmed cases and epidemiological survey (EPS)-based quarantined cases of each province in China. We found that the median transmission rate of COVID-19 among acquaintances was 10.22 (IQR 8.47, 12.35) across Mainland China and the COVID-19 spreading was prevented by NPIs implementation within 25-30 days. Among NPIs, measures to diminish contactable susceptible (Sc), such as staying home, travel constraint etc. and measures to avoid delay of diagnosis and hospitalized isolation ({eta}) were more effective than EPS-based quarantine ({kappa},{rho} or surveyQ). Upon the fitted models, the proportion of asymptomatic infectors was determined to be 14.88% (IQR 8.17%, 25.37%). The median incubation period and communicable period of COVID-19 under NPIs were 4.16 (IQR 3.60, 4.71) and 6.77 (IQR 4.53, 10.36) days respectively, and the median time from exposed to being contagious was 2.39 (IQR 2.26, 2.56) days. Besides, we identified that the optimal temperature for COVID-19 spreading was in the range of 5{degrees}C-14{degrees}C. Conclusion This study provided useful suggestions about NPI strategy for the prevention of COVID-19 spreading, which should be helpful for the control of COVID-19, as well as other similar infectious disease.","Background The COVID-19 is spreading worldwide, early non-pharmaceutical Interventions (NPIs) is crucial for mitigating COVID-19 epidemic.<q>Results This ScEIQRsh model could be well fitted with both the reported number of accumulative confirmed cases and epidemiological survey (EPS)-based quarantined cases of each province in China.<q>We aim to evaluate the impact of containment measures and the epidemic features of COVID-19 under social NPIs in Mainland China.

66138,"Countries around the world are in a state of lockdown to help limit the spread of SARS-CoV-2. However, as the number of new daily confirmed cases begins to decrease, governments must decide how to release their populations from quarantine as efficiently as possible without overwhelming their health services. We applied an optimal control framework to an adapted Susceptible-Exposure-Infection-Recovery (SEIR) model framework to investigate the efficacy of two potential lockdown release strategies, focusing on the UK population as a test case. To limit recurrent spread, we find that ending quarantine for the entire population simultaneously is a high-risk strategy, and that a gradual re-integration approach would be more reliable. Furthermore, to increase the number of people that can be first released, lockdown should not be ended until the number of new daily confirmed cases reaches a sufficiently low threshold. We model a gradual release strategy by allowing different fractions of those in lockdown to re-enter the working non-quarantined population. Mathematical optimisation methods, combined with our adapted SEIR model, determine how to maximise those working while preventing the health service from being overwhelmed. The optimal strategy is broadly found to be to release approximately half the population two-to-four weeks from the end of an initial infection peak, then wait another three-to-four months to allow for a second peak before releasing everyone else. We also modelled an ''on-off'' strategy, of releasing everyone, but re-establishing lockdown if infections become too high. We conclude that the worst-case scenario of a gradual release is more manageable than the worst-case scenario of an on-off strategy, and caution against lockdown-release strategies based on a threshold-dependent on-off mechanism. The two quantities most critical in determining the optimal solution are transmission rate and the recovery rate, where the latter is defined as the fraction of infected people in any given day that then become classed as recovered. We suggest that the accurate identification of these values is of particular importance to the ongoing monitoring of the pandemic.","Countries around the world are in a state of lockdown to help limit the spread of SARS-CoV-2.<q>However, as the number of new daily confirmed cases begins to decrease, governments must decide how to release their populations from quarantine as efficiently as possible without overwhelming their health services.<q>To limit recurrent spread, we find that ending quarantine for the entire population simultaneously is a high-risk strategy, and that a gradual re-integration approach would be more reliable.

66233,"In the paper we present an SEIR model with Asymptomatic and Quarantined compartments to describe the recent and ongoing COVID-19 outbreak. Our model is intended to highlight the strength of three different non-pharmaceutical interventions imposed by public policies in containing the outbreak and the total number of disease-induced infections and deaths: -reduction of contact rate for a given portion of the population; -enforced quarantine for confirmed infectious individuals; -testing among the population to detect also asymptomatic infectious individuals. On one hand we show that, as expected, each of these interventions has a beneficial impact on flattening the curve of the outbreak. On the other hand, the comparison among different scenarios shows the remarkable efficacy of an early massive testing approach, when the limited number of infected individuals makes easier and more effective the tracing of recent contacts of the individual, as in Scenario D 1 , and of a timely lockdown, although in the presence of few confirmed infected cases, as in Scenario C 1 . In both situations, the timing of the intervention plays a crucial role on the incisiveness of the public safety policy. In addition, we give an explicit representation of the basic reproduction number in terms of the several parameters of the model, which allows to describe its dependence on the features of the virus and on the implemented non-pharmaceutical interventions. This description makes available a valuable tool to tune the public policies in order to control the outbreak of the epidemic, forcing R 0 below the threshold 1. However, considering the major effects of an enduring lockdown on the economy of the country that applies it, it is desirable to loosen the lockdown measures after the containment of the outbreak. Nevertheless, the decision makers and each individual shall be aware that a value of R 0 only barely greater than 1 would lead to an increase in the number of infected and dead by an order 2 of magnitude, thus provoking the collapse of the relative national health system. This is better explained by the following scenarios: consider a situation with constant testing ρ = 0.05 and no lockdown where, after the first 35 days of outbreak with a high R 0 (≈ 2), the population gains awareness of the risk and manage to reduce its contact 17 .

66245,"In this work we present an analysis of the two major strategies currently implemented around the world in the fight against COVID-19: Social distancing & shelter-in-place measures to protect the susceptible, and testing & contact-tracing to identify, isolate and treat the infected. The majority of countries have principally relied on the former; we consider the examples of Italy, Canada and the United States. By fitting a disease transmission model to daily case report data, we infer that in each of the three countries, the current level of national shutdown is equivalent to about half the population being under quarantine. We demonstrate that in the absence of other measures, scaling back social distancing in such a way as to prevent a second wave will take prohibitively long. In contrast, South Korea, a country that has managed to control and suppress its outbreak principally through mass testing and contact tracing, and has only instated a partial shutdown. For all four countries, we estimate the level of testing which would be required to allow a complete exit from shutdown and a full lifting of social distancing measures, without a resurgence of COVID-19. We find that a ""brute-force"" approach of untargeted universal testing requires an average testing rate of once every 36 to 48 hours for every individual, depending on the country. If testing is combined with contact tracing, and/or if tests are able to identify latent infection, then an average rate of once every 4 to 5 days is sufficient.","In this work we present an analysis of the two major strategies currently implemented around the world in the fight against COVID-19: Social distancing & shelter-in-place measures to protect the susceptible, and testing & contact-tracing to identify, isolate and treat the infected.<q>The majority of countries have principally relied on the former; we consider the examples of Italy, Canada and the United States.<q>We demonstrate that in the absence of other measures, scaling back social distancing in such a way as to prevent a second wave will take prohibitively long.

66260,"In this paper, a new Susceptible-Exposed-Symptomatic Infectious-Asymptomatic Infectious-Quarantined-Hospitalized-Recovered-Dead (SEIDIUQHRD) deterministic compartmental model has been proposed and calibrated for describing the transmission dynamics of the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19). A calibration process is executed through the solution of an inverse problem with the help of a Trust-Region-Reflective algorithm, used to determine the best parameter values that would fit the model response. The purpose of this study is to give a tentative prediction of the epidemic peak for Russia, Brazil, India and Bangladesh which could become the next COVID-19 hotspots in no time. Based on the publicly available epidemiological data from late January until 10 May, it has been estimated that the number of daily new symptomatic infectious cases for the above mentioned countries could reach the peak around the beginning of June with the peak size of {approx}15,774 symptomatic infectious cases in Russia, {approx}26,449 cases in Brazil, {approx}9,504 cases in India and {approx}2,209 cases in Bangladesh. Based on our analysis, the estimated value of the basic reproduction number (R0) as of May 11, 2020 was found to be {approx}4.234 in Russia, {approx}5.347 in Brazil, {approx}5.218 in India, {approx}4.649 in the United Kingdom and {approx}3.5 in Bangladesh. Moreover, with an aim to quantify the uncertainty of our model parameters, Latin hypercube sampling-partial rank correlation coefficient (LHS-PRCC) which is a global sensitivity analysis (GSA) method is applied which elucidates that, for Russia, the recovery rate of undetected asymptomatic carriers, the rate of getting home-quarantined or self-quarantined and the transition rate from quarantined class to susceptible class are the most influential parameters, whereas the rate of getting home-quarantined or self-quarantined and the inverse of the COVID-19 incubation period are highly sensitive parameters in Brazil, India, Bangladesh and the United Kingdom which could significantly affect the transmission dynamics of the novel coronavirus. Our analysis also suggests that relaxing social distancing restrictions too quickly could exacerbate the epidemic outbreak in the above mentioned countries.","In this paper, a new Susceptible-Exposed-Symptomatic Infectious-Asymptomatic Infectious-Quarantined-Hospitalized-Recovered-Dead (SEIDIUQHRD) deterministic compartmental model has been proposed and calibrated for describing the transmission dynamics of the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19).<q>A calibration process is executed through the solution of an inverse problem with the help of a Trust-Region-Reflective algorithm, used to determine the best parameter values that would fit the model response.<q>The purpose of this study is to give a tentative prediction of the epidemic peak for Russia, Brazil, India and Bangladesh which could become the next COVID-19 hotspots in no time.

66264,"This study evaluates impact of nation-wide lockdown on COVID-19 cases in ten states of India. At the beginning of the outbreak, states reported high transmissibility and lower doubling time. National lockdown was implemented from 24th March 2020. The effective R0 in several states has come down by the adopted curtailment strategies / lockdown compared to what was estimated at the beginning of the epidemic. As the final epidemics size's relation with R0 is exponential and not linear, this reduction if sustained may considerably decrease the total number of affected persons compared to initial estimates. However, two factors should be considered at this moment. Firstly, effective reproduction numbers (R t ) need to be further reduced in-order to flatten or change the direction of the epidemic curve it may be perceived state-wise variations in its magnitude. Secondly, although the doubling time has increased in relative terms, the epidemic still follows an exponential trajectory and the current daily incidence is much more as compared to beginning of the epidemic. The overall picture suggests the initial success of Indian states to curtail the rise of curve. This reduction can mainly be explained by reduced number of contacts among people owing to movement restrictions. Studies on the impact of lockdown in other countries also reported reduction in reproductive number which translates in to flattening of the curve and delaying of peak. (14) (15) (16) (17) (18) (19) Yet as mentioned earlier, the effective R0 estimations are dynamic and may change over age structure, time and nature of intervention. Continuing nationwide lockdown at this scale and with the same intensity may not be further possible for the government because of collateral implications in long term .Therefore, in the post-lockdown era, it might be a challenge to maintain this path and this may be the period where the absolute burden of the infected persons will be high. (20, 21) There remains a higher reported probability of serious infections (including intensive care) in geriatric population compared to younger adults. (22) This coupled with the higher prevalence of comorbid conditions (~50%) in individuals over 60 years in India may warrant a strategy tailored to this section of population .

66301,"In this study, we computed expected reductions in the effective reproductive number, Rt, under different contact tracing scenarios to quantify the degree to which contact tracing can allow for modification of public health orders and physical distancing restrictions while maintaining containment. To support containment, contact tracing must be implemented in concert with wide-scale community testing and must successfully track a high fraction of infected contacts. Our results indicate that contact tracing will support a partial relaxation of physical distancing measures but not a complete return to levels of contact prior to physical distancing, consistent with prior studies. 14,15 For example, a recent paper estimated that adding contact tracing to self-isolation could reduce Rt by 35-47%, assuming 90% compliance, 16 which is similar to the ranges estimated in our analysis. Testing of asymptomatic contacts would substantially magnify potential benefits by extending the coverage of tracing and potentially contributing to improved efficacy of isolation and quarantine. Another potential benefit of testing asymptomatic contacts, not captured in our model, is that negative test results could reduce the number of people needing to quarantine presumptively or could reduce the duration of quarantine, which might produce positive health and economic impacts. 24 For contact tracing to be most effective, broadening testing guidelines to include asymptomatic contacts will be important once testing capacity bottlenecks are addressed. The benefits of contact tracing also depend substantially on levels of adherence to isolation and quarantine among traced cases, which could be enhanced through policies such as providing voluntary out-of-home accommodations and income replacement. Limitations of this analysis include a simplified modeling framework that lacks network or household structure, and also does not explicitly capture nursing homes, work places, or other potentially high-transmission venues. We furthermore did not model the impact of broader testing of asymptomatic individuals other than traced contacts, which would increase the coverage and impact of a containment strategy. Many uncertainties persist, including the extent of asymptomatic prevalence and transmission. Nevertheless, by examining a range of scenarios that reflect key sources of uncertainty and policy-relevant variables, we provide benchmarks that can aid in developing evidence-based containment strategies to minimize the risk of resurgent COVID-19 spread. .

(1) to (5) with the Julia Programming . CC-BY 4.0   author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity. Language's package DifferentialEquations [28] . Our main result is to show that, even though the current NPI measure taken in Brazil have led to a substantial decrease in the number of infections as compared to no NPI since the beginning of the reported cases in Brazil (see red and blue curves in Fig. 3 (bottom) ), the current measures are not enough to prevent the collapse of the health system in a short period of time with million of infected persons (see Fig. 3 (top) and Fig. 4) . Even with the combination of CSU, HVQ and SD60+ taking place, our model predicts millions of infected individuals, with a peak at the first weeks of May 2020 (see Fig. 3 (top)), and consequently an exponential increase in the demand for ICUs. In fact, as can seen in Fig. 4 , already at the end of April we will surpass the current capacity of ICUs. The health system is still under treat in the current scenario, indicated to collapse by the end of Abril, 2020 (around 30 days after t0 == March 21, 2020), vigorously crossing the 5500 ICUs barrier. Moreover, the scenario is even worse if the imposed NPIs are relaxed (as being constantly debated by the Brazilian federal government), pointing out tens of millions of infected individuals, see black curve in Fig. 3 (bottom) . On the positive side, we have also identified a window of 25 days -from the March 21st to April 16th -in which, similarly to what has been done in China, if more severe control measures are be applied, one can control the virus spread and keep the ICU demand below the threshold (see the green curve in Fig. 4) . Given that the actual NPI scenario in Brazil is represented by the combination of the lowest values of the g i functions in Table II for CSU, SD60+ and VHQ, the only possible measure is an intense quarantine (last column of Table  II) . Except a intense quarantine, all the other scenarios are more catastrophic, meaning a faster collapse of the system. Although an emergence expansion and/or other measures can be tried, it is unlikely to keep the pace with the exponential spread of the infection. Even if we are underestimating the number of available ICUs, the saturation will still take place for the current scenario (as it shows a positive concavity), being only reversed with the intense quarantine implementation. In our model, this intense quarantine is supposed to be applied around 20 days after our initial time (March, 21) . As discussed in the NPI section, no measure is instantaneous efficient, taking on average a time t β ≈ 14 days to be completely noticed [21] . In spite of that, notice that the increase in the ICU demand is rapidly contained. Moreover, it is important to mention that such a intense quarantine should last enough time until we reach a plateau in the ICU demand. Not only the quarantine protects the health system, but also corresponds to a minimization of the number of deaths, massively reducing it. In Tables V and VI, we show the estimated number of infected people and deaths, respectively, in the current scenario as well as if other NPI measures start to take place at April 11th (20 days after March 21st). Observe how the total of infected is still very high in the current scenario: around 3.15 million infected individual, with an astonishing 393 thousands deaths. As discussed, the only scenario which considerably reduces the number of infected persons and deaths is an intense quarantine. It reduces to 34.5 thousand infections and 1300 deaths. In particular, we notice that changing the current NPI to SD60+ (f social distancing of people above 60 years old) as been currently discussed by the Brazilian federal government, is completely catastrophic. As this group corresponds to the majority of critical care demands and deaths, their isolation is certainly necessary. However, taken alone it leads to ≈ 27 millions infected and 723 thousand dead individuals (see the fifth columns in Tables V and VI). An important observation is that our . CC-BY 4.0   author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity. is the (which was not peer-reviewed)  In addition, our model can be applied to other countries or regions with minimal adaptation, since it will require only updates in Tables I -III . Finally, although we have employed many data-driven assumptions, the results presented here may still underestimate the threat to the national health system due to the particular social problems in Brazil, such as: (i) high level of cardiopathologies, a reported relevant comorbidity; (ii) considerable number of people without proper water and wasting supplies; (iii) large number of people living in the same house in peripheral zones due to housing deficit, (iv) high density of obesity cases and some other immune suppressant diseases, just to cite a few. On the positive side, there can be a potential defense against SARS-Cov-2 for those BCG-vaccinated [29] , which belongs to the universal vaccination program in Brazil [30] . Furthermore, the public health system in Brazil has great capillarity, in principle being capable to identify potential cases in the very beginning of the symptoms. However, that also requires widespread clinical tests to identify infected individuals. In this work we proposed a data-driven age-structured census-based SIRD-like epidemiological model capable of forecasting the spread of COVID-19 in Brazil in a number of NPI scenarios. We remark that our approach is fairly general and thus can be applied to treat particular regions or cities, if the required data is available. As we have shown, the early NPI measures taken by states and cities such as the total closure of schools, universities and non-essential services, the social distancing and isolation of individuals above 60 years and the voluntary home quarantine have already lead to significant reduction in the number of infections as well as delaying the time for the peak of contamination. Thus, these measures have been extremely important to give the authorities the necessary time for the adapting and preparing before the peak of the epidemy. Notwithstanding, the current measures are not enough. Our model predicts that even if the current NPIs are not relaxed, as early as mid April the number of severe cases requiring hospitalization will surpass the current number of available ICUs, starting the collapse of the health system. However, a intense quarantine, if implemented in the following days, can rapidly change the increase in the number of infections and keep the demand for ICUs below the threshold, amounting to hundred of thousands of saved lives. On the other hand, we demonstrate that the relaxation of the already imposed control measures in the next days, as currently debated at some sphere of the Brazilian federal government, would be catastrophic, with a total death toll passing the one million mark. In a nutshell, a continued quarantine, tighter than the current one and with a duration of a couple of weeks, is most likely the only solution to avoid the collapse of the health systems in Brazil. We hope that the gigantic difference in numbers, showing how different measures can lead to a reduction in infections and deaths of the order of hundreds of thousands or even millions, can provide a rational guide for the future decisions by the competent authorities. author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity. is the (which was not peer-reviewed)    ","3 (bottom) ), the current measures are not enough to prevent the collapse of the health system in a short period of time with million of infected persons (see Fig.<q>3 (top)), and consequently an exponential increase in the demand for ICUs.<q>With the model initialized and callibrated as described in the previous section, we obtain the results by solving the system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) given by Eqs.

66392,"Using a model of setting-specific interactions, we estimated that strategies that combined isolation of symptomatic cases and tracing of their contacts reduced the effective reproduction number more than mass testing or self-isolation alone. The effectiveness of these isolation and tracing strategies was further enhanced when combined with physical distancing measures, such as a reduction in work contacts, or a limit to the number of contacts made outside of home, school or work settings. Several countries have achieved a prolonged suppression of SARS-CoV-2 transmission using a combination of case isolation, contact tracing and physical distancing.

Overall, all mental health outcomes worsened from Time 1 to time 2, although there was a significant gender x time interaction for stress. 9.7% of the sample reported stress above the clinical cut-off (2 SD above mean), while 8.0% and 9.4% were above this cutoff for depression and anxiety, respectively. In repeated measures analysis, female gender, worsening diet and excess of COVID-19 information was related to all mental health outcomes. Changes in diet for the worse were associated with increases in anxiety. Exercise frequency was clearly related to state anxiety (0 days/week > 6 days/week). Those who did aerobic exercise did not have any increase in depression. Use of tele-psychotherapy predicted lower levels of depression and anxiety. In multiple regression, anxiety was predicted by the greatest number of COVID-19 specific factors. In conclusion, mental health outcomes worsened for Brazilians during the first month of quarantine and these changes are associated with a variety of risk factors.","The 2020 COVID-19 pandemic is a crisis of global proportions with a significant impact on the country of Brazil.<q>The aims of this investigation were to track changes and risk factors for mental health outcomes during state-mandated quarantine.<q>Adults residing in Brazil (n = 360, 37.

66480,"According to the COVID-19 data tracking, these 8 countries have delayed the phase of preventing the epidemic and have indeed entered the outbreak phase with community-spread cases. Mortality rate analysis disclosed that undetected transmission events may have occurred in some countries. Seven of the eight countries have R0 levels above 3, which deserves our attention. The high mortality was reported because the main reason for undetected transmission is probably that some of the cases are asymptomatic or lack testing kits. Our Scenario 2 and Scenario 3 are separately based on maximal assumption (without any interventions) and minimal assumption (with strict interventions). In Scenario 3, under the assumption that infected people are promptly tested and counted, the adjusted model suggested that the peak time will be reached after the strict implementation of two large-scale rounds of 14 days of quarantine. The decrease in the epidemic size in Japan and South Korea showed positive evidence, as shown in Table 1 . However, considering that each country has different cultures and healthcare situations and that the implementation of the policies and control measures are at different levels 21 , the actual situation of those countries should be between Scenario 2 and Scenario 3. It is worth pointing out that, compared with implementing no interventions, if governments take strict control measures to reduce the movement of the population and implement prompt diagnosis and isolation, the peak time will be reached, and the peak size would greatly decrease to a relatively low level in approximately 30 days; it is best triggered in the early stage of the epidemic; however, it will need to be maintained for several months until a vaccine becomes available. Conversely, as long . CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0   author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity. is the (which was not peer-reviewed)    as the epidemic continues, there is still a possibility of future outbreaks if governments loosen interventions and allow people to return to close social distances. The results of spreading potentials show that the R 0 of COVID-19 is high, which is similar to that of SARS viruses (R 0 values between 2.0 and 5.0 22 ), higher influenza viruses H1N1 (R 0 values between 1.2 and 3.7 23 ), and Ebola viruses (R 0 values between 1.34 and 3.65 24 ). COVID-19 is a highly contagious human-to-human transmission disease. The R 0 is expected to decrease substantially compared to values at the early stage after governments implement control measures; however, regardless of the kind of policy each country executes, each policy has its limitations in defending against COVID-19, and sustained transmission chains will occur until there is a vaccine or the until the virus disappears due to seasonal or population immunity 25 From the view of mathematical models, the SEIR model is designed for infectious disease estimation; however, the logistic growth model is designed to fit the development of the curves. The logistic model may fit the existing data better when compared with the SEIR model, since it is trained from the existing data, but it cannot be accurately judged and incorporates infectious characteristics. Therefore, we believe that the logistic model is better for near-term predictions. On the other hand, the SEIR model introduces more variables and factors by considering the interaction and association among multiple groups of people, and it is more reasonable than the logistic model as it follows the rules of infectious disease development, but the prediction results vary greatly with respect to different interventions and settings. The study has some limitations. The mathematical models allow for the quick incorporation of multiple inputs to yield prediction results. However, this process involves making assumptions about uncertain factors; for example, it is difficult to determine the exact extent to which people follow the local government's quarantine policies or measures and engage in behaviors such as washing hands, using masks, and social distancing. This may affect the actual contact rate and the subsequent development of the epidemic. The models also lack enough data to estimate the quarantine proportions of a certain population. In fact, the evolution of the epidemic is quite . CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0   author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity. is the (which was not peer-reviewed)    complicated, and our study has only taken into account a few factors. In addition, a lack of testing kits means many cases have not been tested in some countries, and without robust testing, the official number of cases is incomplete. When working with incomplete data, a small error in one factor can have an outsize effect. In conclusion, our study demonstrated that reducing the contact rate is a key measure in controlling the spread of disease at an early stage, and spending enough time in quarantine would decrease the scale of cases after the peak. Therefore, implementing strong containment policies during the early spreading stages of COVID-19 and flattening the peak to avoid overloading the healthcare system should be listed as the main actions in these high-risk countries/regions. After the strict quarantine period, governments still need to raise public awareness of precautions and the importance of engaging in self-protective behaviors to bring the epidemic under control as a series of scattered events. .

66491,"In this paper, using an epidemic model coupled with statistical regression models we quantitatively explored the time series of infection spread in different countries for the COVID19 outbreak and its relation with quarantine measures as well as medical infrastructure. The reproduction numbers of this pandemic are found to be comparable to the SARS-cov values [22, 23] and much higher than the MERS infection [24, 25] . We employed the mathematical model and fitted the confirmed, recovered and dead population trajectories from 23 countries where the countries are a combination of early, mid and late stage infections for the first wave of COVID19 infection. The fitted mathematical models display large variabilities in the infection rate among countries as well as the reduction in their infection rates over time, primarily, due to implementation of the social distancing measures. We show that the variabilities can be correlated to some extent by disparate healthcare infrastructure. In the European countries, the infection has spread faster either due to strong airline connection with Wuhan or due to the cold climate but they could control the reproduction number( ) with R 0 time and the first wave of infection is almost over for many such countries (Figure 4 ). The lockdown measure to implement social distancing which is implemented in almost every country infected with COVID19, is a necessary measure to reduce the infection spread, but how well a country is sampling its population for testing and further how well they quarantine the infected population are also important factors during the lockdown. Lockdown is a preparatory measure for the health care system to reorganize itself to deal with the situation since long term lock down would be detrimental to the economy of any country [26] . .

66499,"We have presented a mathematically simple framework for the study of the effects of public interventions in specific countries, regions or cities based on a SIQR model. Remarkably, we show that for all analyzed countries our model can effectively estimate the date in which the measures started being effective, thus allowing to assess the efficacy of the interventions put in place by the different governments and the response of the populations. Interestingly the regions that have lowered the growth rate to zero have imposed relatively mild restrictions. In New South Wales schools are not closed, but parents were invited to keep their children at home on March 23, 2020. This date coincides almost perfectly with our estimated date-of-change, suggesting that this invitation has been followed, and has had immediate effect. Indirect effects likely contribute: keeping children at home often means that their parent will work from home, and in addition, the increased awareness of the situation following such an invitation may have wider, general effects, as might be expected to have occurred in N.S.W. Similarly, B.C. has not imposed lockdown, although schools were closed on March 18, 2020 (in agreement with our estimated date-of-change) and restaurants are only allowed to sell take-away food. Switzerland, in spite of its closeness to Italy, has managed to contain COVID-19 without a strict lockdown as seen in Italy. In Switzerland, schools closed on March 16, 2020, and a partial lockdown involving closure of bars, shops and other gathering places, but leaving open certain essentials, such as grocery stores, pharmacies, (a reduced) public transport and the postal service, was imposed from March 17, 2020. We estimate that these interventions had effect on the COVID-19 transmission rate within a few days. Our analysis of Germany and Austria in many aspects mimic Switzerland, except that for Germany the growth rate is still positive (R 0 > 1). Our estimated date-of-change coincides with the dates of school closures and partial lockdown. Most German federal states closed schools from March 16, 2020 followed by the remaining country from March 18, 2020 -one day before our estimated date of change. The German government imposed partial lockdown from March 17, closing all non-essential shops, and imposing limitation restaurants and banning leisure activities, which was followed by further restrictions in the following days. On March 16 the government of Austria prohibited gatherings of groups of more than five people in public, and all schools were closed from March 17. On this latter date, the closure of restaurants was also ordered. People were recommended to leave home only for purchasing necessary goods (medications, groceries), for assisting other people, or 5 .

66525,"The results show a generally strong correlation between strengthening of the quarantine controls, i.e. increasing Q(t) as learnt by the neural network model; actions taken by the regions' respective governments; and decrease of the effective reproduction number R t . For example, in Italy, government restrictions reportedly (Ghiglione et al. 2020) tightened during the week preceding mid March, which is also when our model shows a sharp increase in Q(t) and corresponding decrease in R t (figures 4b, c). For Wuhan and South Korea, similar cusps in government interventions took place earlier, in the weeks leading to and after the end of January (Cyranoski 2020) and February, respectively (Normille 2020) . These cusps were also captured well by our model (Figures 2b, c and  6b , c, respectively). Even for the USA, Q(t) shows a stagnation till 20 March 2020, after which it shows a sharp increase accompanied with a decrease in R t (Figures 8b, c) , which is in alignment with the ramping up of government policies and quarantine interventions post mid March in the worst affected states like New York, New Jersey, California, and Michigan. is the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the (which was not peer-reviewed)    A comparative analysis of the quarantine strength function Q(t) learned by the neural network for different countries reveals that Wuhan had the highest magnitude and South Korea had the highest growth rate of Q(t). This can be attributed to the stringent government interventions and strict public health measures including immediate isolation and quarantine impositions in Wuhan and South Korea. This eventually resulted in the halting of infection spread and a corresponding R t < 1 within a month for Wuhan ( Figure  2c ) and within 20 days for South Korea (figure 6c) after the first signs of a pandemic were recognized. It is reported that the infected case count stagnated nation-wide in China by the beginning of March (Cyranoski 2020 ) and in South Korea by the end of March (Fisher & Sang-Hun 2020) ; which eventually led to a stagnation in the quarantine interventions employed in these countries. This is in general qualitative agreement with our forecasting results which show a plateau in Q(t) and R t at R t < 1: Figures 3a,b and 7a ,b. In Italy, as of March 20 th , I(t) is appearing to be linear (Figure 4a) , which is consistent with lower rates of infections being actually reported (Horowitz & Kirkpatrick 2020) and can be taken as a precursor to stagnation. It is also consistent with adoption of strict movement restrictions by the government shortly before the March 20 th date. We forecast that, for Italy, R t will drop below 1 and Q(t), R t both will stagnate between mid to end of April 2020 (Figure 5a , b) indicating halting of the spread of infection. Owing to the relaxed quarantine and isolation policies in the US in its initial stages post the infection spread, our model converges to Q(t) ≈ 0.4 − 0.6 ( Figure 8b ) which is the smallest compared to other regions. Even though the effective R t is still greater than 1 as of April 1 2020 (Figure 8c ), its growth has started to show a decreasing trend and we expect the infection to start showing stagnation with R t < 1 by 20 April 2020 if the current US policies continue without change (Figures 9b, 10a ). This will be accompanied by a continuous ramp up of quarantine policies (Figure 9a ). At its peak, we forecast the infected count to reach approximately 600,000 before stagnation, again assuming no change in US policies. Our mixed model analysis for USA, employing Q(t) learnt from the models of Wuhan, Italy and South Korea in the USA model starting from 1 April 2020, reveals that stronger quarantine policies (Figure 10b ) might lead to an accelerated plateauing in the infected case count, as shown in Figure 10a , and subsequently smaller infected case count. On the other hand, in agreement with National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases estimates (Miller 2020) , we forecast that relaxing or abandoning the quarantine policies gradually over the period of the next 17 days may well lead to ∼ 1 million infections without any stagnation in the infected case count (Figure 10a ) by mid April 2020.

66555,"When actively taking measures to control an epidemic, an important indicator of success is crossing the ""peak"" of daily new infections. The peak is a positive sign which marks the end of the exponential phase of infection spread and a transition into a phase that is a manageable. Most countries or provinces with similar but independent growth trajectories had taken drastic measures for containing the COVID-19 pandemic and are eagerly waiting to cross the peak. However, the data after many weeks of strict measures suggests that most provinces instead enter a phase where the infections are in a linear growth. While the transition out of an exponential phase is relieving, the roughly constant number of daily new infections differ widely, range from around 50 in Singapore to around 2000 just in Lombardy (Italy), and 7600 in Spain. The daily new infection rate of a region seems to depend heavily on the time point in the exponential evolution when the restrictive measures were adopted, rather than on the population of the region. It is not easy to point the critical source of these persistent infections. We attempt to interpret this data using a simple model of newer infections mediated by asymptomatic patients, which underscores the importance of actively identifying any potential leakages in the quarantine. Given the novelty of the virus, it is hard to predict too far into the future and one needs to be observant to see if a plan B is needed as a second round of interventions. So far, the peak achieved by most countries with the first round of intervention is extremely flat.","When actively taking measures to control an epidemic, an important indicator of success is crossing the ""peak"" of daily new infections.<q>The peak is a positive sign which marks the end of the exponential phase of infection spread and a transition into a phase that is a manageable.<q>Most countries or provinces with similar but independent growth trajectories had taken drastic measures for containing the COVID-19 pandemic and are eagerly waiting to cross the peak.

The rate of severe illness and death were low, whereas some patients had longer incubation period. We, therefore, recommend prolonging the quarantine period to three weeks when necessary. All patients with positive real-time RT-PCR results had significant clinical symptoms and radiological features, which suggests we could use a combination of real-time RT-PCR, chest CT scans and clinical manifestations on admission to increase the diagnostic accuracy. Sensitivity of three rounds of real-time RT-PCR together with two rounds of chest CT scans was higher compared with other diagnostic methods.

66750,"In this study, we have used a Flow-SEIR model to numerically estimate the efficacy of the quarantine and traffic blockage. We introduced both the the quarantine factor and the traffic blockage factor, then the flow variable and transmission rate in the model will vary as the change of these two intervation factors, then the effectiveness of the traffic blockage and quarantine can be simulated and evaluated. In the simulated results, we conclude that if the masses take protective measures, the peak number of cases will decrease greatly by 89.68%. However, if the masses completely ignored self-isolation, the peak is predicted to increase by 20.40%. And if the external population flows to the target area is almost completely blocked, the peak number will decrease by 21.06%-22.38%. Earlier warning, timely traffic blockage and quarantine measures are extremely effective, especially for areas with slight epidemic situations. The experimental results also show that if there is one day earlier of traffic blockage, about 3,600 cases will eventually be reduced in the mainland China, and one day delay will result in additional 1,800 cases at risk. Applying the latest migration population data from Baidu Migration, and varying the traffic blockage factor, we can use the Flow-SEIR model to simulate the number of infections and then intuitively understand the efficacy of the traffic blockage. However, our study has several major limitations. First, the accuracy of results can be improved provided the source of data is more reliable and sufficient. Since in Hubei the medical resources are overburdened and the methods to diagnose the COVID-9 are not accurate, even the diagnosis changed several times, the underdiagnosis and misdiagnosis are invetiable, then the confirmed cases are underestimated. Secondly, there is heterogenity in transmission, it is not added in our study, and we also did not district the age distribution in our model. The study has numerically estimated the efficacy of traffic blockage and quarantine. We confirm by simulated quantification evidence that the traffic blockage is effective in controlling the epidemic of COVID-19, and the quarantine is a more effective way to help the public to prevent cross-infection. With the development of the epidemic, we have to admit the fact that there are still a number of population who are exposed to the COVID-19 without clinical symptoms [18] [19] [20] . Those population may carry the COVID-19 for several days and might infect others who are closely contacting with, which makes the potentional risk.

We used ARIMA model and Auto ARIMA model on the time series data of COVID-19 cases in West Bengal for forecasting the total confirmed and active cases till August end. Based on the forecasts, confirmed cases for West Bengal at the end of June are expected to be 17838-18724 (95% CI: 128806, 227968).

However, the actual numbers can go higher than our estimates of confirmed cases, active cases & trends we made based on the data till June 3rd in this forecast, when West Bengal observed complete lockdown. Currently, West Bengal has a partial lockdown or Following Unlock 1.0 with restrictions varying for three zones (red, orange and green zone) based on the current assessment of the situation in there. Lockdown is getting lifted, and in this case, there will be a surge in the number of daily confirmed and active cases. The requirement of isolation beds, ICUs and ventilators will also be increased in that scenario. The migrants are returning to their homes due to loss of livelihood and income in the lockdown period, which may lead to a rise in the number of cases, and could not be accounted for, in our projections. So, India and its majorly affected states like Maharashtra, Gujarat, Tamil Nadu and Delhi & West Bengal need to be well prepared for the pandemic challenge in coming time and focus on increasing their healthcare infrastructure, and other states should also remain alert till the pandemic completely recedes.

66900,"Background The ability of global health systems to cope with increasing numbers of COVID-19 cases is of major concern. In readiness for this challenge, Australia has drawn on clinical pathway models developed over many years in preparation for influenza pandemics. These models have been used to estimate health care requirements for COVID-19 patients, in the context of broader public health measures. Methods An age and risk stratified transmission model of COVID-19 infection was used to simulate an unmitigated epidemic with parameter ranges reflecting uncertainty in current estimates of transmissibility and severity. Overlaid public health measures included case isolation and quarantine of contacts, and broadly applied social distancing. Clinical presentations and patient flows through the Australian health care system were simulated, including expansion of available intensive care capacity and alternative clinical assessment pathways. Findings An unmitigated COVID-19 epidemic would dramatically exceed the capacity of the Australian health system, over a prolonged period. Case isolation and contact quarantine alone will be insufficient to constrain case presentations within a feasible level of expansion of health sector capacity. Overlaid social restrictions will need to be applied at some level over the course of the epidemic to ensure that systems do not become overwhelmed, and that essential health sector functions, including care of COVID-19 patients, can be maintained. Attention to the full pathway of clinical care is needed to ensure access to critical care. Interpretation Reducing COVID-19 morbidity and mortality will rely on a combination of measures to strengthen and extend public health and clinical capacity, along with reduction of overall infection transmission in the community. Ongoing attention to maintaining and strengthening the capacity of health care systems and workers to manage cases is needed.","Background The ability of global health systems to cope with increasing numbers of COVID-19 cases is of major concern.<q>Overlaid public health measures included case isolation and quarantine of contacts, and broadly applied social distancing.<q>Clinical presentations and patient flows through the Australian health care system were simulated, including expansion of available intensive care capacity and alternative clinical assessment pathways.

66939,"This analysis does support the assertion that a bad test is worse than no tests, but a good test is only effective in a carefully designed strategy. More is not necessarily better and over estimation of the test accuracy could be extremely detrimental.

66963,"On January 23, 2020, China imposed a quarantine on the city of Wuhan to contain the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak. Regardless of this measure the new infection has spread to several countries around the world. Here, we developed a method to study the dissemination of this infection by the airline routes and we give estimations of the time of arrival of the outbreaks to the different cities. In this work we show an analysis of the dispersion of this infection to other cities by airlines based on the classic model the Kermack and McKendrick complemented with diffusion on a graph composed of nodes which represent the cities and edges which represent the airline routes. We do several numerical simulations to estimate the date of arrival to different cities starting the infection at Wuhan, China and to show the robustness of the estimation respect to changes in the epidemiological parameters and to changes on the graph. We use Mexico City as an example. In this case, our estimate of the arrival time is between March 20 and March 30, 2020. This analysis is limited to the analysis of dispersion by airlines, so this estimate should be taken as an overestimate since the infection can arrive by other means. This model estimates the arrival of the infectious outbreak to Mexico between March 20 and March 30. This estimation gives a time period to implement and strengthen preventive measures aimed at the general population, as well as to strengthen hospital infrastructure and training of human resources in health.","On January 23, 2020, China imposed a quarantine on the city of Wuhan to contain the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak.<q>Regardless of this measure the new infection has spread to several countries around the world.<q>Here, we developed a method to study the dissemination of this infection by the airline routes and we give estimations of the time of arrival of the outbreaks to the different cities.

To this end, messaging strategies invoking altruistic behaviour by, for example, Another pattern that we find is conditional cooperation in a social dilemma situation (see the seminal paper of Fehr et al.

Our results suggest narratives do not affect uptake, in line with Nyhan et al. (2013 Nyhan et al. ( , 2014 .

The first coronavirus case in India was confirmed in Kerala's Trissur district on January 30, 2020. Ever since, the state has been fighting the pandemic in an exemplary manner. The steps were simple but proactive. The equation for Kerala's success has been simple, prioritized testing, widespread contact tracing, and promoting social distance. Besides that two factors fuelled this success, the 'formidable' grass root level primary health care system and the experience it gleaned in the last two years when it handled another deadly virus outbreak (2018 Nipah virus outbreak in Kerala). State announces its strategy is trace, quarantine, test, isolate and treat in the beginning only. The state soon began implementing mandatory quarantines for visitors arriving from abroad and from outside of the state, weeks before the Centre instituted similar measures across the country. They also imposed uncompromising controls, were supported by an excellent healthcare system, government accountability, transparency, public trust, civil rights and importantly the decentralized governance and strong grass-root level institutions.

67139,"We use the infection probability estimates for Quezon City (QC), in the Philippines, with an age distribution as shown in Table  1 . This high estimate may be explained by sampling bias, wherein severe cases may have been overrepresented because of lack of testing. Those who are infectious but are asymptomatic or who exhibit mild symptoms should also be equally represented in the testing guidelines (at the moment, they are not); not to mention those who were infectious with no symptoms and have recovered. We tried Martinez' calculations using CFR, which was reported at 2.3% for China [1] . This gave a much lower number of around 2,857 deaths, for a Quezon City CFR of 0.89%. This figure is surprisingly low, compared to the 6.94% projected using the estimated infection probability. The delay in test reporting (est. 5-7 days [8] ) factors in the estimation of the initial E-I-R values. In addition this delay is compounded by the incubation period and, in our opinion, moves the quarantine effect further down from the actual date of implementation (March 15 th ). We started Q-SEIR simulation on March 20, 2020 with no quarantine assumed because the steep jump in cases occurred on this date; 60% effective quarantine was set for April 2 nd . A portion of the worksheet is shown (Table  2) , with the quarantine parameter in the second column. The model was grounded to the estimated number of exposed individuals at the national level on April 1, 2020 (N=7400) [9] . From the nationally reported number of exposed individuals (PUI+PUM), Quezon City represents almost 10% (~740). Q-SEIR predicted 705. The model predicted 14.00% of the population will be infectious (I) at the peak. The two methods now give us a low and high estimate for Quezon City: Infectious individuals will peak between 9.95 (from Age Stratification) and 14.00% (from Q-SEIR) of the population, around the third week of May.

67173,"There is of course the limitation here that although pandemic influenza is a respiratory virus like SARS-CoV-2, these two agents might still have different transmission dynamics in the aircraft cabin setting. Another issue is that the in-flight influenza outbreaks in the systematic review did suffer from incomplete contact tracing (mean of 73% traced, median of 86% traced), and so the true burden of secondary cases is probably somewhat higher for these outbreaks. But countering this is the possibility that there might have been publication bias involved, given that in this review there were only 4/19 studies with zero secondary cases. This might suggest that large in-flight outbreaks of influenza were more likely to be studied (and published on) than those with no or little secondary spread.

67182,"A six compartmental model for the transmission dynamics of COVID-19 with quarantine, isolation and awareness as time-dependent control measures is examined using the work of Gumel et al. [14] as a guide. The model is for human-human transmission that involves imported cases and community spread. The model is proven to have an invariant region. This region is where the model is well-posed and makes biological sense to be carried out for the human population. The basic reproduction number, 0 , is 1.51 when none of the exposed individuals are quarantined compared to when all of the exposed individuals are quarantined, 0 = 0.76. This means that a single infected person can transmit the infection to approximately two other persons when there is no quarantine while there is a possibility of stopping further transmission of infection when quarantine is implemented. However, there is a chance that some of the exposed individuals will evade quarantine due to fear of stigmatization and death. Therefore, public health education/awareness will help to correct their misconceptions and encourage them to accept the control measures. Furthermore, people that recovered need to share their experiences in quarantine and isolation centres with members of their community to enlist the cooperation of the entire community. When there is no isolation of the infected not hospitalized individuals in the population, the basic reproduction number, 0 = 2.5. This means that one infected not hospitalized person will infect approximately three persons in the population. The presence of isolation will help to reduce the number of infected not hospitalized individuals in the population. The simultaneous implementation of the three interventions reduces the number of infected individuals compared to the implementation of two interventions in the infected population (Figure 3a) . This implementation takes about 64% input of awareness for 80 days, 58% input of quarantine for 95 days and 100% input of isolation for 98 days before they drop slowly to their lower bound (see Figure 4a ). This does not achieve zero infection in the population which implies that more interventions are needed to eradicate the virus. On the other hand, the combined implementation of public health education and quarantine measures produces a better result for the exposed population (Figure 3b) . It takes about 100% input of public health education for 90 days and 100% input of quarantine for 95 days to trace 2000 contacts in the exposed population (Figure 4b ). It means that public health education/awareness should reach all the hooks and corners of the population. People need to be aware of the virus and also the creation of adequate awareness of COVID-19 among the population will facilitate contact tracing and quarantine of high-risk individuals. It will also help to identify those who do not qualify for quarantine but tested positive for COVID-19 to be isolated. This will reduce further transmission of COVID-19 in the population. . CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0    In this paper, a new deterministic mathematical model of COVID-19 was formulated with quarantine, isolation and public health education as interventions. The model was also used as a prototyped to extensively investigate the contributions of these control measures to ascertain their individual and combined contributions in curbing the transmission and spread of COVID-19. The model analyses include the establishment of the Invariant region and positivity of the model, the existence of disease-free equilibrium, and computation of the basic reproduction number R0. It was found that the basic reproduction number, 0 , is 1.51 when none of the exposed individuals are quarantined compared to when all of the exposed individuals are quarantined, 0 = 0.76. This means that a single infected person can transmit the infection to approximately two other persons when there is no quarantine while there is a possibility of stopping further transmission of infection when there is quarantine. It was also shown that when there is no isolation of the infected not hospitalized individuals in the population, the basic reproduction number, 0 = 2.5. This means that one infected not hospitalized person will infect approximately three persons in the population. The presence of isolation will help to reduce the number of infected not hospitalized individuals in the population. The simultaneous implementation of the three interventions reduces the number of infected individuals compared to the implementation of two interventions in the infected population. Furthermore, it was observed that the time-dependent interventions reduce the number of exposed and infected individuals compared to time-independent interventions. With the interventions such as quarantine, isolation and public health education, the number of exposed and infected individuals will reduce drastically within a short time but not to zero, leaving a residue of infected individuals with the potential to cause a further outbreak. This implies that COVID-19 will not be eradicated even with the timely implementation of these interventions. Recommendation: Governments should ensure prompt implementation of quarantine, isolation and public health education in the COVID-19 fight in order to suppress its infectivity and mitigate the disease burden. Further Research: Incorporation of mass testing and/or vaccination in the current model to ascertain its potential to eradicate COVID-19 in the population. . CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0    ()  .

67185,"We find that unmitigated transmission of Covid-19 in a population of 30,000 staff, faculty and students would lead to hundreds of illnesses, many hospitalizations and likely some deaths in this population, which would be an unacceptable outcome by administrators and the university community. A testing strategy whereby symptomatic students, staff and faculty are identified, administered viral testing, and isolated is effective at controlling transmission. We find that the success of this strategy relies on contact tracing and quarantining most contacts of infected individuals. Screening would have to be performed at least monthly to have much of an impact on the course of the outbreak on campus and increases the sample collection and assay requirements considerably. Overall, we recommend that these results be interpreted qualitatively, since there is considerable uncertainty in these projections stemming from lack of precision of parameter inputs (e.g. true R0 in this population). There are a number of limitations to this modeling analysis, which we outline here. First, we do not make any assumptions about the efficacy of any prevention and control measures aside from testing that are implemented on campus for Fall 2020. Smaller class sizes, staggered class times, use of face coverings, use of other protective equipment and general behavior change are not explicitly accommodated in this model. (16) In that sense, our results are conservative in that we may overestimate risk. We suggest that this is an appropriate baseline scenario for risk-averse planning. Moving more students to off-campus housing has little effect on our projections because we make the assumption that transmission on-campus (R0 = 3.5) is only moderately higher than off campus (R0 = 2.5). This assumption is based on risk factor data on influenza-like illness among students during the 2009 H1N1 outbreak, but if more data become available, we could revisit this assumption. (17) In our model, the campus outbreak cannot go extinct because we assume a constant rate of introduction from the community. Depending on levels of student, staff and faculty behavior off-campus and the general prevalence in the surrounding community (Atlanta metro area in our model), this could be an under-or overestimate of risk. We have not explicitly included a scenario in which all or a subset of students (e.g.., those residing on campus) are screened upon return to campus. Given our assumptions that student prevalence is the same as among the general population, screening on return would have limited effect, but would increase requirements by ~4,500 to 15,000 tests, depending on the breadth of testing of the student body. Finally, we have not included seasonal effects whereby virus becomes more transmissible in Fall or alternative semester dates (e.g.., end of classes at Thanksgiving break) whereby the period of campus transmission is reduced. In conclusion, we present a model of SARS-CoV-2 transmission and control to assist universities in planning potential impacts and resource needs. Our model is conservative in that we assume a high reproductive number that is not reduced through non-pharmaceutical interventions. Despite this, we find that community-introduction of SARS-CoV-2 infection onto campus can be controlled with effective testing, isolation, contract tracing and quarantine, consistent with observations that this strategy has been successful in the general population where implemented properly (e.g. South Korea). (18) The results of this model simulation approach have been influential in Emory University's decision to open in Fall 2020. The University will implement a comprehensive testing strategy and will shorten the semester with an early start, with no breaks in order to end by Thanksgiving, amongst a number of other strategies to suppress transmission. 8% )(4 = 8% )(4 .

67270,"The experience gained during the first wave of the Covid-19 pandemic in winter and spring of 2020 could help countries to better prepare for the next wave, which is expected to take place in autumn of the same year. We proposed the simplified approach, which allows to estimate effectiveness of the imposed quarantine conditions/restrictions, to forecast the epidemic spread and to take appropriate decisions. The observed dynamics of pandemic in various countries shows that the growth rate of new infection cases linearly decreases when the quarantine is imposed in a country (or a region) until it reaches constant value, which corresponds to the effectiveness of quarantine measures taken in the country. The proposed parameters and together with analysis of the population mobility and social contacts can be used to estimate effectiveness of country or region lockdown measures; and on the basis of these parameters, the countries experiencing ongoing epidemic can use the proposed approach to study effectiveness of taken measures in other countries yet affected by the Covid-19 disease. The proposed approach has limitation because it cannot be applied directly for countries with large population size, which might have several epidemic clusters due heterogeneous population distribution. In this case, each cluster must be analysed separately. On the basis of the proposed approach, more complex models can be developed. . CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0    ()  .

67363,"The first confirmed case of SARS-COV-2 in Saudi Arabia was on March 2 nd , 2020, for a Saudi traveler who came back from Iran. In response to the COVID19 pandemic, Saudi Arabia was one of the first countries that applied early and very strict mitigation measures while the number of confirmed cases was still low (300 cases) 8 . On March 15 th , 2020, the Saudi CDC (Weqaya) imposed a new regulation for all travelers coming from outside the kingdom, which is to be quarantined for 14 days in a designated facility regardless of the presence or absence of symptoms. This regulation has helped us to better understand the prevalence of SARS-COV-2 infection in asymptomatic patients. In our cohort, the majority of residents were either truly asymptomatic (54%) or had mild symptoms (46%). The proportion of asymptomatic carriers in our cohort is considered to be one of the highest reported so far.

Our findings could help the officials to take strong and effective measures to contain the spread of COVID-19 and to the prediction of the epidemic trend. We estimated the mean incubation period of COVID-19 infections to be 4.9 days, which was calculated based on a big sample size with valid data. Most importantly, the exposure time interval of the 106 cases selected in our study was no more than three days, and 82.1% of the cases had an exposure time of 1-2 days, which enabled .

Li et al. 17 reported that the incubation period of the new coronavirus was 5.2 days (95% CI, 4.1 to 7.0) with the 95th percentile at 12.5 days according to the early cases with illness onset exposed to the Huanan seafood wholesale market. The authors deemed that this estimation was somewhat imprecise because it was based on the information of only 10 cases. 17 Backer et al. 14 included cases ranged from one day to more than two weeks, and more than 75% of the cases in the two studies had the exposure time more than three days, which might induce bias in the estimates and cause the estimated incubation period longer than the actual length. In addition, our estimates of incubation period were consistent with the results reported by Guan et al. 19 that they estimated the mean incubation period less than five days from the data of 1099 confirmed patients in mainland China. We observed the mean serial interval was 4.1 days for COVID-19, which is shorter than the 8.4-day and the 7.6-day mean serial interval reported for SARS and MERS, respectively. 5,20 More importantly, the serial interval is shorter than the estimates of the mean incubation period (4.9 days), suggesting that a proportion of secondary transmission may occur before symptom onset of the first-generation cases. Li et al. 17 estimated the mean serial interval at 7.5 days based on the cases reported in Wuhan city early in the epidemic (mostly in December 2019). However, there were only six pairs first-generation and secondary cases in this study, and the small sampling bias may have been introduced to the variance and mean. Our observed serial interval has been consistently demonstrated by a recent study that the estimated mean serial interval was 4.2 days based on 20 pairs of first-generation and secondary cases. 21 .

Therefore, we believe more effective measures should be taken to stem the transmission of asymptomatic contact during the incubation period. Once a case is confirmed, it is imperative to trace back all the close contacts within at least three days prior to the symptom onset, and then quarantine these close contacts. If a patient has extensive social activities before the symptom onset, the risk of transmission will be greatly increased. Therefore, restricting social activities and restricting travel in and out of the cities in severe epidemic areas may effectively reduce the transmission. All the information about the cases in this study comes from the data released by local authorities, and the cases were screened for analysis by using the same criteria. The information of the cases released by local authorities outside of Hubei province, including the exposure history, was relatively complete and reliable, because less cases were reported outside of Hubei province and staffs working at local center of disease control (CDC) staffs had enough time to interview the cases as soon as possible. Therefore, this study provides a reliable incubation period and a strong evidence of the COVID-19 transmission during the incubation period. Nevertheless, there are some limitations in this study. The data about virus detection were not available for those asymptomatic persons in their incubation period. Since the follow-up quantitative reverse-transcriptase-polymerase-chain-reaction (qRT-PCR) of virus nucleic acid assay was not available for most close contacts currently in China, it is difficult to obtain evidence of molecular biological monitoring in a short time. If qRT-PCR assays are performed for a group of close contacts, more convincing evidence will be provided for transmission of COVID-19 during the .

The pandemic, which has rapidly spread to over 210 countries, continues to inflict severe public health and socio-economic burden in mamy parts of the world, including in Nigeria. It has, as of May 18, 2020, accounted for over 4.7 million confirmed cases and about 315,000 deaths globally. In the absence of a safe and effective vaccine or antiviral for use against the pandemic in humans, control efforts are focused on the use of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs), such as social (physical)-distancing, community lockdown, contact tracing, quarantine of suspected cases, isolation of confirmed cases and the use of face masks in public. Nigeria is one of the countries in Africa that is hardest hit with the burden of the COVID-19 pandemic. We developed a mathematical model for assessing the COVID-19 pandemic in Nigeria, and use the model to assess the community-wide impact of the various control and mitigation strategies implemented nationwide, as well in two states of the Nigerian federation (Kano and Lagos) and the Federal Capital Territory (FCT Abuja), to effectively curtail the pandemic. The model was parametrized using COVID-19 data published by the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC). The Kermack-McKendrick compartmental epidemic model we developed in this study, which takes the form of a deterministic system of nonlinear differential equations, has a continuum of disease-free equilibria, which is rigorously shown to be locally-asymptotically stable whenever a certain epidemiological threshold, known as the control reproduction number (denoted by R c ), is less than unity. The epidemiological implication of this result is that the COVID-19 pandemic can be effectively controlled in Nigeria, whenever R c < 1, if the initial sub-populations of the infected compartments of the model are small enough. In other words, COVID-19 can be effectively controlled in Nigeria if the control and mitigation strategies implemented are able to bring (and maintain) the threshold quantity (R c ) to a value less than unity.

67547,"We found the quantitative and qualitative correlation between the revealed and unrevealed cases in peak dates and sizes contingent on presently available surveillance data. The dates of saturation for the unidentified did not occur simultaneously with the formally identified, implying the fundamental existence of the gap. It predated by nearly two-and-half months. In contrast, the peak size of both was at a comparative level. Both estimates hinged on the duration of infection. Prior to the saturation of the unidentified, the gap in size increased over time; in contrast, the opposite was to be observed when the summit was reached. A lengthier duration postponed the peak dates and enlarged the peak size accordingly, causing the outbreak more difficult and thus costly to settle down. The changes in the rate of medical quarantine and non-medical containment could quell the trend of unidentified cases and thus the spread. In a setting where the capacity of healthcare was presumed with relative stability, non-medical containment such as staying home or at local places, physical distancing and tracing close contact was to implement with priority. Our simulations implied that it could potentially incur a comparative level of effect when effectively followed. We projected that under an interval [8d,18d] for duration of infection, the peak size of COVID-19 outbreak in Japan would be of a range 24 to 38 thousand of unidentified infections, the peak dates of which would potentially fluctuate between late April and mid of May. Although a commensurate level of peak size could be expected for the confirmed cases, the time of saturation presented a delaying effect and converged until late May to late July hinging on the strength of the infectiousness. The declaration of state of emergency changed the initial exponential growth to the extent where peak date of outbreak would occur at a point around July. For the unidentified, this saturation might come at an earlier time, probably within the window of the emergency or by the end of May. The trajectory of epidemic reflected the interactions of external containment strategies and the transmission factors coupled with changed behaviors in response to the outbreak. The heterogeneity in confirmed and unconfirmed cases, rate of quarantine and containment did influence the trajectory of outbreak. And this heterogeneity prospectively played its role during the first couple of months. One percentage increase in the rate of non-medical antedated the peak date by nearly 18 days and a size reduction of almost one-thirds. If the rate of medical quarantine increased by 10-folds, the peak date would arrive roughly 17 days earlier with an almost 33 percent cutting in peak size. We projected that confirmed cases were to saturate in late July or that time around and unidentified cases were to peak prior to that time, almost two-and-half months earlier. More stringent containment was of necessity in order to acquire greater diminishing effect on the outbreak. The forecasts could potentially be impacted by other omitted factors such as capacity (e.g., pathogen testing capacity) and quality of healthcare, changing biological effects, social (e.g., the degree of shared sense of crisis in population) and spatial heterogeneities. 23, 24 Spatial variations such as structure of population mixing were found to exist, as the prefectures close to Tokyo were most populated in Japan. And for these communities, more stringent quarantine adherence was needed to a more flattened curve of outbreak. 25 In the case resistance to drastic disease-control measures was at work, rising infection rates and mortality, coupled with scientific uncertainty about COVID-19, the curve of infections would fluctuate with larger uncertainty. We estimated the scenarios where medical quarantine and non-medical containment impacted the trends of COVID-19 pandemic. Preventing further transmission by decreasing the potential channels of infections and effective reproduction number. However, the feasibility of these strategies was to be   ()   . . 12.20096792  compromised if the number of infected reached a threshold of the total population. One critical factor was how asymptomatic, pre-symptomatic and mild-symptomatic individuals responded to COVID-19 in regard to the feasibility of prevention of a second-time outbreak. Other factors that might impact the trajectory of the COVID-19 pandemic were not accounted for in our model as well. In the case where presumed assumptions were relaxed, the likelihood in connection with differentiated scenarios would increase. The simulation based on the fitted parameters indicated that the unidentified cases were generally larger than the reported cases. We investigated a range of scenarios where the heterogeneity of containment changed the trajectory of the transmission. As uncertainty existed in the factors such as the interval of infectiousness for asymptomatic, non-medical containment would be of importance to enhance the effect of control in combination with medical quarantine. The model could be modified to incorporate other unaccounted factors impacting the dynamics of the transmission, which would implicitly alter the trend of the COVID-19 outbreak. To avoid and control spread in randomness, the first couple of months might be of great importance. 7, 8 As clinical knowledge of this novel pathogen and its dynamics accrues, it is feasible that outcomes will improve. It therefore will be of concern to revise these estimates as epidemics unfold. 26 And because of the asymptotic approach utilized, qualitative evidence was to be established. The inherent relationship between the confirmed and unknown cases was asymptotically identified and hence its precision was up to the point where the inherent approach applied. The analysis could not differentiate the efficacy of specific containment, nor could it differentiate the effect for the asymptomatic, presymptomatic, symptomatic and infection-route-unknown compartment respectively. However, it reinforced other findings by showing that medical and non-medical control, when timely and successfully implemented, were feasible in decelerating or even diminishing the spread of the pandemic: with an earlier arrival of peak dates and reduced peak sizes. This could be informative when it was too lengthy for the outbreak to converge and when it was to accurately interpret the outbreak as ""plus "" resulting from the dynamics. The meaning of this study partially lied in that we asymptotically identified the quantitative size of this. Containment measures were preferred to be performed at an earlier stage and the effectiveness has been identified in other countries and past outbreaks. Changes of behaviors were observed in response to the epidemic where asymptomatic, mild-and pre-symptomatic infections were not to be ascertained. The might be of great importance for developing control measures for presently widely spread secondary or future recurrent outbreaks of COVID-19. While Japan may not be one of the countries with the highest infections or highest mortality rate of COVID-19 per capita worldwide to date, it has been listed as one of the chains transmissions resulting in extensive spread. 2 Multiple important lessons emerged in that integration of healthcare services across sectors amplified the resilience to respond to shock; misinformation remained to be unresolved and the mutual trust of patients, professionals, and society as a whole in response to the health crisis. 27 As the capacity of healthcare became overwhelmed, the coordination between local healthcare providers and local government was to be another challenge. To avoid recurrent outbreaks of SARS-CoV-2 after the initial pandemic wave, it was critical that the capacities of healthcare were not to exceed its saturation absent other interventions. Discussions thus far hovered over the comparatively low number of Covid-19 tests in Japan, less than 2 per 1,000 individuals compared with 12 in South Korea and 18 in the US up to the point. ""Personnel-related bottlenecks"" was supposed to hinder the broader use of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to   ()   . . 12.20096792  screen for the virus. In contrast, the effectiveness of pathogen testing has been confirmed in other countries. 28 The dynamics of COVID-19 caused the intrinsic existence of individuals with undetected SARS-CoV-2 infection. It is of priority to act according to WHO's recommendations of a combination of measures: rapid and adequate diagnosis, immediate isolation of confirmed cases, rigorous tracking and precautionary self-isolation of close contact. Medical quarantine and non-medical control have been implemented by other countries to prevent further spread and helped reduce the imported or exported cases. 18 While it is critical to balance the control of spread and economic impact from COVID-19, when this is not feasible then priority is to be taken. 29, 30 The transmission of COVID-19 was supposed to be more infectious than past SARS outbreak. 31 Infectiousness was estimated to peak on or before symptom onset, and thus many infections potentially took place in an unnoticeable way. Disease control measures should be adjusted to account for probable substantial subclinical transmission. 32 COVID-19 had more severe pre-symptomatic and asymptomatic infections than influenza A and SARS and clinical studies were to evaluate the viremia and the dynamics in individuals. Heterogeneities might exist in the between-communities measures as well as in the responses to containment, growth in sporadic events could overwhelm the contact tracing system, leading to the necessity for broader-scale social interventions. Ongoing data collection, epidemiological analysis and alongside clinical research on COVID-19 are therefore essential parts of assessing the impacts of measures. 29 Prolonged or intermittent non-medical measure such as social distancing may be of necessity years ahead. 31 This might potentially redefine the daily routine that we are experiencing by this time. 23 It was shown that the crude size of epidemic could be roughly estimated based on its initial dynamics under certain public health interventions. The possible trajectories of an outbreak hinged on the levels of public health interventions such as quarantine and precautionary measures. 33 The uncertainty of the timing and duration of peak was contributable to multiple factors, including stochasticity in early dynamics, heterogeneities in contact patterns, spatial variation and dynamics of the epidemiological parameters. 29 SARS was eventually contained by means of prompt isolation, strict quarantine of contacts, and top-down enforcement of community containment and COVID-19 outbreak of the first wave has been controlled in some countries to date. Striking similarities between SARS and COVID-19 were identified, but more difference was to be ascertained. Even if traditional public health measures are incapable to completely contain the outbreak of COVID-19, they will still be operative in reducing the peak incidence and mortality when no vaccine is available. 34 While rigorous control policies were to associate with a slower growth in cases, in the extremity where stay-at-home restrictions are unlikely to be the one-shot deal, a gradual approach to restrictive measures might be of necessity. 23 It will be particularly meaningful to design measures for long-term medical and non-medical control of COVID-19, along with large scale testing and contact tracing and isolation. Research should concentrate on refining specific estimates of susceptibility to infections, which is instrumental to appraise the impact of these strategies. 28 In the absence of effective measures, pandemic spread widely and thus considerable effort at a variety of levels was of necessity for the outbreak to settle down. Such efforts will be essential to quench local outbreaks and reduce the risk of further global dissemination. 35, 36 Protective measures would compromise the effectiveness as cases accrue or the later dynamics altered significantly, in which optimization of the   ()   . .12.20096792  treatment and the development of specific medicine would be of priority when the costs of herd immunity were misestimated. 37, 38 In conclusion, the dynamics of COVID-19 incurred the intrinsic gap in the peak sizes and the peak dates between confirmed and unconfirmed cases. Interventions based on medical quarantine and non-medical containment present a strong potential to reduce the magnitude of peak sizes and cause an earlier arrival of peak dates of COVID-19 outbreak in Japan. Lowering and flattening of the pandemic peak is particularly of concern, as this reduces the acute pressure on the healthcare system as well as on the society. When it is of difficulty to pinpoint the next epidemic, the measures taken as of today would matter. 16, 39 Contributors NI, ZWQ, WS, and GY conceived the study.

67602,"The COVID-19 is spreading world-wide but stopped spreading in China. Since the spread of the disease is highly related to population migration, it follows a Lévy flight behavior which is characteristic of human mobility [21] . The long incubating period together with the Lévy flight long jumps makes the disease very hard to control and raise the alarm for the other countries. By the time that infected individual is being detectable, one can already perform a long-distance trip and further spread the disease. In fact, the strong relation of population migration and the disease spreading indicates that early quarantine of Hubei province could prevent the worldwide spreading. This is the reason why quarantines are so critical not only for infected persons, but also for others that were nearby infected individuals. The lifetime of the disease in a city is characterized by two stages, uncontrolled infection in early times and decaying stage at later times once quarantines are being performed. These two stages can explain the disease situation in China and predict the situation in other locations in the world if similar strategies will be adopted. Our results suggest that early action may attenuate the disease propagation and prevent overload of the health system which may not be ready for the large amount of unexpected new patients. The stage of the disease in China is almost stable although it was the country with most of infection cases up to the middle of March 2020. The reasoning is that most of the infected cities in China applied strict quarantine measures, leading to exponential decay of disease. However, in other locations around the world, most of the cities are still at the early stages at which the disease is less controlled and may lead to another or even worse outbreak at high risks.

67663,"We find that temperature negatively relates to COVID-19 transmission. However, the effect of relative humidity relies on temperature. High humidity promotes COVID-19 transmission when temperature is low but reduces COVID-19 transmission when temperature is high. Currently, the temperature of most countries in the northern hemisphere is rising, which will gradually decrease the transmission of COVID-19. Specifically, regions such as Singapore and Philippines with high temperature and high humidity throughout the year have inherent advantages of containing the disease spread. In regions such as Japan, the temperature and humidity increase simultaneously. This greatly favors COVID-19 containment. In regions such as United States, England, and Spain, the relative humidity is expected to decrease when the weather becomes warmer. Although suppressing COVID-19 transmission in the regions is becoming more optimistic, the effect of changing meteorological conditions would be lower compared with the other regions in the northern hemisphere. By contrast, the meteorological factors of countries in the southern hemisphere are becoming more unfavorable to contain the epidemic. For instance, in Australia and South .

67715,"Background Limited data are available on the T cell responses for the asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection case. Methods The first imported SARS-CoV-2 infection case in Wuhan was admitted in hospital for quarantine and observation. The T cell responses were followed up by flow cytometry analysis of the peripheral blood nonnuclear cells (PBMCs) at days 7, 13, 22, and 28 after admission. Findings We found the first imported SARS-CoV-2 infection in Wuhan is an asymptomatic case. His T cell differentiation, proliferation and activation matched the classical kinetics of T cell responses induced by viral infection, but the activation maintained at a relatively low level. Function analysis indicated frequencies of IFN-{gamma} producing CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were notably lower than that of the healthy controls (HC) at day 7, and then rebound gradually. But IFN-{gamma}+CD8+ T cells were detained at a significant lower level even at day 28, when the SARS-CoV-2 virus had already become undetectable for 3 weeks. Moreover, percentage of IL-17 producing CD4+ T cells was also detained constantly at a much lower level compared to HC. At day 7, although percentage of Tregs was in normal range, the frequency of activated Treg (aTreg) was remarkably as high as 4.4-fold of that in HC. Interpretation The T cell activation in the asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection experienced a significant suppression and presented impairment of Th1/Th17 and CD8+ T cell functions. Early elevation of the aTregs might play role in the activation and function of T cells in the asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection.","Background Limited data are available on the T cell responses for the asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection case.<q>Methods The first imported SARS-CoV-2 infection case in Wuhan was admitted in hospital for quarantine and observation.<q>But IFN-{gamma}+CD8+ T cells were detained at a significant lower level even at day 28, when the SARS-CoV-2 virus had already become undetectable for 3 weeks.

67736,"It is well-recognised that measuring mortality is surprisingly complex, but the challenges therein should not deter us from examining the shape of the UK Covid-19 mortality data. It should be examined on its own and in the context of the two mitigating interventions, which will have left their impressions on that shape. There is a lot of information encoded within the mortality data. This work set out to recover that information. This author initially set out expecting to find, and hoping to confirm that, stochastic processes and chaotic dynamics would be sufficient to challenge the concept of a second-wave. The author then believed that the initial rapid exponential phase of unmeasured infection would have had to have been so great to create a 3-day doubling in deaths 20 days later, that the remnant susceptible population would be insufficient to maintain a second epidemic. This work did not set out to fit curves to support a hypothesis for the existence of a secondwave, but rather it set out to disprove their possible existence for the UK Covid-19 epidemic. Having now modelled many epidemics the author has been surprised at the findings and impressed with the impact of the lockdown. The lockdown is crippling the economy and has other deleterious impacts on health. It is tempting to lift it now deaths are falling but this work supports prevailing arguments that a staged and gentle relaxion of the restrictions should take place. The simulations presented here demonstrate that maintaining social distancing during a relaxation of restrictions would be the most effective mechanism for limiting spread and containing a second-wave. However, this conclusion is almost inevitable since social distance through the inverse square relationship is central to this model's mechanism of transmission. The absolute number and nature of the movements reported in this work should not be overinterpreted as having any implication about the actual number and nature of real-life social interactions and how they might be modified. This model simulates more or fewer interactions and closer or more separated interactions and nothing more than these. The number of movements, their magnitude and their variance were introduced into the model purely as a device to permit experimentation to establish adjustable parameters capable of finding . CC-BY-NC 4.0    ()  .   epidemics with the infected population growing in a similar way to that suggested by Covid-19 data and which permitted second-wave phenomena for study. Some consider that asymptomatic transmission might not be a major driver of transmission (2) . Asymptomatic infection has been considered to be relatively rare but many cases who are asymptomatic on the date of identification have gone on to develop disease and so the proportion of truly asymptomatic infections remains unclear. There is some asymptomatic transmission in this model which could be increased. Individuals who remained susceptible after the first peak in infections had slightly higher susceptibility factors making them slightly less susceptible (data not shown). The second peak represented slightly less vulnerable individuals in these simulations. In the real-world something similar may also apply. In this model neither the number of movements nor the distances moved were stratified according to age or sex. It is tempting to incorporate them to simulate, for example, a greater number of interactions between children. Such refinements might model the impact of allowing children to return to school as part of a staged relaxation of social restrictions. However, it is likely that the noise generated by the stochastic mechanisms would make such nuances difficult to detect. There is always a risk in over-elaboration or over parameterizing an otherwise simple and robust model.

67809,"The role of environmental transmission of SARS-CoV-2 remains unclear. Particularly the close contact of persons living together or cohabitating in domestic quarantine could result in high risk for exposure to the virus within the households. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the whereabouts of the virus and whether useful precautions to prevent the dissemination can be given. 21 households under quarantine conditions were randomly selected for this study. All persons living in each household were recorded in terms of age, sex and time of household quarantine. Throat swabs for analysis were obtained from all adult individuals and most of the children. Air, wastewater samples and surface swabs (commodities) were obtained and analysed by RT-PCR. Positive swabs were cultivated to analyse for viral infectivity. 26 of all 43 tested adults (60.47 %) tested positive by RT-PCR. All 15 air samples were PCR-negative. 10 of 66 wastewater samples were positive for SARS-CoV-2 (15.15 %) as well as 4 of 119 object samples (3.36 %). No statistically significant correlation between PCR-positive environmental samples and the extent of infection spread inside the household could be observed. No infectious virus could be isolated under cell culture conditions. As we cannot rule out transmission through surfaces, hygienic behavioural measures are important in the households of SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals to avoid potential transmission through surfaces. The role of the domestic environment, in particular the wastewater load in washbasins and showers, in the transmission of SARS CoV-2 should be further clarified.","The role of environmental transmission of SARS-CoV-2 remains unclear.<q>Particularly the close contact of persons living together or cohabitating in domestic quarantine could result in high risk for exposure to the virus within the households.<q>Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the whereabouts of the virus and whether useful precautions to prevent the dissemination can be given.

67914,"In this paper, based on the COVID-19 data of seven provinces/cities in China during the spring of 2020, we make a systematical investigation on the forecast ability of eight widely used empirical functions, four statistical inference methods and five dynamical models reported in the literature. We highlight the significance of a well balance between model complexity and accuracy, over-fitting and under-fitting, as well as model robustness and 13   ()  sensitivity. We further introduce the Akaike information criterion, root mean square errors and robustness index to quantify these three golden means and to evaluate various epidemic models/methods. Through extensive simulations and detailed comparisons, we find that the inflection point plays a crucial role for making reliable forecasts, in agreement with previous reports 16 . The RMSE of model prediction decays exponentially with respect to the size of training data set, while the model robustness characterized through the variance of final epidemic size also approaches to unity rapidly after the inflection point. Furthermore, the forecast abilities of several epidemic models are also closely related to the inflection point. For example, the estimated basic reproduction number R 0 by the exponential growth method exhibits a transition from overestimation to underestimation with the increasing in the size of training data set, and the inflection point acts as the demarcation. We notice the Logistic functions always underestimate the total number of infected cases, 14   ()   . . 12.20034595  while the Gomertz's function makes an overestimate in all cases we studies. Hill's and Richards' functions do not have such a consistency. Since the sequential Bayesian and time-dependent reproduction number methods take the non-constant nature of the effective reproduction number with the progression of epidemics into consideration, we think they are more accurate than the exponential growth and maximum likelihood methods especially in the late stage of an epidemic. The transition of exponential growth method from underestimation to overestimation with respect to the inflection point could be quite useful for constructing a more reliable forecast. Towards the dynamic models based on ODEs, it is observed that the SEIR-QD and SEIR-PO models generally show a better performance than the other three, highlighting the essential of a trade-off between model complexity and fitting accuracy. The success of the former two models could also be attributed to the inclusion of self-protection and quarantine during the progression of COVID-19 epidemics. This work has some limitations. The analyses are highly relied on the quality of the epidemic data. The initial conditions and parameter regions may also affect the results significantly, though our qualitative conclusions will not be changed. Besides five simple ODE models, many other epidemic models inclduing PDEs, stochastic equations and timedelayed equations are not considered. In addition, further validations than seven cases are needed to explore the applicable regions of all the methods/models.

67970,"Today, health systems around the world are prioritizing the use of tests for people who have either had direct contact with an infected person or are symptomatic. Some countries, such as South Korea, use extensive resources to test people randomly. On the other hand, there is a clear understanding that contact tracing technology, either by localization, or by contact monitoring using short range wireless communication, is a critical tool in dealing with rapidly evolving epidemics. Our results show that the proper use of contact tracing must be complemented with a proper probabilistic analysis of the contact data (number of contacts, duration, etc.) to guide new tests of infection. The larger the testing capability, the more elaborate the algorithms must be to exploit the additional testing capacity. We demonstrated that testing people using the methodology of a controlled experimental design in the spatio-temporal dimensions based on belief approximation exploits the available testing capacity much more efficiently. This results in a significant reduction of the burden on the healthcare system, the morbidity, and the negative economic and societal impact. The cost of expanding the number of tests is negligible compared to the tremendous positive advantages, and we encourage governments to invest resources in this effort. As shown for an advanced stage epidemic with 0.1% of the population already infected, the quarantine of large portions of the population (e.g., > 2%) can be reduced by over two months compared to random testing and by almost two weeks compared to simple neighbor testing, when up to 0.3% of the population is being tested every day. Similarly, the peak load on the health system can be reduced by 18% compared to testing randomly and by 10% compared to contact tracing with no controlled testing. Since the total morbidity is also lower, on one hand and also correlated with the death rate, many lives can be saved as well. Similarly, it was shown that for early stage spread, using controlled testing can prevent the huge deterioration of the situation before it gets out of hand. While controlled testing ideas can be applied under standard epidemiological investigations, without technological contact tracing, the delay involved and the inability of scaling to the millions, it clearly supports the use of technological contact tracing. Another interesting observation is that random testing benefits significantly from very large numbers of tests, but that even testing up to 5% of the population daily still yields inferior results on both the deterministic and controlled testing policies. This underscores the importance of contact tracing and accurate probabilistic modeling. Finally, some comments are in order regarding other factors. We used a false negative rate of 10 − 20%, but results scale favorably even with a 30% false negative rate. Similarly, our study assumed a 85% quarantine success rate. It was only mildly degraded when the quarantine rate went down to 70%. This shows that the method is robust to real world problems.

For ease of modelling, we have assumed homogenous distribution of the Indian population that does not capture variations in population density or the urban-rural variations. It is also being assumed that all the peoples have equal susceptibility to COVID-19. The mathematical model 1 has been modelled to implement natural evolution of the COVID-19 disease in the Indian population was without screening, quarantine and NPI. It has been reported in literature that multiplying factor for COVID-19 is approximately 2.6. Hence, the spread scenario has been shown in figure ?? and ? ? for different number of days. The growth of COVID-19 cases is exponential in the case of without screening, quarantine and NPI. India is in the early stage of the COVID-19 pandemic, with a lower growth rate than other countries studied. In the present manuscript, three mathematical model have been 17 .

It has been found that the numbers of COVID-19 patients will be more without screening the peoples coming from other countries. Since, every people suffering with COVID-19 disease are spreaders. The screening and quarantine have been implemented in mathematical model 2. It has been found that number of spreaders is less than that of model 1. However, expected performance is not achieved due to leakage i.e. peoples not following quarantine. Mathematical model 3 has been designed with screening, quarantine with NPIs. It has achieved reasonable performance in reducing number of spreaders. Hence, it is found that immediate implementation of Non-Pharmacological Interventions among the general population, including complete lockdowns, has the potential to retard the progress of the pandemic. It has been also observed that COVID-19 spread will be completely recovered till 13 − Jun − 2020 approximately in India.

68270,"Our analysis suggests that quarantine greatly reduced the number of cases and deaths seen in Hubei's COVID-19 outbreak. In addition, while quarantine does not appear in the representation of R 0 , it still indirectly reduces R 0 . We also saw that the dynamics of the outbreak is very sensitive to the quarantine rate s q and contact rate β, as indicated by our sensitivity analysis. The basic reproductive number is estimated as 5.49 and the study shows that any change in β or i q directly affects the basic reproductive number. The quarantine decidedly reduces the number of cases and deaths. Increasing (or decreasing) the speed of movement from the susceptible class to the quarantine class by about 10% would double (or half) the number of cases and deaths due to the outbreak (This speed of movement is controlled by the rate s q ). Of course, the efficiency of the quarantine is also very important. In our model, the efficiency of the quarantine measured by the reduction rate, r. The reduction rate shows how much reduction is effected in the contact of COVID-19 thanks to the quarantine. Based on our sensitivity analysis, this parameter is very important (see Figure 6 ). Our model shows that the quarantine in Hubei was almost perfect since it caused about 98.9 percent reduction in the contact rate of COVID-19. Another important parameter that plays a crucial role in the dynamics of the outbreak is the rate of reported (infected) cases i q which is directly related to the number of tests given to detect infected individuals. Similar to the quarantine rate s q , the rate of reported (infected) cases i q could double (half) when we have 10% reduction (or increase) in the rate. As of 30 March 2020, there were no reported cases in Hubei in the past week and the total number of cases and total number of deaths were 67801 and 3187, respectively. Based on our 15-days forecasting, the number of cases in Hubei was projected to be about 67994 and the number of deaths was projected to be about 3254. Thus, we estimate the fatality rate of the outbreak to be about 4.8% in Hubei. Our model gives about 6% relative error and we are confident that using the model will be helpful for forecasting local outbreaks of the pandemic in other regions. From existing COVID-19 data from Turkey and the dynamics of our model understood from the Hubei analysis, the outbreak in Turkey is expected to reach its peak between April 20 and April 26 depending on the number of individuals (amount of people) in quarantine and the number of COVID-19 tests carried out each day in Turkey. The daily number of tests given in Turkey is large when we compare to the rates of reported cases in Hubei. As we showed in the sensitivity analysis, increasing the number of COVID-19 tests and the number of individuals in quarantine will significantly reduce the number of cases (and deaths). Based on our forecasting, the number of cases will be about 203,700 with the range 148,100 and 281,500, and the number of deaths will be about 8,269 with the range 6,005 and 11,430 depending on quarantine rate, s q and the rate of reported cases, i q in Turkey. Thus, in any cases that are given in Figure 9 and 10, the fatality rate of COVID-19 will be about 4.1% in Turkey. .

68292,"Our study was focused on modelling the COVID-19 epidemic in Balochistan in order to estimate the number of infections, the peak infection day, the rate of increase of infections per day and the resolution of the end-point of the epidemic 1. The simulation parameters were adjusted according to the population of Balochistan. Our model simulated the conditions where COVID-19 is spreading in a closed population of 12344408 people, without the effect of any extraneous variables such as social distancing, hand washing or travel restrictions. The values of R =2.65, β =0.378 and γ =0.14 were used. According to the simulations the peak infection day will occur on 5 th July 2020, where 30,00000 persons could get infected with the virus . Previous reports from China 8 have indicated that COVID-19 initially follows an exponential growth pattern 9 coupled with asymptomatic carriers 10 , leads to a rapid increase in the number of infections. The study starts from the 10 th May 2020 using the situation report and prior to 200 days the peak is predicted to have reached with 30,00000 individuals infected that is almost 25% of the population will be infected till 5 th of July 2020. However, the major concern for Balochistan would be the healthcare system which would not be able to cope with the overwhelming number of patients if the trajectory remains the same. Studies place the mortality rate of COVID-19 at 2.3%, severe cases at 14% and critical cases at 5% 12, 13 , which would imply that potentially 60,000 could die; 420,000 cases could become severe and 150,000 could become critical during the aftermath of epidemic in Balochistan. Therefore, there is an urgent need to implement effective measures to curb the rise in COVID-19 infections in Balochistan, otherwise it could lead to drastic consequences.

68342,"The difference in our predicted infection prior to and after Feb 5 quarantine in the Diamond Princess Cruise Ship outbreak reveal the possible transmission routes involved in. For those infected in staterooms without an infected individual (i.e. non-close contact category), the predicted infection all occurred prior to Feb 5. The peak effective reproduction number on the ship was approximately 11 as predicted by Mizumoto and Chowell (2020) , much higher than the mean estimates elsewhere of 1.7-7 (Mizumoto and Chowell, 2020) . However, they also the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is .   predicted a peak infection 1-2 days after Feb 5, which differs slightly from our predicted peak on Feb 3. The infection among passengers was significantly reduced following the quarantine starting on Feb 5, but according to our prediction, the passenger infection was already on the way to decline from 3 Feb as they became aware of the outbreak and exercised selfdiscipline. For those infected in the staterooms with infected individual (i.e. close contact category), the infection occurred both prior to and after Feb 5 quarantine. The lack of crossroom transmission between passengers of different staterooms during the quarantine period strongly suggests that the ship central air conditioning system did not play a role, i.e. the long-range airborne route was almost totally absent in the outbreak, based on our predicted data. The Diamond Princess Cruise Ship was built and completed in 2004 by Mitsubishi Industries. A centralized full-air air conditioning system with VAV was designed and installed in all passenger staterooms and crew cabins, with 30% fresh outdoor air for staterooms, 50% for public areas and 100% for clinics and kitchen etc. A fully independent exhaust air system was installed from the bathrooms. Although no measured ventilation rate was reported for the ship, international standard such as ISO 7547:2004 requires 8 Litre/s per person, which is similar to those in offices and other public spaces (ASHRAE62.1, 2007). It was also reported that the maximum outdoor air supply was operated during the quarantine period. This probably implied that a reasonably ventilated indoor environment such as that on this ship would not result in cross transmission of the virus due to the long-range airborne route. On the other hand, the predicted higher infection of non-close contact passengers prior to the quarantine and the higher infection for crew after the quarantine strongly suggested that the close contact and/or fomite transmission played a role. Figure 1b shows that the non-close contact transmission of beyond-room passengers all occurred prior to Feb 5. The number of the infected in the close contact category, i.e. within-cabin transmission is only 17, the predicted infection dates might not be sufficiently accurate, and the data presented in Figure  1B is only indicative. The peak infection date of the within-cabin or close contact infected is clearly behind that of the non-close or beyond-cabin contacted. The infection settings prior to the quarantine on Feb 5 might be similar to those norovirus outbreak reported in the cruise ships. Diamond Princess actually had an outbreak of gastroenteritis caused by norovirus in Feb 2016, in which 158 passengers and crew were sick on board (ABC News, 2016) . It is known that the norovirus infections on cruise ships affected the largest number of people (Harris et al., 2010) , often at hundreds. Crowdedness has been cited as an explanation for this cruise ship norovirus infection phenomenon (Harris et al., 2010, and Bert et al., 2014) . Surfaces on cruise ship public restrooms are known to have high potential for fecal contamination (Carling et al., 2009) . The same effect of crowdedness and fomite for the norovirus might have also happened to SARS-CoV-2 in this ship. The crowdedness and close contacts due to on-board leisure and social activities outside the staterooms could explain the observed higher infection among non-close contact passengers prior to the quarantine. According to the National Institute of Infectious Diseases (NIID), Japan website (NIDD, 2020), for the 536 Covid-19 cases among 2646 passengers, a higher cabin occupancy corresponds to a slightly higher attack rate, possibly due to the relatively smaller number of the within-cabin close contact transmission. Based on our retried data from a drawing, only 6 out of 75 passengers from 1-person cabins became confirmed cases (attack rate 8%), while for 2-person cabins, 485 of 2386 passengers were infected (20%), for 3-person cabins, 27 out of 125 (22%) and for 4-person cabins, 18 out of 60 (30%).   the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is . . org/10.1101 org/10. /2020 The spatial distribution of the infected cabins can also reveal if the central air conditioning played role. Among the 1353 staterooms available on board, the cabin area ranges from 15-16 m 2 for 1137 ""interior"", ""oceanview"" and ""balcony"" rooms, 26 m 2 for 186 ""mini suite"" rooms, 31 m 2 for 29 suites or family suites, and one grand room of 58 m 2 . We do not have the data of distribution of the confirmed cases among these rooms. Sekizuka et al (2020) stated that ""all COVID-19 patients were widely distributed in all 18 decks across the ship"". The spatial distribution of the confirmed cases in another cruise ship outbreak involving a small number of the infected passengers might also serve as a reference (International Financial News and Beijing News, 2020) . The World Dream ship departed from Port of Nanshan, Guangzhou on 19 Jan 2020, visited Nha Trang and Da Nang in Vietnam on 19-24 Jan with 6903 passengers and crew on board, and among them, 108 were from Hubei in which 28 from Wuhan. The ship returned to the port of Nansha on 24 Jan. The distribution of the nine infected staterooms and the distribution of the 183 Hubei passengers on the ship were both random. Central airconditioning system is commonly designed in spatial zones, and each air handling unit serve one zone. We failed to identify any spatial infection clusters in the World Dream cruise ship outbreak. Our study thus offers some support for the current recommendation by most health authorities that the COVID-19 virus is mainly transmitted by close contact and fomite (WHO, China NHC, US CDC, 2020). We reveal that most infection in the ship occurred during a period when passengers and crew members were still in regular or often close contacts before the quarantine began. The onboard transmission must have been rather limited prior to Jan 28. This explained why none of the more than 130 passengers and 27 crew members who disembarked in Hong Kong on Jan 25 developed the illness, and also no on-land infection was reported on Chang Mae and Cai Lan in Vietnam, and also at Keelung. 77 (59.7%) of the 129 infections among the passengers occurred during the ship's journey between Okinawa and Yokohama, i.e. on Feb 2-4. It is noted that significant infection only started to grow on board from Jan 28 ( Figure  1a) . The on-board number of the symptomatic cases on Jan 31 was not significant. This probably explains the lack of infection of any local residents at the port of Keelung. Interestingly, two taxi drivers were confirmed in Okinawa respectively on Feb 14 and Feb 19 (MHLW, 2020b) and both had the ship passengers as their customers on Feb 1. The possible infection date of Feb 1 of the two taxi drivers also agrees with the significant number of infected individuals on the ship, though majority were pre-symptomatic or asymptomatic then. We do not have access to the passenger/crew boarding and disembarking data at the other 4 ports except Hong Kong for further analysis. If there was a lesson to be learned, the ship could immediately disembark all passengers and quarantine them on land on Feb 1 when the former 80 years old passenger confirmed his infection, which might be considered as too idealistic. Our prediction shows that the implemented quarantine at 7 am Feb 5 worked well for the passengers, but not for the crew probably due to the need of passenger service by the crew (refs) . There is a need for improved prevention measures for crew in similar situations. Our estimation method is not without limitations. We cannot rule out the possibility of other infections during later part of the quarantine period due to incomplete data. Among the 634 cases confirmed by Feb 20, though 328 were asymptomatic, 306 were symptomatic at the time of confirmation. However, only 197 of the 306 symptomatic individuals had onset date, and further data from the remaining 109 symptomatic individuals may change our prediction.   the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

We used the estimated incubation period from 186 patients in China, with known dates of both infection and onset of symptoms. The governing equation is known to be ill-posed, and assumptions were made (see Methods section, and also Li et al, 2005) , though our method successfully predicted all seven reported super spreading events in the 2003 SARS epidemics in Hong Kong and Singapore. Figure S1 also showed that we also successfully predicted in the infection date for the 186 patients. Lastly, our approach cannot be used to study the roles of the asymptomatic cases in the transmission. The asymptomatic cases were first detected on the ship when the tests were extended to all passengers on Feb 15 after focusing in those with symptoms (Wikipedia, 2020) . If the spatial distribution (room where the confirmed case stayed) of both symptomatic and asymptomatic cases is available, it may be possible to infer if any asymptomatic transmission occurred and how.

68373,"The wide territorial, demographic, infrastructural diversity of mainland countries as Brazil demands an epidemic modeling of the COVID-19 with geographical resolution higher than usual compartmental epidemic models, which can be achieved using the metapopulation framework. Performing simulations of COVID-19 epidemics at municipality level for Brazil with diverse mitigation scenarios (none, moderate, and strong) and considering the integration of different regions through long distance mobility of persons, we have identified a high degree of heterogeneity and desynchronization of the epidemic curves in the main metropolitan areas and countryside regions. The diversity of outcomes is observed in several geographical scales from states to immediate regions, that encloses groups of nearby municipalities with strong economic and social ties. The stronger mitigation attitudes the more remarkable are the differences. We found moderate or strong correlation between the delay of the epidemic peak in countryside regions when compared with the capital cities of the respective state for most of states with well connected immediate regions. However, one exception was PR state where diverse epidemic foci evolving apparently independently of the capital city. The administrative organization of Brazil gives to the federative state and municipalities some independence to adopt mitigation approaches but are limited by the economic dependence on superior spheres. So, the tendency is to have similar approaches within states. Our simulations indicate that uniform mitigation measures may not be the optimal strategy. In a municipality where the peak naturally happens after the capital of its state, it will delay even more if strong mitigation measures are adopted synchronously with the capital. On the one hand, such a municipality probably would have to extend the mitigation for much longer periods since once the epicenters of epidemics start to relax their restrictions the viruses would circulate faster, reaching these vulnerable municipalities with essentially the entire population still susceptible. The social and economic impacts could be higher. On the other hand, an eventual collapse of the local heath system in countryside regions could also occur after the larger metropolitan areas were under control paving the possibility of unburdening the local healthy care system. Actually, the desynchronization of the epidemic curves and consequently of the sanitary systems' collapse can be used as an important ally in the prospection of optimal resource distributions. One important attitude is to preserve these reservoirs in countryside as long as possible. It could be done in at least two forms. The first one is reducing to a lowest possible level the flux of people from areas with high incidence of COVID-19, in other words, strict sanitary cordons in the epidemic epicenters. This approach is theoretically obvious but can hardly be achieved in practice and only Wuhan had success in this endeavor [5] . The second option is to flatten the curves as much as possible in the . CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0    ()  .   main metropolitan regions. Beyond the positive consequences for their own sanitary systems, this attitude would have the positive side effect of delaying epidemics in the countryside. Our study points that countryside regions are not safe in medium-term but have a precious additional time to be prepared. Not less important, a constant monitoring of possible local transmission by massive testing policies [36] even without significant epidemic incidence still is the only safe path to keep countryside economically active while others epidemic epicenters are locked down.

68398,"This rapid systematic review aimed to provide a comprehensive summary of the evidence on pandemic control, with a focus on cost-effective interventions in the context of COVID-19. Randomized trial evidence was only available to support the effectiveness of hand washing and face masks. Modelling studies suggested that these measures are highly cost-effective. For other interventions, only evidence from observational and modelling studies was available. This lowerquality evidence suggests that overall, when timed appropriately, the following interventions are likely to be highly cost-effective: contact tracing and case isolation, protective equipment for healthcare workers, and vaccination prior to the outbreak (when available). Surveillance networks and protective equipment for healthcare workers are also likely to be cost-effective. Home quarantine for confirmed cases and stockpiling antivirals appear less cost-effective. The least costeffective interventions appear to be social distancing measures like workplace and school closures. The evidence suggests that these are more cost-effective for severe viruses like SARS-CoV-2, and when timed early in the outbreak. Vaccination past the peak of infections and long-term school closures late in the outbreak appear less cost-effective, underscoring the importance of timing. (March 17). They point out that the high rates in Italy may be due to differences in population age, definition of COVID-19-related deaths, and testing strategies. Based on the above, our assessment of the cost-effectiveness of interventions is based on an estimate of 1 to 2% case fatality rate for   ()   . . 1101 COVID-19. The cost-effectiveness of interventions also depends on their timing. Taking this into account, we propose a 3-stage framework for pandemic control interventions, adapted from Madhav et al. (2017) . This framework is illustrated in Figure 1 . Stages are shown from left to right, and interventions are shown from top (most cost-effective) to bottom (least cost-effective). Figure 1 shows the cost-effectiveness of interventions to control COVID-19 by stage of the pandemic. According to this framework, surveillance networks are highly cost-effective, should be established before the pandemic starts (stage 1), and maintained through stages 2 and 3. Vaccination, when available, should occur before the pandemic, or as early as possible. Antivirals can be stockpiled cost-effectively in high-income countries. As the pandemic starts (stage 2), early contact tracing and case isolation is the most cost-effective intervention. It may be sufficient to contain the outbreak. If the outbreak is not contained, hand hygiene, face masks, and protective equipment for healthcare workers are all highly cost-effective. If these measures are not sufficient, home quarantines, social distancing, and school closures are all effective, albeit increasingly costly measures. Assuming a 1 to 2% case fatality rate for COVID-19, these measures are likely to be cost-effective nonetheless, especially if implemented early. As COVID-19 spreads (stage 3), and especially past the peak, the costliest interventions can be replaced cost-effectively by a   ()  . . .1101 combination of interventions centered on swift contact tracing and case isolation. Once antivirals are available, they can also replace the costlier interventions cost-effectively. Hand washing and face masks were the only measures supported by higher-quality evidence. Other interventions were supported by lower-quality evidence. In the context of COVID-19, a cautious interpretation suggests that (1) social distancing is effective but costly, especially when adopted late and (2) adopting as early as possible a combination of interventions that includes hand washing, face masks, swift contact tracing and case isolation, and protective equipment for healthcare workers is likely to be the most cost-effective strategy.

Integrating these estimates and high-resolution real-time human travel and infection data with mathematical models, we estimated that the number of infected individuals during early epidemic double every 2.4 days, and the R0 value is likely to be between 4.7 and 6.6.

68469,"Our model indicates that foreigners exhibit a larger infected population, hospitalization rate, and infection rate when compared to the interstate population. Moreover, as foreign individuals make contact with interstate individuals, the rate of infection within the interstate population increases significantly. To the best of our knowledge, our study is the first to create a disjoint mutually exclusive compartmental model. Our model suggests that both foreign and interstate travel lead to increased risk of infection within the United States population. Consequently, we validate the effectiveness of quarantine as a public health intervention model by the US government and encourage implementation of efforts to mitigate interstate travel. There are multiple reasons that foreigners have increased risk of obtaining Covid-19 when compared to interstate population. First, as people travel, they risk exposing themselves to a greater number of other individuals. The WHO indicates that transmission of Covid-19 occurs primarily through droplet transmission(2019). Most methods of international travel, including airways, railways, and waterways, crowd individuals in compact and enclosed spaces. Being in close contact with individuals with respiratory symptoms in an enclosed environment increases the risk of being exposed to infected mucosae (Tatem et al. 2006) . Second, the guidelines and strategies for addressing the epidemic differ among countries. For example, while India has enforced total lockdown, the US government have not mandated enforced lockdown (Chatterjee et al. 2020) . Consequently, when individuals from countries with different regulations arrive, they may be infected and increase the incidence of covid-19. Finally, the vaccination standards differ among countries. In particular, BCG vaccine, believed to confer protective effects against Covid-19 is recommended in some countries, but not the US(Aaron Miller, Mac Josh Reandelar, Kimberly Fasciglione, Violeta Roumenova, Yan Li and Otazu 2013). As a result, future research and modelling is necessary to determine the protective effects of the BCG vaccine, and its potential to reduce the incidence of Covid-19 within the United States. Given that 2019-nCoV is no longer contained within Wuhan, we recommend the United States government close their borders to both foreign and interstate travel. We CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0    ()  .   recommend significant public health interventions at both international and interstate levels otherwise large cities with close inter-transport systems could become outbreak epicenters. Finally, we recommend preparedness plans and mitigation interventions be readied for quick deployment on both a state and federal level. Based on our model, compliance with these recommendations will effectively reduce the transmission of Covid-19 as a result of foreign and interstate travel.

68574,"As in other countries that adopted isolation measures, the spread of COVID-19 in BR had a slow start. Despite that, after about two months since the first confirmed case, on May 20, 2020 BR reaches second place among the countries that present more confirmed cases of the disease, only behind the United States of America [3] . The results shown in this work point to the necessity to quantify the effectiveness of social distancing interventions for the control of the disease in BR, specifically in its most affected localities. Besides, it is essential to take rapid responses to the emergence of new cases and their impact on the public health system. The Brazilian continental 5 . CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0    ()  .   dimension and great social and demographic differences are factors that hinder the elaboration of public policies for the disease control. The present paper aims to contribute to the development of a model framework to investigate the expansion of COVID-19 in Brazilian locations and the impacts of different measures of social distancing. We apply the developed approach to model the COVID-19 dynamics in BR and RJ. This high populated Brazilian state was one of the first states to adopt mitigation actions, such as the suspension of classes, cancellation of events, and home isolation [13] . According to the current data released by the Brazilian Ministry of Health, RJ is one of the most affected states, both in the number of registered cases of COVID-19 and in the number of deaths. For this reason, the present study analyzes the spread in this state, as well as in the country as a whole, in order to assess the particular characteristics of the pandemic at those different spatial scales. Extensive research for the spread of COVID-19 in BR with multiple perspectives has been reported, e.g., [7, 13, 8] . The present work takes into account factors that are predominant in the Brazilian reality, such as the current limited testing capacity and the policy to test only severely ill hospitalized individuals. We hope that the present investigation brings some insights or guidelines for public health and policy-makers. Due to data paucity, parameter identifiability is a major difficulty. To overcome this issue, only four model parameters were calibrated using a Bayesian approach. Other parameters, as well as model ICs, were set based on available information on COVID-19 (SI -Table A. 3). Our simulation forecasts that the peak of active cases occurs on May 24, 2020 (95% CI: 21-26) and May 28, 2020 (95% CI: 24-2) for BR and RJ, respectively. This difference can be explained due to the discrepancy of the spatial scale, and the way the disease has spread along the different Brazilian locations, considering, for instance, the different political measures taken and the social and demographic structure of each state. The social measures implemented in RJ at the beginning of the pandemic seemed to be able to flatten the epidemic curve and postpone the peak of active cases [13] . Aiming to evaluate the influence of uncertainties in hard-to-track populations such as undiagnosed infected individuals (I and A), as well those who carry the disease and are unable to transmit (E), we performed a sensitivity analysis to understand which model factors (parameters and ICs) play important roles at the various stages of the epidemic for both BR and RJ. The analysis confirms that a proper understanding of how the disease spreads can provide insights and aids to elaborate containment decisions in order to reduce R(t). In this sense, considering both BR and RJ, sensitivity analysis suggests that the most influential parameter for a long term perspective is the quarantine removal rate parameter (ω). We have shown that the rate at which S, E, I and A individuals are removed due to quarantine measures significantly affects R(t), C and D. Such average values under the actual social distancing policy are an idealization since actual values are dynamic and spatially heterogeneous, as mentioned in the last paragraph. In order to study the qualitative effects of changes in social distancing policies, we propose to model ω as an exponential decay function, which can represent different social distancing relaxation scenarios. When more abrupt social distancing relaxation is implemented after the occurrence of the peak of active cases, it accompanies a longer extension of the duration of the disease, with approximately 19% increase in the projected numbers of C and D. If implemented before the peak, the consequences can be devastating, as indicated by our results. The hypothetical scenario built by considering a slow and gradual release implemented 20 days before the original peak indicates a delay of 14 days in the occurrence of the peak of active cases, with more than 890 thousand C and about 85 thousand D accumulated over less than nine months of the presence of the disease in BR. Our simulations highlight the importance of relaxing social distancing measures only under a very careful follow-up. We note that the analysis performed in this paper should be viewed from a qualitative perspective. The conclusions for the considered hypothetical scenarios (with and without distancing relaxation) are based on model predictions and current employed policies. Model simplifications and the calibration procedure of model parameters can explain potential quantitative discrepancies between our predictions and data. Such simplifications include: (i) homogenization of age, social, and spatial structure, (ii) some model parameters are fixed, with values obtained from the literature, and (iii) model parameters are constant along time (except ω, that in some simulations varied in time). Moreover, data have limited information due to sub-notification, since only hospitalized cases are tested in BR. These simplifications are inherent of the modeling procedure, and should be viewed as part of the scientific process of the understanding of the natural phenomena. The present paper can be extended in forthcoming studies, for example, by considering models with spatial heterogeneity, parameter dependence in time and space, and also analysing data considering sub-notification. Data considering other BR states could also be analyzed employing the same procedure adopted in the present paper. Another possible extension could be related to the determination of limit thresholds in the number of P cases under different relaxation social distancing measures. It is important to highlight the impacts of social distancing relaxation in order to control the epidemic. Adoption of this type of measure directly affects the evolution of R(t), as shown in our results. For both BR and RJ, it implies a much slower stagnation or decrease in R(t) from the time the measures are implemented. Since R(t) is in a controlled situation for both scenarios, i.e. R(t) < 1, a direct consequence is that the disease would need more time to be eradicated. Our analyses suggest that policies based on short-term social distancing are not enough to control 7 .

68583,"The Diamond Princess (DP) cruise ship was put under quarantine offshore Yokohama, Japan, after a passenger who disembarked in Hong Kong was confirmed as a COVID-19 case. We performed whole genome sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 directly from PCR-positive clinical specimens and conducted a haplotype network analysis of the outbreak. All tested isolates exhibited a transversion at G11083T, suggesting that SARS-CoV-2 dissemination on the DP originated from a single introduction event before the quarantine started. Although further spreading might have been prevented by quarantine, some progeny clusters were linked to transmission through mass-gathering events in the recreational areas and direct transmission among passengers who shared cabins during the quarantine. This study demonstrates the usefulness of haplotype network analysis in identifying potential infection routes.","The Diamond Princess (DP) cruise ship was put under quarantine offshore Yokohama, Japan, after a passenger who disembarked in Hong Kong was confirmed as a COVID-19 case.<q>We performed whole genome sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 directly from PCR-positive clinical specimens and conducted a haplotype network analysis of the outbreak.<q>Although further spreading might have been prevented by quarantine, some progeny clusters were linked to transmission through mass-gathering events in the recreational areas and direct transmission among passengers who shared cabins during the quarantine.

68608,"Motivation: Wuhan pneumonia is an acute infectious disease caused by the 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19). It is being treated as a Class A infectious disease though it was classified as Class B according to the Infectious Disease Prevention Act of China. Accurate estimation of the incubation period of the coronavirus is essential to the prevention and control. However, it remains unclear about its exact incubation period though it is believed that symptoms of COVID-19 can appear in as few as 2 days or as long as 14 or even more after exposure. The accurate incubation period calculation requires original chain-of-infection data that may not be fully available in the Wuhan regions. In this study, we aim to accurately calculate the incubation period of COVID-19 by taking advantage of the chain-of-infection data, which is well-documented and epidemiologically informative, outside the Wuhan regions. Methods: We acquired and collected officially reported COVID-19 data from 10 regions in China except for Hubei province. To achieve the accurate calculation of the incubation period, we only involved the officially confirmed cases with a clear history of exposure and time of onset. We excluded those without relevant epidemiological descriptions, working or living in Wuhan for a long time, or hard to determine the possible exposure time. We proposed a Monte Caro simulation approach to estimate the incubation of COVID-19 as well as employed nonparametric ways. We also employed manifold learning and related statistical analysis to decipher the incubation relationships between different age/gender groups. Result: The incubation period of COVID-19 did not follow general incubation distributions such as lognormal, Weibull, and Gamma distributions. We estimated that the mean and median of its incubation were 5.84 and 5.0 days via bootstrap and proposed Monte Carlo simulations. We found that the incubation periods of the groups with age>=40 years and age<40 years demonstrated a statistically significant difference. The former group had a longer incubation period and a larger variance than the latter. It further suggested that different quarantine time should be applied to the groups for their different incubation periods. Our machine learning analysis also showed that the two groups were linearly separable. incubation of COVID-19 along with previous statistical analysis. Our results further indicated that the incubation difference between males and females did not demonstrate a statistical significance.","Motivation: Wuhan pneumonia is an acute infectious disease caused by the 2019 novel coronavirus (COVID-19).<q>Accurate estimation of the incubation period of the coronavirus is essential to the prevention and control.<q>It is being treated as a Class A infectious disease though it was classified as Class B according to the Infectious Disease Prevention Act of China.

68664,"In this work we propose a mathematical approach to investigate the eects on the COVID19 epidemic of social behavioral changes in response to lockdowns. Starting from a SEIRlike model, we assumed that the transmission and quarantine rates are partially determined on voluntary basis and depend on the circulating information and rumors about the disease, modeled by a suitable timedependent information index. We focused on the case of COVID19 epidemic in Italy and explicitly incorporated the progressively stricter restrictions enacted by Italian government, by considering two step reductions in contact rate (the partial and full lockdowns). The main results are the followings: • we estimated two fundamental informationrelated parameters: the information coverage regarding 16 . CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0    Tables 1, 2, 3. the daily number of quarantined and hospitalized individuals (i.e. the parameter k) and the information delay (the quantity a −1 ). The estimate is performed by tting the model's solution with ocial data. We found k = 0.8, which means that the public was aware of 80% of real data and a −1 = 3 days, the time lag necessary to information to reach the public; • social behavioral changes in response to lockdowns played a decisive role in curbing the epidemic curve: the combined action of voluntary compliance with social distance and quarantine resulted in preventing a duplication of deaths and about 46% more contagions (i.e. approximately 360,000 more infections and 35,000 more deaths compared with the total unresponsive case, as of May 18, 2020); • even under circumstances of low information coverage and high information delay (k = 0.2, a = 1/60 days −1 ), there would have been a benecial impact of social behavioral response on disease containment: as of May 18, cumulative incidence would be reduced of 6% and deaths of 11% about. Shaping the complex interaction between circulating information, human behavior and epidemic disease is challenging. In this manuscript we give a contribution in this direction. We provide an application of the information index to a specic eldcase, the COVID19 epidemic in Italy, where the information dependent model is parametrized and the solutions compared with ocial data. Our study presents limitations that leave the possibility of future developments. In particular: (i) the model captures the epidemics at a country level but it does not account for regional or local dierences and for internal human mobility (the latter having been crucial in Italy at early stage of COVID19 epidemic); (ii) the model does not explicitly account of ICU admissions. The limited number of ICU beds constituted a main issue during the COVID19 pandemics [22] . This study did not focus on this aspect 17 .

68774,"In this paper we have considered the effects of non-exponential distributions of incubation and recovery periods which are suggested by available data, as well as age structure, on dynamics of COVID-19 and its possible containment using quarantine. Numerical simulations of the mean-field model that does not include age-specific differences in disease parameters and contacts has shown that for the same mean incubation and recovery periods, increasing the number of stages of incubation period makes the epidemic reach its peak and die down faster, while increasing the number of stages in the recovery period leads to a significant increase in the maximum total numbers of infected and critical care cases. Age structure has a major effects on how effective the quarantine is in ""flattening the curve"", i.e. in reducing the number of hospitalised and critical care cases. In terms of optimal quarantine timing, if it is 11 . CC-BY-ND 4.0    ()  .   introduced for only 8 weeks, introducing it sooner will have a smaller effect on reducing the second peak of infection. In fact, it may even be possible that the second peak will be smaller than the first, but we only observed this for quarantines that were introduced later in the epidemic. In terms of critical care cases, there is also a notable variation between different regions in terms of whether the second peak is smaller than the first, and by how much it is reduced compared to the case with no quarantine, depending on when a fixed-duration quarantine is introduced. Effectively, this suggests that if the quarantine is introduced for some fixed duration, the timing of its introduction should be adjusted for each particular region to achieve maximum effect, or it should be kept for a sufficiently long time. We have also investigated the potential impact of quarantine duration when it is introduced simultaneously in different regions 8 weeks after the start of an epidemic. The results suggest that changing the quarantine duration from 8 to 12 or 16 weeks does shift the timing of the second peak, but has very little effect on the magnitude of this second peak in terms of either the total number of infected, the number of critical care cases, or deaths. The biggest percentage reduction in these numbers was observed for Brighton and Hove, the region with the youngest population among the three we considered. The model presented in this paper can be made more realistic by including some additional features of disease dynamics, and further details of its progression. This includes relaxing the assumption about equality of latency (time from infection to becoming infectious) and incubation (time from infection to displaying symptoms) periods and considering them as two independent parameters; inclusion of additional compartments, such as deaths outside hospitals; analysis of some specific settings in which disease is transmitted, such as care homes, with their particular age-specific contacts. Similarly to other SIR-and SEIR-type models, our model has an underlying assumption that disease confers a life-long immunity. At this point, the data on potential secondary COVID-19 infections are rather limited, but should it become established that immunity from COVID-19 is temporary, this can be easily incorporated into a model by including direct transitions from the recovered classes back to susceptibles. Model parameters can also be further refined once more detailed age-stratified data on cases, deaths, and progression of patients in hospitals become available, though we expect the main qualitative conclusions of our analysis to hold.

69202,"Modeling and analyzing the spread of COVID-19, and assessing the effect of various policies could be instrumental to national and international agencies for health response planning (9, 14, 21, 28, 36, 38) . We show that the effect of interstate travel reduction is at most modest in the United States when the outbreak has already widespread in all states. On the other hand, we need to impose strong transmission-reduction intervention and increased testing capacity and report rate to contain the spread of virus. The result is in agreement with previous findings (9, 12, 14, 23, 36, 40) , suggesting that the effect of travel ban at a later stage of the outbreak is rather modest. This is also in line with the fact that the outbreaks still occurred in Europe even upon the strong travel ban on the earlier epicenter of Wuhan and its surrounding cities in China. We also show that the transmission-reduction intervention such as policies on the social-distancing and shelter-in-place rules, and the increase of testing rate, which facilitates immediate isolation upon exposure, will significantly reduce the total infected population. Such effect is mostly visible for the states of NY, NJ, MI, and IL. Particularly, our modeling results showed that for states such as NY and MI, to achieve an optimal infection reduction, a more proactive approach needs to be taken to quickly identify the exposed population and isolate them within two days of exposure in order to ensure the infection reduction. The result is in agreement with previous findings (24, 28) . We do need to emphasize that the model itself does not distinguish different ways of traveling across states. Indeed, if the interstate travel is conducted mostly through transiting through busy airports and train stations, and the social-distancing policy is not strictly imposed, then the high population density at these places will bring up the transmission rate b locally in space and time, leading to a higher infection rate. This is a severe consequence, but it should not be counted as the direct result of relaxing travel restrictions.

69413,"Knowledge and attitude surveys can be used as an asset to identify gaps in knowledge, certain misbeliefs and patterns of behavior. Such gathered information can be helpful to plan for better action especially in the current time where public appears vulnerable to media littered with piles of misinformation that lacks accuracy at times [16] . This misinformation can create a response that varies from full-fledged terror and panic to complete negligence, which can impede a successful response to the current pandemic in both ways [15, 19] . The response to COVID-19 requires cooperation of the public through following government-issued strict quarantine and social distancing measures, which are the best strategies to lessen the effects of the pandemic and to prevent collapse of health care system [14] . This also applies to university students where the conditions that accompanied the pandemic have resulted in psychological and educational difficulties [30] . The swift spread of COVID-19 pandemic was met initially by alertness of the public in some countries, confusion and panic in others. Panic could particularly be related to lack of accurate information about the pandemic [4, 31, 32] . One of the main misconceptions is the presence of conspiracy theories regarding the origin of the virus itself [15, 33] . The interplay between virus evolution and dynamics of virus emergence, diversification and spread has been reviewed by Pybus and Rambaut [34] . Virus evolution by itself is not the sole factor for the increased incidence of infectious disease. [36] [37] [38] [39] . Thus, conspiracy theories regarding origins of viral diseases, including COVID-19 are not plausible on any scientific level. Currently, there is sufficient conclusive evidence that explains the origin of SARS-CoV-2 from bat reservoir [40, 41] . Other currently circulating misconceptions include the presence of effective treatment of COVID-19 using antibiotics (azithromycin) and antimalarial (hydroxychloroquine) that have not been proven as effective treatment yet, with variable and conflicting results [42] .

The results of this study highlight the negative effect of misinformation that is conveyed by media teeming with fallacies and assumptions that lack substantial evidence, particularly the belief in conspiracy role in the pandemic. The negative impact on UJ students was revealed by significantly higher level of anxiety and lower knowledge about COVID-19 in those who believed in these claims of conspiracy. This must be addressed by the main sources of knowledge that were identified by the participants (e.g. MoH, TV, social media outlets), which are encouraged to have robust fact-checking processes, before conveying information about this unprecedented pandemic.

69477,"In this study we have estimated the severity of the COVID 19 outbreak in Pakistan, modelling the transmission dynamics of the disease using an extension of the SEIR model. The model includes important transmission pathways such as asymptomatics, quarantined and isolated individuals as well as the medicated population sub group. We also use this model to project the epidemic curve and give estimates of the disease burden under various realistic control strategies. An ordinary differential equation based model is used for the transmission dynamic of COVID 19 as described above. Disease free equilibrium (DFE) and an en equilibrium when the disease is endemic in the population is derived. We establish a threshold quantity R0 in terms of the parameters of the model, observing that the disease dies out whenever R0 < 1 and is endemic if R0 > 1. We study the variation of R0 on some of the model parameters, specifically on the parameters which can be varied by various control mechanisms, such as quarantine, social distancing and medication. We note that quarantine and social distancing and medication can help in lowering the value of R0 and bring the epidemic under control, with quarantine being the most effective mechanism followed by social distancing and medication. However there are practical difficulties in establishing a strict quarantine as is evident from the relaxation of lock downs in most countries, hence a mix of all these strategies is perhaps the best way forward. Noting that in Pakistan the epidemic progressed in two distinct phases, before and after the lock down restrictions were relaxed, we estimate the value of R0 separately for both these phases. For the pre relaxation phase we estimate R0 = 1.07 and for the post relaxation phase our estimate comes out to be R0 = 1.86. This is consistent with the growth dynamics and other estimates in the literature. These results are then used to project the epidemic curve. We explore various possible scenarios, with varying levels of lock down, social distancing and medication. The lock down and social distancing measures are captured by quarantine rate ( ) and contact rate (β) in our study. In the case where a strict lock down is enforced taking the quarantine rate back to pre-relaxation level, varying the contact and medication rates, we observe that in the best case scenario with high level of all controls the epidemic will peak around late June to early July with a maximum active infected number around 90000. For a moderate lock down which is modelled by taking the quarantine rate to be twice the post-relaxation rate, and varying the contact and medication rates we note that the epidemic will peak around mid July with the active infected numbers around 120000 at that point considering that social distancing measures are enhanced. Finally, we look at the case when no further lock down measures are taken and the quarantine rate remains at the value estimated on June 15, in this scenario we note that the epidemic will peak around late September with the maximum active infected number around 700000. In this work we estimated the severity of the COVID 19 outbreak in Pakistan, noting that the epidemic followed two different trajectories before and after lock down restrictions were relaxed. The restrictions we observe kept the value of R0 close to 1, however once the restrictions were eased the number of cases increased at a high rate, reflected in R0 = 1.86. We also generated possible future trajectories based on intervention and control measures to varying degrees. In case no significant measures are taken at the peak of the epidemic, which will occur in September the maximum active cases will cross the 700000 mark while in a very optimistic scenario this will happen in early July with maximum active cases contained to around 150000. We strongly agree with the recent WHO recommendation that some form of moderate lock down needs to be reinforced, this along with social distancing and possible medication will result in a disease peak sometime in mid July and contain the maximum active infected numbers to around 120000. Inaction at this point of the epidemic is projected to have very serious consequences both in terms of disease burden and mortality. 14 .

69670,"TriSilix is a low-cost, high-precision, integrated nucleic acid amplification and detection technology that is ideally suited for point-of-need diagnosis of infectious pathogens (bacteria, viruses etc.) 14 affecting, humans, animals and plants. TriSilix can perform both isothermal and cyclic nucleic acid amplification; integrates temperature control and DNA detection on the same device, is label-free, requires minimal sample handling and allow operation by minimally trained personnel. Although TriSilix is a silicon-based technology, it does not need a cleanroom for fabrication; chips can be produced in a standard wet-lab with easily accessible laboratory equipment worldwide. Because fabrication in an advanced silicon foundry is not needed, reliance on the global supply chains is substantially reduced; silicon foundries are located only in a few countries in the world. Each TriSilix chip costs ~0.35 USD (cost of materials is shown in Table S9 ) when produced at wafer-scale with 4-inch wafers but the cost could be reduced further by moving to 8-inch wafers, decreasing the size of each chip and optimizing the fabrication process (for example, the gold contacts at the bottom of the TriSilix chip could be replaced by another appropriate metal to form Ohmic contacts). Due to its small size, integrated form-factor, and low-power requirements, TriSilix can be controlled with a portable, battery-operated handheld analyzer. Using a Li-ion battery with a 4000 mAh capacity (a typical rating for batteries in modern smartphones), TriSilix is estimated to perform at least 40 tests using isothermal amplification reactions at 40 °C lasting 30 min or 13 tests using 35 cycles of PCR (these estimates assume that the electronics for the handheld analyzer also draw 50 mA while operating). The TriSilix technology has the following three disadvantages: (i) currently TriSilix uses MB as the redox-active reporter to quantify the products of the NA amplification reactions in real-time. MB is known to polymerize and its activity also slightly decreases over time at elevated temperatures. This issue, however, can be addressed by the use of redox-active metal-complexes that also intercalate with DNA, several of which have already been reported in the literature for real-time NA For most NA amplification processes, however, 110 °C is sufficiently high. In case higher temperatures are needed (for example for on-chip sample prep), the fabrication process would need to be modified and thermoplastics with a higher melting point could be used. In the future, we will design a handheld analyzer and include all electronics needed for the operation of TriSilix in the same device to simplify and enable its use in the field (currently the potentiostat for electrochemical NA sensing and driver electronics for heating + temperature sensing are separate). We will also add capabilities to communicate with smartphones to have access to the cloud so that the result of each diagnostic test can be passed to health agencies remotely. 37, 38 To enable on-site testing, we will implement on-chip lysis capabilities (such as mechanical 39 or heatinduced cell lysis 40 ) to analyze the samples taken directly from the subject without further sample prep. We will also implement on-chip reverse transcription to enable analysis of RNA. TriSilix would be particularly useful in emergency situations, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, where rapid, early, on-site detection of the virus would accelerate intervention and reduce the spread of the pathogen. Since TriSilix is a low-cost, high-performance NA detection technology, it is expected to find applications beyond infectious diseases which may include genetic analysis of various plants, animals or detection of genetic diseases. TriSilix is a versatile platform and could also be adapted for electrochemical detection of non-genetic targets (e.g., through the use of antibodies) with on-chip incubation capabilities to deliver accelerated results at the Point-of-Need. Prior to the DNA measurements by SWV, the sample reservoir was cleaned with DNA decontamination reagent (Fisher Scientific) followed by Nuclease-free ultrapure water (Fisher Scientific).

69671,"The entire world is facing a new pathogen, so far unknown for humans. Nevertheless, some experts had been lately suggesting that a similar scenario could happen (Allen et al. 2017 ). Although the model has limitations, since it is a simplification of the reality, the results of the calibrated model ( Figure 3 ) fits quite well with the official data of infected people with COVID-10 in Spain until 24 March. Until today, it is difficult to obtain the most probable R0 after 14 March because of the time lag of detected patients due to the incubation period (set at 6 days). Therefore, further time is needed to quantify the effect of mitigation measures in the R0 reduction. We think that the real amount of infected people would reach, at least, 2.1 times the official numbers, calculated from a 3.4% fatality rate from days 24 and 25 March ( Figure  4 ). If the fatality rate estimation changed, the real numbers of infected people would rise up consequently. It is important to remark that not knowing the real numbers of infected people does not significantly affect the power of the approach we propose here, since the comparison of different scenarios (e.g. reducing R0 after a day or another) uses the same base model. Hence, we can say that the measure that works better in the model, would work better in the real world as well. Besides, the results of this model would improve if we could adjust all the parameters to the real situation. Then, we could build a more robust model. In fact, our intention is to generate further versions of this model with whenever more accurate parameters are available. Fatality numbers followed a smooth curve until 24 March, when the increase of deaths was higher than expected, but on 25 March it went down again. In case the amount of fatalities does not follow the way pointed out by the dotted lines in Figure 5A , we will recalculate the fatality rates showed in Figure 5A and 5B, but we will wait a few more days. Moreover, more time is still needed to check a possible third scenario, that is a higher case fatality rate as the epidemic saturates health services. Regarding the social distancing measures, the model detects and quantifies the positive effect of reducing the R0, as seen in Figure 6 . According to our results, the earlier the measures are taken, the better, as seen in Figure 7 . We also tested what would happen if a random testing policy for all population would have been adopted. Even performing 20 or 30 million tests (from a population of 47 million) the result is poor (Figure 8) , indicating that the efforts of testing should be more focused on suspected cases. This last approach was adopted in China by a contact tracing strategy (WHO 2020c) that allowed isolation of those infected prior to symptoms, and also a door-to-door monitoring to identify cases with symptoms (Shen et al. 2020 ). In the last of the scenarios, we analyzed what would happen if the isolation measures ceased 10 days after their implementation. As seen in Figure 9 , these measures should not cease, since there are still infective individuals in the population and no herd immunization is operating due to the low percentage of population recovered and thus, immunized by illness. With the parameters used in the model, the peak of infected cases will occur around 8-9 th April ( Figure 10 ). These numbers could be more accurate by using more reliable data of the COVID-19 evolution of the real infected population. Nonetheless, we think the error of the model could be of few days. Other models state that the peak would occur around 14 th April in Spain (Burgos-Simón et al. 2020). It is interesting to point out that it would be vital to prevent infection number from increasing, maintaining the lowest R0 possible after the peak. As seen in Figure 10 , an R0 higher than 0.15 would rise the number of new cases of infection again. Other models of the spreading of COVID-19 in Spain, e.g. Burgos-Simón et al (2020), did not compare scenarios of different actions to reduce the speed of spreading and stated that the peak would occur between 18 and 20 April, about 10 days after our calculations ( Figure 10 ). Arenas et al (2000) predicted ICU saturation from the end of March to the 23 April, although we did not represent the ICU patients, the peak of new infected people (Figure 10) is expected for the 8-9 April, so ICU higher demand will be concentrated from some weeks after that date, probably a couple of weeks after Arenas' model. Another model applied in Spain with data from 28 February with few dozens of cases (Aleta and Moreno, 2020) expressed the necessity of early detection of positive cases with symptoms. But from our point of view, due to the incubation period when the patient is contagious and the great percentage of asymptomatic and subclinical cases, that strategy would have been not enough to stop the spread of this disease, now a pandemic. Ferguson's, reflect the advantages of physical distance among people to reduce the number of infections. This model does not pretend to impersonate official predictions nor scenarios about the COVID-19 spread in the different areas or countries. Considering the complexity of the spreading phenomenon and the exponential component, it is an impossible task for researchers and professionals interested in this pandemic to attempt to predict the dynamics or the effect of different measures without using a model that includes the main aspects of the pandemic. Regarding the forecast for Spain, there are further constraints on the model adjustment i.e. frequent changes in counting rules of infected people and case definition, and changes in testing and isolation policies. In fact, isolation measures were announced to become harder in Spain from Monday, 30 March. Moreover, the evolution of the epidemic differs greatly from one Spanish region to another due to the spatial distribution of the people (rural areas vs. big cities), to population movements, and regional health systems´ characteristics, among others. It must be said that rates can be better calculated in samaller and more homogeneous areas and, in turn, better results can be obtained running the model.. Nevertheless, the model could be customized to fit any region following the instructions aforementioned. One important limitation of our model is the lack of reliable data about the actual cases of infection, mainly asymptomatic and with mild symptoms. In the last days, only the severe cases and suspected cases among active health care staff have been confirmed with a test in Spain. We hope this situation can be changed in the following weeks, as the Spanish Government is acquiring more diagnostic tests (Spanish Government, 2020) . One strength of this model is that is has been conceived open-access. We keen to facilitate others to adapt the model to their own situation. The use of this model for an educational purpose can be a strong tool to convince people about the importance of adopting early social distancing approaches ( Figure 7 ) and also to maintain them in time ( Figure 8 ). We think it could be particularly convenient for researchers and health care staff in lowand middle-income countries. These regions are especially vulnerable to the pandemic. Facing a new pathogen as CoV-2 and its dynamic represents a huge challenge for any country, especially for those with weaker health care systems. Some Sub-Saharan African countries have already detected more than 100 cases of COVID-19 (WHO 2020). Although some knowledge about STELLA modeling is needed, we think that any interested person with a light training could customize it, by adapting the basic data (Stocks and Converters) to the region of interest and generate different scenarios. We are now working in a video tutorial to explain the design of the model in order to facilitate other stakeholders to modify the structure and customize parameters to their areas of interest.

69697,"Since its discovery in the Hubei province of China, the global spread of the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 has resulted in millions of COVID-19 cases and hundreds of thousands of deaths. The spread throughout Asia, Europe, and the Americas has presented one of the greatest infectious disease threats in recent history and has tested the capacity of global health infrastructures. Since no effective vaccine is available, isolation techniques to prevent infection such as home quarantine and social distancing while in public have remained the cornerstone of public health interventions. While government and health officials were charged with implementing stay-at-home strategies, many of which had little guidance as to the consequences of how quickly to begin them. Moreover, as the local epidemic curves have been flattened, the same officials must wrestle with when to ease or cease such restrictions as to not impose economic turmoil. To evaluate the effects of quarantine strategies during the initial epidemic, an agent based modeling framework was created to take into account local spread based on geographic and population data with a corresponding interactive desktop and web-based application. Using the state of Massachusetts in the United States of America, we have illustrated the consequences of implementing quarantines at different time points after the initial seeding of the state with COVID-19 cases. Furthermore, we suggest that this application can be adapted to other states, small countries, or regions within a country to provide decision makers with critical information necessary to best protect human health.","Since its discovery in the Hubei province of China, the global spread of the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 has resulted in millions of COVID-19 cases and hundreds of thousands of deaths.<q>The spread throughout Asia, Europe, and the Americas has presented one of the greatest infectious disease threats in recent history and has tested the capacity of global health infrastructures.<q>Since no effective vaccine is available, isolation techniques to prevent infection such as home quarantine and social distancing while in public have remained the cornerstone of public health interventions.

69718,"Our results on the numerical values of the (effective daily) reproduction number R 0 show that a social distancing of 2 contacts per day is not effective to reduce its value below 1.7, even with a test rapidity t I = 1 day to quarantine infected people. Our study suggests that the two parameters have to be activated at the same time. Requesting strict social distancing without reaching a critical value for R 0 in a reasonable number of days risks a failure and the lose of faith in the adopted mea- sures. The most favorable Scenarios (D) and (E) (cfr. lower panel of Fig. 4 ) need from 10 to 15 days before reaching values of R 0 < 1 despite a screening rapidity of 8 hours (from a starting point of 3 days). The inertia of the distribution can force the time interval up to one month before seeing visible effects. The improvement of rapid diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 with automation and large number of sample processing, is essential in order to implement infection prevention measures lowering R 0 significantly. After March 8th, the measures proposed to reduce the social distancing in Italy have been enhanced each week in order to lower the contact rate (already as low as 2 contact per day, as assumed in the scenarios of Section III. The combined effect of the imposed isolation and a strong reduction of screening time can be seen in the lower curve of Fig. 5 (scenario (D) ). The cumulative effect reduces the delay from 10 days to 5 days to reach R 0 ≈ 1 and in a further 5 days R 0 ≈ 0.15, a value drastically low to see, day by day a 30% reduction of new infected people each day. The corresponding parameters are c ≈ 1 contact per day and t I ≈ 10 hours. These results seem to be fully consistent with the Comment by Anderson et al. [12] . The flexibility of the model we are using can allow the introduction of the effects of such further control restrictions. Eq. (9) shows how such a measures have been further implemented reducing the contact rate from c(t = t 0 ) = c 0 = 2 day −1 to c(t t 0 ) ≈ 0.4. In this case the reproduction number assumes the limiting values R tically lowered and (probably) one can even see such an effect already at the early stage of the epidemic looking at the recent data on upper panel of Fig. 5 (yellow squares) . The same approach can be applied to evaluate the evolution of an epidemic secondary event at the moment of a partial relaxation of the isolation measures adopted. Our findings manifest an unavoidable occurrence of secondary events, however they can find our countries prepared thanks to the delay obtained in the first phase by means of isolation. The strategy to implement is largely based on technological resources opening a new era of fast screening. For a deeper discussion of the results one wonder if the choice of the moment can influence the secondary event in a substantial way. The need of saving the intense care from a large peak of presence pushes the inertia of the event to produce a long time tail it is very hard to keep isolation for a corresponding period. However one can analyze the effects of shift in time. In Fig. 8 the results of this further analysis. The technological improvement of the screening process remains the relevant mitigation ingredient and the structure of the secondary event does not change enough to suggest a further delay.

69787,"The rapid expansion of coronavirus (COVID-19) has been observed in many parts of the world. Many newly reported cases of this new coronavirus during early outbreak phases have been associated with travel history from an epidemic region (identified as imported cases). For those cases without travel history, the risk of wider spreads through community contact is even higher. However, most population models assume a homogeneous infected population without considering that the imported and secondary cases contracted by the imported cases can pose a different risk to community spread. We have developed an “easy-to-use” mathematical framework extending from a meta-population model embedding city-to-city connections to stratify the dynamics of transmission waves caused by imported, secondary, and others from an outbreak source region when control measures are considered. Using the dynamics of the secondary cases, we are able to determine the probability of community spread. Using the top 10 visiting cities from Wuhan in China as an example, we first demonstrated that the arrival time and the dynamics of the outbreaks at these cities can be successfully predicted under the reproductive number R0 = 2.92 and latent period τ = 5.2 days. Next, we showed that although control measures can gain extra 32.5 and 44.0 days in arrival time through a high intensive border control measure and a shorter time to quarantine under a low R0 (1.4), if the R0 is higher (2.92), only 10 extra days can be gained for each of the same measures. This suggests the importance of lowering the incidence at source regions together with infectious disease control measures in susceptible regions. The study allows us to assess the effects of border control and quarantine measures on the emergence and the global spread in a fully connected world using the dynamics of the secondary cases.","The rapid expansion of coronavirus (COVID-19) has been observed in many parts of the world.<q>Many newly reported cases of this new coronavirus during early outbreak phases have been associated with travel history from an epidemic region (identified as imported cases).<q>Using the top 10 visiting cities from Wuhan in China as an example, we first demonstrated that the arrival time and the dynamics of the outbreaks at these cities can be successfully predicted under the reproductive number R0 = 2.

69887,"The novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 has paralysed our societies, leading to self isolation and quarantine for several days. As the 10th most populated country in the world, Mexico is on a major threat by COVID-19 due to the limitations of intensive care capacities, and a total of about 1.5 hospital beds for every 1000 citizens. In this paper, we projected different scenarios to evaluate sharp or gradual quarantine lifting strategies, however, even in the hypothetical scenario that Mexico would continue with full confinement, hospitals would be reaching the maximum capacity of hospital bed occupancy. Mexican government is planning to relax the strict social distancing regulations on 1 June 2020, however, epidemic rebound risks are latent. Our results suggest that lifting social confinement needs to be gradually sparse while maintaining a decentralized region strategy among the Mexican states. To substantially lower the number of infections, predictions highlight that the elderly should remain in social confinement (approximately 11.3% of the population); the confined working class (roughly 27% of the population) must gradually return in at least four parts in consecutive months; and to the last the return of students to schools (about 21.7%). As the epidemic progresses, de-confinement strategies need to be continuously re-adjusting with the new pandemic data. Assuming the most optimistic scenario by our predictions, the smallest number of new COVID-19 cases, Mexico would require at least a 3 fold increase in hospital capacities dedicated for COVID-19. Furthermore, to observe the real dimension of the epidemic, Mexico would need to increase to at least 18 samples per 1000 people, currently is only 0.6 per 1000. All mathematical models, including ours, are only a possibility of many of the future, however, the different scenarios that were developed here highlight that a gradual decentralized region de-confinement with a significant increase in healthcare capacities is paramount to avoid a high death toll in Mexico.","Our results suggest that lifting social confinement needs to be gradually sparse while maintaining a decentralized region strategy among the Mexican states.<q>5 hospital beds for every 1000 citizens.

69910,"Background The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was first reported in China, which caused a respiratory disease known as Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). Since its discovery, the virus has spread to over 100 countries and claimed more than 4000 deaths. This study aimed to assess the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of various response public health measures. Method The stochastic agent-based model was used to simulate the process of COVID-19 outbreak in scenario I (imported one case) and II (imported four cases) with a series of public health measures, involving the personal protection, isolation-and-quarantine, gathering restriction, and community containment. The virtual community was constructed following the susceptible-latent-infectious-recovered framework. The epidemiological and economic parameters derived from the previous literature and field investigation. The main outcomes included avoided infectors, cost-effectiveness ratios (CERs), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs). The sensitivity analyses were undertaken to assess uncertainty. Findings In scenario I and II, the isolation-and-quarantine averted 1696 and 1990 humans infected respectively at the cost of US$12 428 and US$58 555, both with negative value of ICERs. The joint strategy of personal protection and isolation-and-quarantine could avert one more case than single isolation-and-quarantine with additional cost of US$ 166 871 and US$180 140 respectively. The effectiveness of isolation-and-quarantine decreased as lowering quarantine probability and increasing delay-time. Especially in scenario II, when the quarantine probability was less than 25%, the number of infections raised sharply; when the quarantine delay-time reached six days, more than a quarter of individuals would be infected in the community. The strategy including community containment could protect more lives and was cost-effective, when the number of imported cases was no less than 65, or the delay-time of quarantine was more than five days, or the quarantine probability was below 25%, based on current assumptions. Interpretation The isolation-and-quarantine was the most cost-effective intervention. However, personal protection and isolation-and-quarantine was the optimal strategy averting more infectors than single isolation-and-quarantine. Certain restrictions should be considered, such as more initial imported cases, longer quarantine delay-time and lower quarantine probability.","Background The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was first reported in China, which caused a respiratory disease known as Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19).<q>Since its discovery, the virus has spread to over 100 countries and claimed more than 4000 deaths.<q>This study aimed to assess the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of various response public health measures.

69943,"The current novel coronavirus (nCoV) outbreak, COVID-19, was first reported in December 2019 in Wuhan, China has spread all over the world causing startling loss of lives, stalling the global economy and disrupting the social life. One of the challenges to contain the COVID-19 is making people adopt personal hygiene, social distancing and self-quarantine practices which are all related to knowledge, attitude and practice (KAP) of the people in respective countries. Bangladesh, the most densely populated countries with a fast-growing economy and moderate literacy rate, has shown many hiccups in its efforts to implement COVID-19 policies. Understanding KAP may give the policy makers to make informed decisions. Hence, this study aimed to make a quick assessment of KAP of people in relation to COVID-19 in Bangladesh. An online survey using a pre-tested questionnaire conducted in late March 2020 attained 1837 responses across Bangladesh. However, 1589 completed responses were included in statistical analysis to calculate KAP scores, their interrelations with socio-demographic variables. The overall KAP is poor with only 10% of the respondents showed good knowledge with parallel attitudes and practices. Socio-demographic factors have strong bearings on the KAP scores. Significantly higher KAP score is evident in female over male respondents, among aged (45 years and above) over younger respondents and among retired and homemakers above students and public service holders. The study indicated a panic fuelled by poor understanding of COVID-19 associated facts and the need for the government to ensure more granular and targeted awareness campaigns in a transparent and factual manner to gain public confidence and arrest more meaningful public participation in mitigation measures. The study provides a baseline of KAP among people in Bangladesh on COVID-19.","The current novel coronavirus (nCoV) outbreak, COVID-19, was first reported in December 2019 in Wuhan, China has spread all over the world causing startling loss of lives, stalling the global economy and disrupting the social life.<q>Bangladesh, the most densely populated countries with a fast-growing economy and moderate literacy rate, has shown many hiccups in its efforts to implement COVID-19 policies.<q>One of the challenges to contain the COVID-19 is making people adopt personal hygiene, social distancing and self-quarantine practices which are all related to knowledge, attitude and practice (KAP) of the people in respective countries.

69970,"We have presented a generalized SEIQRD mathematical model with a time delay to analyze the spread of COVID-19 infection in a population. The proposed model incorporates spatial and stochastic parameters like heterogeneous population, natural births, deaths, and population migration networks within geographical state boundaries. Based on a detailed analysis of the available public data, we projected COVID-19 pandemic peaks and possible ending time and total infected cases in India. Overall, the current pandemic situation with nationwide lockdown is expected to end up by August, 2020, which is a much better scenario than no lockdown in place. Furthermore, we applied our mathematical model to interpret the public data on the total number of infected cases from March, 16, 2020 onwards in two sub regions of India, including Maharastra and Uttar Pradesh, as discussed in the appendix (D). With lockdown in place, the peak infection witnessed a significant fall in comparison to the situation if there would have been no lockdown indicating the potential benefit of lockdown in controlling the outspread. Our model suggests a bit relaxed lockdown, followed by an extended period of strict social distancing as one of the most effective control measures to manage COVID-19 spread in days to come. Further, capturing the impact of the delay on the pan-demic transmission, we carried the sensitivity analysis on time delay by varying its values systematically. No qualitative changes have been observed in the infection pattern apart from shifting of the curve resulting in possible domain range for estimated infection. Owing to significant spatial variations affecting the basic reproduction number R 0 , we included spatial heterogeneity by dividing the entire population into smaller sub regions. Based on the technique, R 0 and its timedependent generalization has been estimated at both regional and sub regional levels. The approach helped us to capture sensible COVID-19 infection dynamics over local and global levels. The proposed model is an attempt to provide deep insight to analyze the dynamics of COVID-19, helping the involved agencies to arrange and manage crucial resources and design its control strategies. Additionally, the proposed work necessarily made some assumptions when framing the model. We ignore the impact of infection spread due to exposed class [1]. Moreover, the work is based on acquired data for a limited duration of time to fit and estimate the spread of COVID-19. With the release of more epidemic data for India, owing to the regional differences on account of health, education, religion, and per capita income, the key parameters may undergo momentous changes influencing the spread of pandemic among the masses. We consider a large geographic region with total population N , partitioned into n states labeled by j = 1, 2, ...n. The population within the j th state is partitioned into susceptibles (S j ), exposures (E j ), infectives (I j ), quarantines (Q j ), recoveries (R j ) and deaths (D j ), where N j =S j +E j +I j +Q j +R j +D j and N = n j=1 N j . The proposed time delay SEIQRD system that captures population and geographic heterogeneities is given by:   was not certified by peer review)   Here β j > 0 is the average rate of contact between susceptible and infected (people exposed at each time step by infected people) in j th state; λ j,k ∈ [0, 1] denotes the population migration factor for the states j and k. The parameter σ ∈ [0, 1] stands for the portion of exposed individuals, which become infectious per time step and ∈ [0, 1] is the quarantine rate from the infection per time step. We call δ ∈ [0, 1] the proportion of quarantined people who are cured per time step and γ ∈ [0, 1] is the fatality rate due to COVID-19. The parameter τ > 0 is the delay time. Further, without affecting the behavior and general aspects of infection, it is assumed that the population in the j th state is born susceptible with the natural birth rate µ > 0 per one individual per time step and the total population remains constant since the natural death rate is considered to be same as the natural birth rate µ. The first term on the R.H.S. of Eq.(1) represents the fragment of the susceptible individual of j th state who have been exposed to the disease by the infected individuals of the same state and by the infected individuals of the other states, who have moved to the former main state, taking into account the average contact rate; migration coefficients for the states; and the relation between the populations of the states. Those who were exposed to the infection at time t − τ and survive the latent period [t − τ, t] with probability e −µτ moves to the infected class at time t [19, 20] . Moreover, the proportion removed by disease independent mortality for each compartment is given by the last term on R.H.S of each equation. From Eqs.(1) -(6), we get the normality condition S j (t)+E j (t)+I j (t)+Q j (t)+ R j (t) + D j (t) = 1 , for every state j at any time t.

First, laboratory tests by PCR were conducted focusing on symptomatic cases especially at the early phase of the quarantine. If asymptomatic cases where missed as a result of this, it would mean we have underestimated the asymptomatic proportion. Second, it is worth noting that the data of passengers and crews employed in our analysis is not a random sample from the general population. Considering that most of the passengers are 60 years and older, the nature of this age distribution may lead to underestimation if older individuals tend to experience more symptoms. An age standardized asymptomatic proportion would be more appropriate in that case. Third, the presence of symptoms in cases with COVID-19 may correlate with other factors unrelated to age including prior health conditions such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, immunosuppression. Therefore, more detailed data documenting the baseline health of the individuals including the presence of underlying diseases or comorbidities would be useful to remove the bias in estimates of the asymptomatic proportion.

70229,"In this paper, we proposed a novel COVID-19 transmission model incorporating the intervention measures implemented in China. Particularly, we adopted two novel function forms which dynamically captured the real-time endemic situation. The first one is the contact rate, c(t), which was assumed to be dependent on the cumulative number of confirmed cases to better quantify the varied interventions and self-protection measures. The other one is the contact tracing rate, which was dependent on the number of new cases. We evaluated the impact of partial lifting control measures on COVID-19 transmission. Our results show that relieve self-protection too early may lead to the spread of the virus for a longer time and more people would be infected, and may even lead to the mass transmission of the virus again. The reduction of the emergency response level does not mean that people can be off guard. At least until the end of March, life will not be able to return to normal. In the process of recovery of production and life, we should pay attention to take protective measures to minimize the contact between people, such as wearing masks and trying to avoid crowded places to cut the risk of catching coronavirus. By calculating the effective reproduction ratio, we assert that people's contact rate should be kept below 30% of the normal level and the lower the better. The forecasts presented are based on the assumption that there are no imported cases from Hubei and other infected regions. The WHO recently upgraded the global risk of the epidemic to 'very high'. New endemic foci outside China are formed, such as South Korea, Italy, Iran, Japan, etc. Although the current endemic situation in China is under control, population migration cross country border should be taken into consideration when we modify the updated controlling policy of COVID-19. With the development of the epidemic situation in other countries in the world, it is very important to maintain and strengthen the quarantine of entry personnel. The impact of international mobility on the transmission of COVID-19 will be studied in our future works. We concentrated on the epidemic situation in mainland China excluding Hubei province is due to the significant differences between Wuhan, Hubei, and the rest of the country. In Wuhan, Hubei, the origin of the new emerging disease COVID-19, it took much longer time to recognize and understand the disease transmission than other regions. It requires certain time from unknown to known. Therefore, the data accuracy in Wuhan, Hubei is a major issue for parameters' calibration. In addition, the sudden large outbreak in Wuhan, Hubei exhausted all medical resources in a short time. A more targeted model considering medical resource capacity will be anticipated in the future. In conclusion, to ensure the COVID-19 epidemic ending rapidly, it is necessary to maintain the current integrated control intervention and self-protection measures,   ()   .   including travel restriction, quarantine of entry, contact tracing followed by quarantine and isolation and reduction of contact, like wearing masks, etc. People should be fully aware of the real-time epidemic situation and keep sufficient personal protection until April.

70250,"The world has recently undergone the most ambitious mitigation effort in a century, consisting of wide-spread quarantines aimed at preventing the spread of COVID-19. The use of influential epidemiological models of COVID-19 helped to encourage decision makers to take drastic non-pharmaceutical interventions. Yet, inherent in these models are often assumptions that the active interventions are static, e.g., that social distancing is enforced until infections are minimized, which can lead to inaccurate predictions that are ever evolving as new data is assimilated. We present a methodology to dynamically guide the active intervention by shifting the focus from viewing epidemiological models as systems that evolve in autonomous fashion to control systems with an ""input"" that can be varied in time in order to change the evolution of the system. We show that a safety-critical control approach to COVID-19 mitigation gives active intervention policies that formally guarantee the safe evolution of compartmental epidemiological models. This perspective is applied to current US data on cases while taking into account reduction of mobility, and we find that it accurately describes the current trends when time delays associated with incubation and testing are incorporated. Optimal active intervention policies are synthesized to determine future mitigations necessary to bound infections, hospitalizations, and death, both at national and state levels. We therefore provide means in which to model and modulate active interventions with a view toward the phased reopenings that are currently beginning across the US and the world in a decentralized fashion. This framework can be converted into public policies, accounting for the fractured landscape of COVID-19 mitigation in a safety-critical fashion.","This perspective is applied to current US data on cases while taking into account reduction of mobility, and we find that it accurately describes the current trends when time delays associated with incubation and testing are incorporated.<q>We show that a safety-critical control approach to COVID-19 mitigation gives active intervention policies that formally guarantee the safe evolution of compartmental epidemiological models.<q>The use of influential epidemiological models of COVID-19 helped to encourage decision makers to take drastic non-pharmaceutical interventions.

70273,"A novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) emerged in China in December 2019. The virus, which is caused by SARS-CoV-2, rapidly spread to over 210 countries causing over 4 million confirmed cases and 275,000 deaths globally (as of May 8, 2020) . Although there are currently no safe and effective vaccine for use in humans, numerous concerted global efforts are underway aimed at developing such vaccine. In fact, a number of candidate vaccines are undergoing advanced stages of clinical trials. One of the most promising of these efforts is the candidate vaccine being developed by a research group at Oxford University, which is expected to be available as early as January 2021 (or, latest, by the spring of 2021). We developed a mathematical model for assessing the the potential community-wide impact of a hypothetical imperfect vaccine against the COVID-19 pandemic in the US. The model we developed, which takes the form of a deterministic system of nonlinear differential equations, was parametrized using COVID-19 data for the entire US, as well as for the US states of New York and Florida. The hypothetical vaccine was assumed to offer imperfect protective efficacy against the acquisition of COVID-19 infection. The model we developed was rigorously analysed to gain insight into its dynamical features. These analyses reveal that the continuum of disease-free equilibria of the epidemic model is locally-asymptotically stable whenever a certain epidemiological threshold, known as the control reproduction number (denoted by R c ), is less than unity. The epidemiological implication of this result is that the COVID-19 pandemic can be effectively controlled, whenever R c < 1, if the initial sizes of the sub-populations of the model are small enough. In other words, for this setting, the routine vaccination against COVID-19 in the US can lead to the effective control of the pandemic if the efficacy and nationwide coverage of the hypothetical vaccine are high enough. In particular, if the vaccine efficacy and coverage are able to bring (and maintain) the reproduction number, R c , to a value less than unity. Furthermore, threshold quantities for the community vaccine-induced herd immunity were calculated for the entire 12 for use under a CC0 license. This article is a US Government work.

70317,"The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has sparked worldwide a range of large-scale social distancing measures to a level not seen in over one hundred years 10 . The lessons learned from the 1918-19 Spanish flu epidemic highlighted the need to implement measures early and sustained over time to reduce overall mortality 10,11 . Unless herd immunity is achieved, transmission is expected to rebound following the lift of social distancing measures. In fact, to minimize mortality and health system overload, it is estimated that some form of social distancing measures will need to be in place for up to 18 months 1, 12 , resulting in substantial impacts on the world's economy 2, 13 . In this study, we use an age-structured mathematical mode to simulate the impact of partial lockdowns -social distancing interventions targeted at specific age groups -in France as an alternative to maintaining a full lockdown. We show that while a full lockdown that achieves 60% isolation in the whole population remains the most effective strategy for minimizing both the morbidity and mortality burden of the epidemic (leading to suppression), targeting one or several age groups with higher efficiency could achieve comparable reductions while allowing important societal and economic activities to still take place. The only partial lockdown strategy that achieved suppression in our simulations was targeting young and middle ages at efficiencies higher than 60%. The impact of this strategy on the outcomes assessed (epidemic duration, death burden, days over capacity and peak of severe cases) was comparable to a complete lockdown at an efficiency higher than 40%, because these age groups (young and middle ages) contribute greatly to transmission. However, at efficiencies around such thresholds, both these strategies could have important tradeoffs in the form of longer time to stop community transmission (up to nearly two years vs. one year .

70513,"In summary, we find that one of the key features of the dynamics of the COVID-19 epidemic in Hubei Province but also in all other provinces is the robust sub-exponential rise in the number of confirmed cases according to the scaling law t µ during the first episode of the epidemic. This general, almost universal behavior is evidence that fundamental principles are at work associated with this particular epidemic that are dominated by the interplay of the contagion process with endogeneous behavioral changes in the susceptible population and external mitigation policies. We find that the generic scaling of case counts with time is independent of many other factors that often shape the time-course of an epidemic. The model defined by Eqs. (1)-(3) and discussed here indicates that this type of behavior can generally be expected if the supply of susceptible individuals is systematically decreased by means of implemented containment strategies or behavioral changes in response to information about the ongoing epidemic. Unlike contagion processes that develop without external interference at all or processes that merely lead to parametric changes in the dynamics, our analysis suggests that non-exponential growth is expected when the supply of susceptibles is depleted on a timescale comparable to the infectious period assiociated with the infection. The effective depletion of the susceptible populations on a timescale κ −1 0 in the model does not imply that the pool of susceptibles must be depleted in a physical sense. Rather, this depletion could be achieved indirectly. Containment that targets the susceptible population is a requirement for the observed algebraic scaling of case counts with time, unlike the reduction of transmission rates, or the reduction of the duration infected individuals remain infectious. Both of the latter measures address infected individuals only, which leads to a reduction of the exponential growth rate of new infections, or an exponential decay if the corresponding measures are sufficiently effective, but do not alter the functional growth behavior. The fact that scaling laws were observed in Hubei after an initial exponential phase and that an exponential phase was not observed in the other substantially affected provinces is consistent with the model predictions if one assumes that the response in the population and the effect of policies lagged the onset of the epidemic in Hubei province and was immediate in all other provinces that were in an alert status already when cases were increasing substantially in Hubei province. The model reproduces the empirical case counts in all provinces well for plausible parameter values. The quality of the reproduction of the case counts in all 29 affected provinces can be used to estimate the peak time of the number of asymptomatic or oligo-symptomatic infected individuals in the population, which is the key quantity for estimating the time when this outbreak will wane. The current analysis indicates that this peak time was reached around Feb. 7th for Hubei and within the first days of February in the remaining affected provinces. The model further suggests that the public response to the epidemic and the containment measures put in place by the Chinese administration were effective despite the increase in confirmed cases. That this behavior was universally observed in all provinces also indicates that mitigation strategies were universally effective. Based on our analysis, we argue that the implemented containment strategies should stay in effect for a longer time than the incubation period after the saturation in confirmed cases sets in for this particular outbreak. Our analysis further implies and provides evidence that mitigation strategies that target the susceptible population and induce behavioral changes at this ""end"" of the transmission process are most effective to contain an epidemic-especially in situations when asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic infectious periods are long or their duration unknown. This may be of importance for developing containment strategies in future scenarios or if the current COVID-19 epidemic were to trigger large scale outbreaks in other regions of the world by exports and subsequent proliferation. Fits were performed using the Levenberg-Marquardt method of least squares. We fixed the epidemiological parameters to duration of infection T I = 8 d and basic reproduction number R 0,free = αT I = 6.2. The population size N of each of the affected Chinese provinces was obtained from the Geonames project [20] and is listed in Tab. I. For each confirmed cases data set, we set the initial conditions X(t 0 ) = C(t 0 )/N, is the i-th pair of a province's time and aggregated confirmed case number. Since the number of unidentified infectious is unknown per definition, the prefactor I 0 /X 0 ≥ 1 was chosen as a fit parameter. The remaining fit parameters were quarantine rate κ > 0 and containment rate κ 0 > 0. For the fit procedure, Eqs. (1)-(3) were integrated using the Dormand-Prince method which implements a fourth-order Runge-Kutta method with step-size control, yielding I(t) and X(t) for every parameter configuration and every data set. The residuals were computed as We find that the model accurately reflects both the subexponential growth as well as the saturating behavior observed in the data discussed in the main text, with the obtained fit parameters displayed in Tab. I. For the 9 majorly affected provinces and the aggregated data over all provinces except Hubei, the quarantine probability is found to have similar values of Q = 0.6 ± 0.1. The public containment leverage is fluctuating more strongly with values ranging between P = 0.07 and P = 1, where generally, lower values appear concurrently with a higher quarantine probability, which suggests that stronger quarantine implementation requires less public . CC-BY-ND 4.0   author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity. is the (which was not peer-reviewed)  . 18.20024414  isolation. Yet, we advise not to overinterpret the values of these fit parameters, as many different parameter values generate similar developments of confirmed cases. As we fixed the population size to be equal to the total population of the respective provinces, one might also ask how system size changes the results-for instance, if the outbreak is contained in a small region of a province, the effective population available to the transmission process will be substantially smaller. Therefore, we repeated the fit procedure with N as a free fit parameter to find that the form of X(t) is not altered substantially for different values of N, while I(t) can vary more strongly as reflected by a larger variation in I 0 . This result suggests that the estimation of the number of infecteds is associated with a larger uncertainty. The general shape of I(t), however, remains stable such that an inference of the peak time of unidentified infecteds is reasonable. Furthermore, the model favours larger values of the containment rate κ 0 for larger population sizes in order to reproduce emprical data. This is a reasonable because the number of available transmission pathways grows quadratically with the population size, making it easier for the disease to spread faster. In order to still observe sub-exponential growth, a large part of the susceptible population has to be removed quickly. Consistently, we find that a decay of susceptibles is necessary to reliably obtain the observed growth behavior (i.e. P > 0, κ 0 > 0). Concerning variation in the fixed model parameters, larger values of up to R 0,free = 12 yield results similar to the ones described above when adjusting the infectious period T I to larger values, as well. For lower values of R 0,free < 6, the model fails to reproduce the scaling laws observed in the data. Similarly, the fit results are reasonably robust against variations of the duration of infection in a range of T I ∈ [6 d, 20 d] with concurrent adjustment of R 0,free . Similar effects are found for the remaining 20 affected provinces for which model fits are displayed in Fig. 3 with parameters given in Tab. II. In general, provinces with larger values of public containment leverage P exhibit a stronger agreement with the hypothesis of algebraic growth. All data and the analysis material is available online [21] . Appendix B: Case-number development in early phase of the epidemic In a typical outbreak scenario only few people are infected initially, such that S(0) = 1 − ε and I(0) = with ε 1, which implies that the depletion of susceptibles available to the transmission process will be dominated by shutdown policies. This assumption effectively linearizes Eq. (1), yielding the solution Further integration of the linearized Eq. (2) yields Table II . Fit parameters as described in Sec. III, fixed population size N, and resulting effective basic reproduction number R 0,eff for the remaining affected provinces, decreasingly ordered by largest case number. The infectious period T I and the basic reproduction number R 0,free = αT I were fixed to values T I = 8 d and R 0,free = 6.2, respectively. For small values of t we can expand the exponent to obtain the approximate growth function Here, the first factor implies that quarantining infecteds merely decreases the rate with which their number will grow exponentially, while the second term suppresses the whole transmission process well enough to alter the growth behavior. This implies that public shutdown policies facilitate epidemic containment in a more effective way than quarantine measures. ","In summary, we find that one of the key features of the dynamics of the COVID-19 epidemic in Hubei Province but also in all other provinces is the robust sub-exponential rise in the number of confirmed cases according to the scaling law t µ during the first episode of the epidemic.<q>This general, almost universal behavior is evidence that fundamental principles are at work associated with this particular epidemic that are dominated by the interplay of the contagion process with endogeneous behavioral changes in the susceptible population and external mitigation policies.<q>We find that the generic scaling of case counts with time is independent of many other factors that often shape the time-course of an epidemic.

70521,"Current estimates of future trends in new infections in the coming weeks largely compromise the capacity of the Spanish health system, as it happened for Italy. This is especially critical in particular for intensive care units from the end of March [21] . Our projections for the forthcoming evolution in the COVID-19 epidemic curve for Spain show a pessimistic scenario unless current social distancing measures are effective. With the estimates at hand, over 1.4 million people would be clinically diagnosed at the disease maximum and over 100.000 resulting deaths. Imposing stricter measures under the current uncertainties seems a logical preventive option given the considerable gains in terms of infected and casualties, even at moderate increases in alpha. Assessment of total country changes by means of aggregated and CCAA disaggregated data estimates, provides similar dynamical evolution despite different absolute values. Gaining extra time for exerting alternative interventions, such as temporary increases in public health responses, or increasing the capacity of massively screening the population in order to gain an accurate value of the real prevalence of SARS-CoV-2, or develop disease treatment strategies seem a logical conclusion. While two of the most populated CCAA (namely Catalunya with roughly 7.7M people and Madrid Community, with 6.7M people) are already in the lead in terms of epidemic progression, other similarly populated regions lag only a few days entering a similar slope in their respective epidemic growths. The largest population density in Madrid compared to other CCAA together with its more advanced epidemic progression cast urgent attention on the evolution of this highly active epidemic focus. Those regions where the outbreak was initiated earlier (e.g. Madrid, Catalunya, Euskadi and Navarra) or appear to have more connectivity to the initial foci and largest population density tend to show earlier peaks. Those regions yet on early stages of the exponential increase are those where strong initial social isolation measures (therefore protection of the population), would have largest effects in resulting infected ( Figure 2 ). Figure 1 is very sensitive to the latest data used, as these data are the ones governing the changes in trends, therefore errors in reporting or other large uncertainties associated with these values may dramatically alter the final outcome in terms of number of infected and associated mortality. For the curve to happen as shown, the simulation assumes the initial conditions hold, therefore if that were not the case and measures were lifted before the epidemic reaches R 0 ≈ 1, infections might rise again. Improvements can be achieved with a more complete integration of time delay coordinates in classical SEIR models [6] . This way, both the incubation period and the period before recovery, as well as the precise role of asymptomatic population can be better represented at times when these information is highly uncertain. A substantial gain in the epidemic projection in the form of reduced infections in the population would already be achieved with a four-times rise in the efficacy of the control situation we had around March 9 − 16. This was the time when social distancing/confinement was imposed (March 13). Time will show to which extent current measures manage to increase the value of alpha. Strict containment measures clearly show drastic effect on the epidemic progression and a substantial reduction in both infected and to a lesser extent, deaths. The Covid-19 pandemic is exerting an unprecedented stress on the public health systems of many countries. Those at major risk now are Italy and Spain, and for the latter, efficacy of the partial confinement actions taken is yet unknown. Under this situation, we implemented a modified SEIR compartmental model accounting for infection from undiagnosed individuals and for different levels of population isolation, to evaluate effects of contacts reduction in the epidemic temporal dynamics. Among the advantages of the implemented model, it should be noted that despite the simplicity of the hypotheses, the adjustments obtained were accurate and the projections made do not differ much from those other of more complex models. Also instantaneous increment of cumulative diagnosed people depends on the history of cumulative infected people, by which the latent period can be taken into consideration. The results of the implemented control scenarios show that a drastic isolation of the susceptible population should be implemented as soon as possible. For even not so drastic increases (two or three times the current rate) show also significant reductions in the incidence of cases. The adjustments made in different CCAA also serve to verify the effectiveness of the isolation hypothesis for the most affected communities (Madrid and Catalunya). They also serve as a basis for timely action in those communities that do not yet have a significant number of cases that jeopardises their health systems. Policymakers should weigh in the values and ethical considerations of employing now maximum strength in actions to help reduce the slope of 5   author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

However, our study indicates that a three-weeks interruption of labour activities, thereby a drastic reduction in contacts, could end the current epidemic in around two months and drastically reduce both the burden of this disease, and much lower the toll of lives. Our results could also provide suggestions for the prevention and control of the COVID-19 outbreaks in different countries and locations such as Argentina lagging the current epidemic wave in Spain. Firstly, the isolation is essential in controlling the spread of SARS-CoV-2. With the isolation rate corresponding to a 13 (per day) percent of the population, it is possible to bring the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 to controllable levels in around two months. However, our model does not consider space explicitly as we approached aggregated data. This lack of spatial granularity may affect the accuracy of simulations when the spread of infections in a territory reaches and takes off in a populated city. The former might alter results producing more new cases than expected. Spatial modelling should also be incorporated explicitly and extension of this modelling approach to incorporate movement of individuals should follow. Results should be interpreted with care as projections at these initial stages of the epidemic are very dependent on the quality of data, with small changes in observed values producing large variations in trends. However, even with this limitation in mind, the magnitude of positive increments in cases suggests these results are strong. Variable isolation strength measures can be tested with this model and inform governments of the most probable effects of their actions on the initial course of the COVID-19 disease. author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

70632,"We present a model of COVID-19 in a population with different risk groups and different levels of economic vulnerability to public policy aimed at preventing disease spread. We focus our model on a situation where disease is ongoing and quarantine measures are already in place. By modeling our population with different risk groups and economic groups, we are able to produce specific policy suggestions that allow for a finer targeting of the spread of COVID-19. The individuals most vulnerable to COVID-19 are primarily those who can be protected from the disease without crippling the economy. We suggest stringent lockdowns for higher-risk groups. Our simulations show that in order to protect the most vulnerable, any lockdown relaxation must be gradual, even for the less vulnerable. Beyond the short-term, lockdown policy does not need to be as severe for lowerrisk groups. Quarantine restrictions can lessen over time for lower-risk people while still minimizing deaths. Lessening quarantine restrictions allows the economy to recover to −30 % of pre-restriction productivity, as opposed to −34 % when quarantine restrictions are left in place. It is important that policy relaxation be gradual, as this limits the spread of disease, and can allow for less restrictive measures in the future. In real-world terms, the gradual relaxation suggested by our model can correspond to the lifting of restrictions on in-person work operations several industries at a time, or to gradually increasing the number of low-risk people allowed to gather in one place. These results also suggest that optimal policies may differ in various countries independent of the level of disease spread and healthcare capacity. For instance, in countries with more vulnerable economies that have a younger population, the consequences from disease may be less than in other countries, while consequences from lockdown policies may be higher than in other countries. We also see that contagiousness of asymptomatic infected individuals (β) has an important effect on disease spread and mortality, and this suggests that strictly enforcing quarantines is especially important for policymakers to prioritize. If policymakers prioritize short-term economic productivity more, their quarantine policies may lead to many times more deaths and hospitalizations with minimal short-term economic gain. Our results demonstrate that keeping a stringent quarantine on at least a substantial portion of the population is necessary to avert large numbers of deaths. More investigation is required as to how to keep such a quarantine sustainable over time, both through targeted relaxation, as we suggest, but also through safe provision of services to the quarantined and increased infrastructure for at-home economic productivity. (25) More workers may be required for maintaining a quarantined population over time. Additionally, continued compliance with quarantine may require a variety of measures, including enforcement, education from public health officials, and infrastructure for alternatives to traditional social and entertainment options. Furthermore, policymakers should use other tools to supplement quarantine policy, including contact tracing and other containment measures. Successful quarantine policy can more quickly bring disease levels down to a level where more targeted tools can control future outbreaks. Our simulations suggest that quarantine policy alone cannot end a pandemic without a level of enforcement that may not be realistic, and one that necessitates extreme economic costs. Thus, policymakers should quickly incentivize vaccines and other medical treatments. Our study has several limitations. Since there is no recent data on longterm health quarantines, it is unknown how individuals will react to lengthy restrictions related to infectious disease. Once more information on individuals' responses becomes available, their behavior should be incorporated into later models. We also do not model any individual-level differences in behavior or disease spread. This model could also be modified to incorporate the effects of testing and to have probability of infection depend on job type. Our model does not allow for any differences in disease spread between new and repeated contacts. (26; 27; 28) Additionally, due to the newness of COVID-19, the exact disease parameters and the effects of seasonality are not precisely known. (29; 30) Because of the uncertainty surrounding disease parameters, which change as the COVID-19 situation progresses, our numbers should not be taken as literal predictions, but rather as illustrating the consequences of different policy approaches. During a fatal infectious disease outbreak of lengthy duration, making policy decisions with longer term consequences in mind is essential. Our model provides a framework for making such decisions that takes into account differences within the population and disease changes that may occur over time. We provide evidence about what quarantine policies may allow for minimal deaths while maximizing economic productivity. We find that once infection levels are somewhat controlled, very gradual relaxation of the restrictions on younger groups can minimize health consequences and economic damage. the manuscript.

The basic reproductive number, R0, for SARS was determined to be 3 with 95% CI being 2 to 4 (Dye and Gay, 2003) . However, contrary to public knowledge, the earlier reports from the COVID-19 outbreak provided a R0 number less than or equal to that for SARS Wu et al., 2020; Zhou et al., 2020) . This may have resulted from an inaccurate number of clinical cases due to delayed clinical visits, overloading of clinical resources, and a low sensitivity of the COVID-19 diagnosis kit. With more clinical reports published, the case numbers were adjusted based on the information presented, which gave a more accurate transmission estimation. The basic reproductive number for COVID-19 was then found to be 5.6, which is substantially higher than that for SARS. In an enclosed and crowded environment, the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 was thought to significantly increase. The Diamond Princess Cruise provided an excellent case study as the development of COVID-19 on the cruise line has a clear infectious source, exposure time, quarantine time, and total number of infections. The transport of the virus through the central air conditioning system and the ineffective quarantine of the ship's crew, however, raised some concerns. Nevertheless, a conservative estimation of transmission using only 50% of the confirmed cases has proven the high transmission rate in an enclosed crowded ship. This suggested that the initial offense within the Huanan Seafood Market could be at a high level. The likely zoonotic origin also raised questions about additional sources other than the Huanan Seafood Market. This argument was partially supported by several early cases with no .

Rigorous statistical models were used to test the hypothesis of a second zoonotic source, and the development of case numbers did not support this hypothesis. Though our model cannot completely exclude the possibility of additional zoonotic sources, it suggested a minimal effect by such sources. Furthermore, the model did not support the constant zoonotic infection within Huanan Seafood Market throughout December. If the zoonotic transgression was sustained, a larger number of infected cases would have been observed. Based on the data from the Diamond Process Cruise, the transmission rate was higher in an enclosed and crowded place, like the Huanan Seafood Market. However, similar transmission rate was observed in December as in January. This is likely due to the market's daytime only operating hours, reducing the contact time. This result further suggested similar transmission rate between generations, which was confirmed by comparing the transmission in Wuhan and other cities. High mutation rates have been observed in the genome sequences collected from more than 100 human specimens. However, the effect that these mutations have on transmission may not be observed in such a short time period. The Chinese government took unprecedented measures to fight the new epidemic and those measures raised global controversy for their necessity and effectiveness. The restrictive travel ban and home isolation enforced in Wuhan was expected to largely decrease the transmission and prevent further spread of the disease within weeks. Nevertheless, the coronavirus infection was continuously increasing exponentially in late January and early February in Wuhan. In this model, an increase in the transmission rate (from 0.44 to 0.54) was observed during this time period. It suggested that the travel ban and home isolation cannot effectively prevent the disease spread. This was likely due to the probable cross-contamination in the long waiting lines at the .

The limited medical resources only allowed patients with severe symptoms to be hospitalized. A low sensitivity of diagnosis further increased the waiting time for a confirmed case. Insufficient hospital beds resulted in a large number of home isolated patients, often leading to family infection. Observing the tremendous epidemic, the Chinese government built square cabin hospitals with more than twenty thousand beds and quickly moved all patients into these hospitals. All people with suspected symptoms or with close patient contacts were isolated in the government-managed quarantine stations. This comprehensive quarantine method has successfully reduced the transmission rate by 81.5%, and also greatly shortened the infectious time interval. The analysis in this study showed that the epidemic can be controlled within a few weeks if the comprehensive quarantine was conducted on January 20 th or earlier. Concurrently with the development of this manuscript, it was reported that South Korea had more than 1,000 home isolations in the city of Daegu for a suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection. It is highly recommended that other countries immediately quarantine all suspected patients. This model was developed using the cases up to February 20 th . As the case numbers increase, the transmission features may change and some of the assumptions, such as the infectious period, may vary. The cases reported in Wuhan were known to be less than the actual number in January due to overloading of clinical resources and the low sensitivity of diagnosis. This study attempted to overcome these limitations by using the clinical information verified by several reports and relying only on the beginning and ending cases. Therefore, this model tended to reflect the real trend of this critical epidemic and it provides more convincing evidence to guide the control of this disease by the government. .

70827,"Abstract SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19, emerged in Wuhan, China in December 2019 and spread rapidly throughout the world. Understanding the introductions of this new coronavirus in different settings may assist control efforts and the establishment of frameworks to support rapid response in future infectious disease outbreaks. We investigated the first four weeks of emergence of the SARS-CoV-2 virus in Scotland after the first case reported on the 1st March 2020. We obtained full genome sequences from 452 individuals with a laboratory-confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19, representing 20% of all cases until 1st April 2020 (n=2310). This permitted a genomic epidemiology approach to study the introductions and spread of the SARS-2 virus in Scotland. From combined phylogenetic and epidemiological analysis, we estimated at least 113 introductions of SARS-CoV-2 into Scotland during this period. Clusters containing multiple sequences suggestive of onward transmission occurred in 48/86 (56%). 42/86 (51%) clusters had no known international travel history indicating undetected introductions. The majority of viral sequences were most closely related to those circulating in other European countries, including Italy, Austria and Spain. Travel-associated introductions of SARS-CoV-2 into Scotland predated travel restrictions in the UK and other European countries. The first local transmission occurred three days after the first case. A shift from travel-associated to sustained community transmission was apparent after only 11 days. Undetected introductions occurred prior to the first known case of COVID-19. Earlier travel restrictions and quarantine measures might have resulted in fewer introductions into Scotland, thereby reducing the number of cases and the subsequent burden on health services. The high number of introductions and transmission rates were likely to have impacted on national contact tracing efforts. Our results also demonstrate that local real-time genomic epidemiology can be used to monitor transmission clusters and facilitate control efforts to restrict the spread of COVID-19.","Abstract SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19, emerged in Wuhan, China in December 2019 and spread rapidly throughout the world.<q>Understanding the introductions of this new coronavirus in different settings may assist control efforts and the establishment of frameworks to support rapid response in future infectious disease outbreaks.<q>From combined phylogenetic and epidemiological analysis, we estimated at least 113 introductions of SARS-CoV-2 into Scotland during this period.

70860,"We have proposed a two-step model to the rise and decay of the epidemics due to the COVID-19. The model needs some input parameters to predict the time evolution up to the saturation of the probability as in equation (1) . Once the plateau is reached, given by the d ∞ parameter, the probability remains constant for some time depending on the quarantine measures or other environmental factors. For the Italian case, the first test was published on February 24 and equation (1) was fitted on March 10 before the quarantine was announced, i.e. March 14 [7] . The plateau was reached around March 24 as predicted by the model. These dates suggest that the quarantine was not effective in reducing the maximum probability and the time when this was reached. The quarantine became effective roughly 10 days after saturation. Thus we can estimate that it takes about 3 weeks before the quarantine gives an effect and the probabilities start decreasing, this is the value of t crit entering equation (2) . We can suppose that if the quarantine was announced say 14 days earlier, then the exponential decrease, equation (2) would had intercepted the rise, equation (1), earlier resulting in smaller probabilities. This is what happened to S. Korea and Japan, and it would explain the differences among countries: the later and the more feeble the quarantine the higher the probabilities and the longer the time to return to (quasi) normality. From these considerations we can estimate the time it takes for other countries also if the probability decrease is not seen yet. After reaching the top of the probability, see figure 3 , it took roughly 10 days for Italy to see the decrease. If the data shows the decreasing part then a fit using equation (2) will be performed, otherwise we use the parameters found for Italy. In figure 10 we plot the predicted total number of positives, in the same figure we plot the same quantities for the deceased.

70951,"The main finding of our study was that an infection control bundle comprising infrastructural enhancements, improved PPE and social distancing mitigated the risk of environmental contamination and transmission in a cohorted general ward setting. In our institution, the concept of a designated RSW for patients with clinical syndromes that were compatible with COVID-19 ensured that the large majority of COVID-19 cases diagnosed outside of the IW were still managed in areas where appropriate PPE, infrastructural enhancements and proper infection prevention practices (hand hygiene, environment and equipment hygiene) were in place to reduce healthcare-associated spread. Via early testing and detection, the duration of exposure in the cohorted RSW was kept relatively short (~15 hours on average), compared to the median duration of viral shedding over the clinical course. 18 Additionally, as peak viral shedding is thought to occur earlier in the clinical course during the first week of symptoms, early detection can potentially mitigate transmission risk during peak infectivity. 18 Early detection in the clinical course prior to deterioration also helped to minimise the number of AGPs performed outside of the IW setting. Indeed, although almost one-fifth of the index cases subsequently deteriorated and required intubation, this occurred after the patients had been already transferred into the IW. This was important given the increased potential of healthcare-associated transmission during aerosolization caused by AGPs. For instance, delayed detection in a single patient that required intubation and mechanical ventilation prior to the diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia resulted in the quarantine of 41 HCWs for 2 weeks, due to a prolonged duration in the general ward prior to detection 4 In the cluster of COVID-19 cases reported in this study, there were several risk factors: the duration of the index patient's stay in the RSW was the longest (>48 hours) and staff had previously observed social mingling between the unmasked patients in the cubicle. Though healthcare-associated transmission could not be definitively proven, these findings reinforce the importance of a bundle of interventions in reducing risk of COVID-19 transmission: social distancing in high-risk areas, early detection to minimise exposure duration; and usage of appropriate PPE in higher-risk areas to minimise HCW exposure. A short duration of stay in the dedicated general ward, reduction of the number of beds in cohorted cubicles, and usage of full PPE minimised the total numbers of patient and HCW exposures. Indeed, although a total of 28 hitherto unsuspected cases of COVID-19 were picked up in the RSW, there were only 45 patient closecontacts. In comparison, delayed detection of a single case of COVID-19 in the setting of a multi-bedded cohorted general ward resulted in the exposure of as many as 71 patients, with all occupants of a cohort cubicle deemed to be in close contact and requiring quarantine. 5 In our institution itself, a single case of COVID-19 in the non-modified general ward resulted in the potential exposure of 18 patients. 12 As patient close contacts require quarantine in suitable isolation facilities within hospital if medically unfit for discharge, 5 minimising the number of patient close contacts is crucial in relieving additional strain on hospital resources during an ongoing outbreak. Persistence of SARS-CoV-2 in the environment, in aerosols and on surfaces, 19,20 provides a potential vector for transmission. Multiple studies report extensive environmental contamination of inanimate surfaces in the immediate environment of COVID-19 cases (patients' rooms and toilets) prior to cleaning. 13.21 However, the bulk of these studies are conducted in AIIRs; the applicability of these studies to the general ward setting may potentially be confounded by differences in ventilation, airflow and room layout (such as the presence of anterooms to segregate the patient's immediate environment from common areas). 22 A small study that tested environmental samples from 2 cohorted 4-bed cubicles on a general ward detected SARS-CoV-2 in 13.6% of samples collected, generally from near-patient environments; however, the COVID-19 patients placed in these cohorted cubicles were no longer symptomatic at the point of sampling. 23 Uniquely, our study provided the opportunity to investigate the extent of environmental contamination in COVID-19 patients housed in a general ward setting, early on at the point of initial admission; although this was modified by the effects of our infection control bundle. The rate of environmental contamination reported in our study was low; less than 5% of environmental samples tested positive, compared to other studies which reported rates of 15-50%, mainly from AIIRs. [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] This could potentially be attributed to the effect of the infection control bundle comprising infrastructural enhancements and social distancing that was introduced in our designated wards; though the precise contribution of each component of the bundle could not be assessed. Notably, though, in our study the majority of positive environmental surveillance samples came from patients who were on supplemental oxygen in the RSW. This may be related to increased risk of droplet dispersion in patients on supplemental oxygen 26, 27 or the inability to comply with mandatory usage of face masks. 28 Our study had several limitations. Only patient and HCW contacts with fever or respiratory symptoms were tested with rt-PCR, hence the possibility of asymptomatic infection among the exposed patients and HCWs cannot be entirely excluded. As the diagnostic yield of PCR testing for SARS-CoV-2 is likely dependent on the quality of sampling, 29 cases may have been missed due to sampling issues; however, all symptomatic close-contacts were tested at least twice, 24 hours apart. The follow-up of potentially exposed patients and HCWs to test for seroconversion, when such tests are developed, would be useful. For environmental sampling, we were unable to perform viral culture; hence the viability of the virus found from environmental samples could not be ascertained. We were also unable to perform air sampling for index cases, as upon confirmation of COVID-19, cases were immediately moved to the IW to reduce risk of transmission. In conclusion, over a 3-month period, our institution implemented a bundle of interventions to reduce risk of intra-hospital transmission of COVID-19 in a multi-bedded cohorted general ward setting, through the implementation of an infection control bundle comprising infrastructural enhancements, improved PPE, and social distancing between patients. Routine testing for patients presenting with clinical syndromes compatible with COVID-19 allowed for early detection and early isolation, reducing the duration of exposure in the general ward setting and further mitigating the risk of healthcare-associated transmission.  ","The main finding of our study was that an infection control bundle comprising infrastructural enhancements, improved PPE and social distancing mitigated the risk of environmental contamination and transmission in a cohorted general ward setting.<q>In our institution, the concept of a designated RSW for patients with clinical syndromes that were compatible with COVID-19 ensured that the large majority of COVID-19 cases diagnosed outside of the IW were still managed in areas where appropriate PPE, infrastructural enhancements and proper infection prevention practices (hand hygiene, environment and equipment hygiene) were in place to reduce healthcare-associated spread.<q>18 Additionally, as peak viral shedding is thought to occur earlier in the clinical course during the first week of symptoms, early detection can potentially mitigate transmission risk during peak infectivity.

70976,"In Fig. 1 , daily numbers of diagnosed COVID-19 cases who had recently returned from Lombardy are shown together with the temporal distribution of passengers flying in each direction. We find that~3% of travellers who returned to Norway from Lombardy between February 21st and March 1st were eventually diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection. We find a clear increase in the fraction of infected travellers during the period, from~1% on Feb 21st-25th with an exponential increase to~9% on March 1st (Fig. 2) . Similarly, we calculate the incidence rate per person-day among Norwegians in Lombardy to be roughly 3.4e-3 on Feb 21st-25th, up to 0.02 per person-day on March 1st. These results confirm that COVID-19 infections were contracted at very high rates by travellers to Lombardy in late February. . CC-BY 4.0    Travellers returning to Norway from Lombardy contracted COVID-19 at extreme rates in the period spanning February 21st and March 1st, with a clear uptick in transmission in the middle of the period. The infection risk associated with international air travel is impossible to predict, as reported cases in a region might be only a fraction of the true case load, and also because the infection pressure in tourist destinations might be several fold higher than the overall pressure in a region. In Norway, this is also supported by extreme rates of infections among tourists returning from Austria in February and March, despite a low number of reported cases in the country at the time.

Being male, active working, having a garden and practicing regular physical exercise seem to be relevant during this particular period. On contrary, higher periods of media consumptions seem to be related with poor mental health indicators. Previous studies reported an adverse effect on mental health for younger Chinese participants (12 to 21 years) during COVID-19 outbreak, mostly students . They proposed that their routine was severely impacted by COVID-19 in comparison to older adults. Our results also point to a higher risk for younger individuals, despite the lack of children and adolescents in our sample. Other authors have also demonstrated that depression and anxiety levels were higher in individuals under 35 years of age (Huang and Zhao, 2020) . Anxiety has been demonstrated to increase with increased concerns about the impact of the virus on economic and academic domains and decreased social support in college students (Cao et al., 2020) , further supporting our findings. However, past research in China reported decreased distress in individuals under 18 years of age, but also enhanced distress for adults with age between 18 and 30 years in line with our findings (Qiu et al., 2020) . Our findings demonstrate that males are associated with less symptomatology. In accordance with such findings, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), distress, anxiety and depression symptoms were higher in Chinese women during the pandemic (Lai et al., 2020; Qiu et al., 2020) . Contrary to our results, higher education in Chinese individuals was associated with increased distress during the effects of COVID-19 (Qiu et al., 2020) . These authors suggested that more educated people are more aware of their health. However, previous literature supports our results (Bracke et al., 2014; Brooks et al., 2020) . Our results agree with past research demonstrating that working at home or working without restrictions when compared to not working was associated with better mental health, life satisfaction and lower distress in Chinese individuals during the COVID-19 pandemic (S.

71127,"Background: The rapid expansion of the current COVID-19 outbreak has caused a global pandemic but how quarantine-based measures can prevent or suppress an outbreak without other more intrusive interventions has not yet been determined. Hong Kong had a massive influx of travellers from mainland China, where the outbreak began, during the early expansion period coinciding with the Lunar New Year festival; however, the spread of the virus has been relatively limited even without imposing severe control measures, such as a full city lockdown. Understanding how quarantine measures in Hong Kong were effective in limiting community spread can provide us with valuable insights into how to suppress an outbreak. However, challenges exist in evaluating the effects of quarantine on COVID-19 transmission dynamics in Hong Kong due to the fact that the effects of border control have to be also taken into account. Methods: We have developed a two-layered susceptible-exposed-infectious-quarantined-recovered (SEIQR) meta-population model which can estimate the effects of quarantine on virus transmissibility after stratifying infections into imported and subsequent community infections, in a region closely connected to the outbreak's source. We fitted the model to both imported and local confirmed case data with symptom onset from 18 January to 29 February 2020 in Hong Kong, together with daily transportation data and the transmission dynamics of COVID-19 from Wuhan and mainland China. After model fitting, epidemiological parameters and the timing of the start of quarantine for infected cases were estimated. Results: The model estimated that the reproduction number of COVID-19 in Hong Kong was 0.76 (95% CI, 0.66 to 0.86), achieved through quarantining infected cases -0.57 days (95% CI, -4.21 - 3.88) relative to symptom onset, with an estimated incubation time of 5.43 days (95% CI, 1.30 - 9.47). However, if delaying the quarantine start by more than 1.43 days, the reproduction number would be greater than one, making community spread more likely. The model also determined the timing of the start of quarantine necessary in order to suppress an outbreak in the presence of population immunity. Conclusion: The results suggest that the early quarantine for infected cases before symptom onset is a key factor to prevent COVID-19 outbreak.","Understanding how quarantine measures in Hong Kong were effective in limiting community spread can provide us with valuable insights into how to suppress an outbreak.<q>Background: The rapid expansion of the current COVID-19 outbreak has caused a global pandemic but how quarantine-based measures can prevent or suppress an outbreak without other more intrusive interventions has not yet been determined.<q>Hong Kong had a massive influx of travellers from mainland China, where the outbreak began, during the early expansion period coinciding with the Lunar New Year festival; however, the spread of the virus has been relatively limited even without imposing severe control measures, such as a full city lockdown.

71236,"Difficulties assessing and predicting the current outbreak of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 can be traced, in part, to the limitations of a static description of a dynamic system. Fourier transforming the time-domain data of infections and fatalities into the frequency domain makes the dynamics easily accessible. Defining a quantity like the case fatality as a spectral density allows a more sensible comparison between different countries and demographics during an ongoing outbreak. Such a case fatality informs not only how many of the confirmed cases end up as fatalities, but also when. For COVID-19, knowing this time and using the entire case fatality spectrum allows determining that an outbreak had entered a steady-state (most likely its end) about 14 days before this is obvious from time-domain data. The lag between confirmations and deaths also helps to estimate the effectiveness of contact management: The larger the lag, the less time the average confirmed person had to infect people before quarantine.","Difficulties assessing and predicting the current outbreak of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 can be traced, in part, to the limitations of a static description of a dynamic system.<q>Fourier transforming the time-domain data of infections and fatalities into the frequency domain makes the dynamics easily accessible.<q>Defining a quantity like the case fatality as a spectral density allows a more sensible comparison between different countries and demographics during an ongoing outbreak.

To supplement previous research on psychological effects after quarantine, this research will investigate the effects of quarantine amid COVID-19. We adopt a sentiment analysis approach to analyze the psychological state changes of 1,278 quarantined persons with 214,874 tweets over four weeks spanning the period before, during, and after quarantine. We formed a control group of 1,278 unquarantined persons with 250,198 tweets. The tweets of both groups are analyzed by matching with a lexicon to measure the anxious depression level changes over time. We discovered a clear pattern of psychological changes for quarantined persons. Anxious depression levels significantly increased as quarantine starts, but gradually diminished as it progresses. However, anxious depression levels resurged after a 14-day quarantine. It was found that quarantine has a negative impact on the mental health of quarantined and unquarantined people. Whilst quarantine is deemed necessary, proper interventions such as emotion management should be introduced to mitigate its adverse psychological impacts.","We rely on social distancing measures such as quarantine and isolation to contain the COVID-19.<q>However, the negative psychological effects of these measures are non-negligible.<q>To supplement previous research on psychological effects after quarantine, this research will investigate the effects of quarantine amid COVID-19.

71393,"Background: The emerging SARS-CoV-2 virus has caused a global pandemic characterized by superspreader events. Heterogeneity in transmission risk is a known phenomenon in infectious diseases and was also seen in SARS and MERS outbreaks since 2003. The pandemic has led countries to control the pandemic spread using unprecedented severe mitigation strategies that include quarantine and lock-down. This has has been highly successful in terms of halting the spread, but had enormous socioeconomic cost. We set out to theoretically explore whether a model that includes the phenomenon of superspreaders may guide us towards a cost-effective mitigation strategy. Methods: We developed an agent-based model that includes persons that spread the disease far more readily than other persons. This allow us to investigate effect of containment strategies in both a random SEIR like scenario, and in a transmission model that work with structured society. Our model considered even contact patterns in three settings: home, work and a category of ""other"" settings representing diffuse social contacts. We introduced superspreaders either as a fixed proportion of the population, or as a broad spectrum of infectivity. For each choice, the model was then calibrated to an overall realistic daily growth rate of 23 percentage. As sensitivity analyses we varied the fraction of superspreaders as well the distribution of their infectivity. To compare the simulation findings for each mitigation scenario we considered the maximum daily ICU utility. Results: As expected, without mitigation imposed, the inclusion of superspreaders does not meaningfully change the epidemic trajectory. However when introducing mitigation strategies imposed on each of the three settings, we find that the presence of superspreaders made a substantial difference. The simulations demonstrate that the best strategy is to focus on limiting contacts in the other category. This in particular suggests that limiting diffuse social contacts in settings such as bars, transportation, restaurants, parties, concerts and lecture halls is far more effective than limiting the same amount of contact events in the home and work setting. Conclusions: To appreciate effect of heterogeneity in various social spheres we need to rethink disease transmission models. ng so, we found that wide distribution of infectivity favours strategies that reduces the max, while leaving the typical behaviour undisturbed. We found that most workplaces may be opened without much influence on the epidemic, while one could snuff out transmission with an effective avoidance of other contacts. Interestingly, including a consideration of superspreaders can help explain the dramatic success of even moderate lock-down strategies as that practiced in Denmark and Sweden. And it points to the need to avoid mass gatherings until either flock immunity has been achieved or an effective vaccine is available.","Background: The emerging SARS-CoV-2 virus has caused a global pandemic characterized by superspreader events.<q>Heterogeneity in transmission risk is a known phenomenon in infectious diseases and was also seen in SARS and MERS outbreaks since 2003.<q>The pandemic has led countries to control the pandemic spread using unprecedented severe mitigation strategies that include quarantine and lock-down.

71399,"Shaanxi province is located northwest of China, adjacent to Hubei in the south. Therefore, except for Xi'an city, the capital of Shaanxi, many confirmed cases are in the southern part of Shaanxi province. It is interesting to note that Health Commission of Shaanxi Province released the case number every day with very detailed information, by which we can know when and who infected whom. Then except for the new reported (or cumulative) number of confirmed cases, we can get the daily number of individuals who are in latent (or quarantined latent), infected and hospitalized compartments, which gives the evolution process of the epidemic in Shaanxi province. We can get the durations from illness onset to the first medical visit, to the hospitalization, and to confirmation of the case. These durations are relatively smaller than those for mainland China or Hubei province [3, 4, 6, 8, 11, 14, 17] , which implies that the control measures implemented in Shaanxi are timely and medical resources are relatively sufficient. From the detailed data description, we can obtain the transmission chains over the time, which enable to calculate the control reproduction number under the implementation of stringent control strategies. The mean control reproduction number ranges from 1.48 to 1.69, and the distribution of these chains agrees well with the effective reproduction number. Note that the effective number has been declining, and is less than unity since January 27 th 2020. Recently it has stabilized at almost zero, meaning that no new infections occur, which seem to be in line with real data, as shown in Figures 1 and 7 [7] . In this study we extend our deterministic model framework [9, [18] [19] [20] ] to a discrete system incorporating stochastic modeling of imported cases to represent the relatively small number of cases observed in the Shaanxi province, with about half of them being imported cases. It is worth noting that traced data is around 7 days ahead of the reported ones, as illustrated in Figure 1 (A). Moreover, detailed data records revealed that the time interval between the first visit to a doctor and confirmation was longer, with a median of around 4 days. Then, the number of reported cases is not suitable to identify the model or estimate the parameters due to delays such as report delay, confirmation delay, etc. Therefore, it is not accurate to associate the number of confirmed cases with the number of cases in hospital, which may seriously overestimate the scale of the epidemic. Therefore, the multiple traced data sets have been employed to identify the proposed discrete stochastic model and estimate the unknown parameters in this work. Consequently, we use the number of individuals in E, I, and H classes form traced data rather than the newly (or cumulative) reported number to parameterize the model. We investigate the impact of population movement (resumption of work) on the potential second outbreak by using movement data from other cities to Shaanxi province. Our main results indicate that the proportion of imported cases is a key variable in order to determine   the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is .   whether the second outbreak is likely or not to occur. The greater the proportion of imported cases the larger the second outbreak has. Furthermore, intermittent importation may induce one further outbreak episode but with small peak values. From our study, we can conclude that it is very important to study the epidemic situation of COVID-19 by using data from contact tracing rather than simply using the number of confirmed cases, especially in the areas where the imported cases are the main source of infection. This can not only provide important data information for the accurate evaluation of the epidemic situation in other areas outside Hubei Province, but also provide important and accurate data supporting the evaluation of the effectiveness and timeliness of public health intervention strategies in different areas. In the present investigation, we devised a stochastic model that can be used as an important model framework and methodology for the evaluation of imported cases on local epidemic in the Shaanxi province or other similar provinces. From the data analysis, it seems that the stringent public health interventions adopted by the Chinese authorities are effective in controlling the infection. According to data from contact tracing, the first imported cases in the Shaanxi Province occurred earlier than January 10 th 2020, and most of the imported cases were imported to the Shaanxi Province before the implementation of the national travel restrictions on January 23 rd 2020. Therefore, the earlier the implementation of the travel restrictions, the greater the reduction of infected cases by COVID-19 in the Shaanxi province has. An intermittent population inflow with low proportion of imported cases may significantly mitigate the transmission risk. Thus, if the public health authorities can strictly monitor and reduce the number of imported cases, it would be possible for the Shaanxi province to return back and resume working continuously. It is very important to study the epidemic situation of COVID-19 by using traced data rather than simply using the number of confirmed cases, especially in the areas where the imported cases are the main and the epidemic situation is not serious. This can not only provide important data information for the accurate evaluation of the epidemic situation in other areas outside Hubei Province, but also provide important and accurate data support for the evaluation of the effectiveness and timeliness of public health intervention strategies in different areas. We proposed a stochastic model which can provide an important model framework and methodology for the evaluation of imported cases on local epidemic in the Shaanxi province (and can eventually be adapted for other similar provinces of China). Data analysis reveals that strengthening the public health interventions, tracing imported cases and improving the confirmation rate are effective and timely after January 23 rd 2020. According to the traced data shown in Figure 1 , the first imported cases in Shaanxi Province were earlier than January 10, and most of the imported cases were imported to Shaanxi Province before the national travel restrictions were implemented on January 23nd, as shown in Figure 2 . Therefore, the earlier implementation of travel restriction will greatly reduce the epidemic situation of COVID-19 in Shaanxi province, which was not serious. The findings suggest that keeping an intermittent population inflow with a low proportion of imported cases may induce a small second outbreak and hence decrease the transmission risk. Thus, if we can strictly monitor and reduce the number of imported cases, it is possible for Shaanxi to resume work continuously, especially intermittently. the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

71472,"Since COVID-19 emerged in early December, 2019 in Wuhan and swept across China Mainland, a series of large-scale public health interventions, especially Wuhan lock-down combined with nationwide traffic restrictions and Stay At Home Movement, have been taken by the government to control the epidemic. Based on Baidu Migration data and the confirmed cases data, we identified two key factors affecting the later (e.g February 27, 2020) cumulative confirmed cases in non-Wuhan region (y). One is the sum travelers from Wuhan during January 20 to January 26 (x1), which had higher infected probability but lower transmission ability because the human-to-human transmission risk of COVID-19 was confirmed and announced on January 20. The other is the seed cases from Wuhan before January 19, which had higher transmission ability and could be represented with the confirmed cases before January 29 (x2) due to a mean 10-day delay between infection and detection. A simple yet effective regression model then was established as follow: y= 70.0916+0.0054*x1+2.3455*x2 (n = 44, R2 = 0.9330, P<10-7). Even the lock-down date only delay or in advance 3 days, the estimated confirmed cases by February 27 in non-Wuhan region will increase 35.21% or reduce 30.74% - 48.59%.

71523,"We found similar estimates of reproducibility number and the proportion of the Spanish population contaminated by the new coronavirus, whether they were estimated from hospitalization numbers or detected cases. Both estimates from case reports and hospitalizations suggest that only mandatory quarantine achieved R0 lower than 1, while R0 during state of emergency before non-essential services were shut down was estimated to be well beyond 1. This predicts that the opening of the non-essential services by April 13 may lead to a new surge of cases. Based on this empirical study, mandatory confinement is the only measure that effectively reduces the number of contaminations.   ()   .   Estimated based on death reports differed considerably from those based on either hospitalizations or detected cases. This suggests that some of the assumptions and data our modeling is based on may not be accurate (although commonly used in previous studies), and shows that this can induce very large biases in the estimation of the propagation of the new coronavirus in Spain. Since hospitalizations reports are believed to be more reliable than either reported cases or deaths reports, we further comment on the results obtained with these reports. Our approach is very similar to a study by an Imperial College team published last week Other studies have also estimated the number of cases from the reported deaths, assuming a fixed duration from infection to death. 2 2    ()  . This could be due to a series of factors. First, the communities with largest proportion of cases could start developing herd immunity, hence limiting the propagation of the infection (which seems unlikely given that in the most affected CCAA, only a few percent have been infected according to our estimations). It could also be the result of local policies taken before the national lockdown in the most affected CCAA, or a better compliance of lockdown and social distancing in most affected areas. Another factor could be the migration from the most affected (especially Madrid) to less affected region before lockdown was implemented, 3 or some distortions in the reporting (underreporting) of cases in saturated health systems. 3 see    ()  Our study has several important limitations. First, as noted previously, it is not clear how reliable is the data the modeling is based on: both epidemiological reports, and infectious estimate probability and latency of symptoms, case detection, hospitalization and death). It should be stressed that the unreliability of epidemiologic data (with changes of criterion of inclusion along time and between CCAA) induces important biases which impedes an accurate estimation of the impact of political measures on the propagation of the new coronavirus. A faster and more reliable tracking of the epidemics could be performed if cases were reported in a systematic way dated by the onset of symptoms rather than detection, as the incubation period has been well characterized. Second, the model captures the number of new cases each day as a proportion from the pool of infected people in the same area. It does not take into account how the age distribution in each area affects that each infection leads to hospitalizations or death, nor how the probability of infecting depends on the days from infection as in (Flaxman et al. 2020 ). Nor do it take into account mobility between regions, whose impact is believed to be more important at the initiation of the epidemics. It is also worth noting that in locked down environment where most contacts are compartmentalized in households, it is possible that at beginning the virus continues to spread rapidly within households, but less so between households. As immunity was not taken care here, 0 may decrease significantly more without further policies, after this first wave of within-household contamination is over. Finally, we only modeled impact of lockdown, not of other measures which were taken too close apart (banning public events, closing schools, etc.), and simultaneously in most regions, so it is not possible here to disentangle their effects precisely. In conclusion, the greatest interest should be focused on the trends in R0 found in this work, while concrete numerical predictions should be taken with extreme caution, as there is a lack of reliable epidemiological data we can base the models on.   ()   .   ","We found similar estimates of reproducibility number and the proportion of the Spanish population contaminated by the new coronavirus, whether they were estimated from hospitalization numbers or detected cases.<q>Both estimates from case reports and hospitalizations suggest that only mandatory quarantine achieved R0 lower than 1, while R0 during state of emergency before non-essential services were shut down was estimated to be well beyond 1.<q>This predicts that the opening of the non-essential services by April 13 may lead to a new surge of cases.

71524,"We evaluated the number of COVID-19 patient encounters, PPE use, consequent exposures due to inadequate PPE, resulting quarantine, and positive COVID-19 tests among EMS providers. In this population-based observational investigation of 274 EMS encounters for patients with COVID-19 involving nearly 1,000 EMS provider-encounters, three EMS providers subsequently tested positive for COVID-19 during the 14 days following the patient encounter. Iterative dispatch and operational EMS responses to COVID-19 risk identification and PPE use were associated with both a temporal decrease in EMS provider COVID-19 exposure and conservation of PPE. Based on these programmatic efforts, full MEGG PPE was deployed in about one-third of all potential EMS provider uses by the end of the study period. Although healthcare workers (HCW) seem to be at higher risk to contract COVID-19, rigorous assessment of exposure and transmission is largely lacking. Epidemiological reports from China and Italy highlight the substantial burden of illness in HCWs. [9] [10] [11] Locally, in Washington State, a large portion of LTCF staff tested positive for COVID-19. 3 A preliminary report from CDC regarding the burden of COVID-19 infection among US healthcare personnel suggest HCWs account for 11-19% of national case burden, but did not discern specific type of employment or evaluate the potential source of exposure. 12 Other reports involving high-risk circumstances involving aerosolizing procedures however have not observed substantial rates of transmission to HCWs. 13 Similar to our findings, a Taiwanese study reported a secondary attack rate of 0.9% among the subset of COVID-19 exposures occurring in the healthcare setting. 14 None of these experiences have reported risk to EMS providers, though EMS care appears to be integral for sicker COVID-19 patients. In the 2009 SARS outbreak, the overall incidence of infection was 1.3% in the Taiwanese EMS workforce, which was >100-fold higher than the general public. 15 In the current investigation, EMS had substantial involvement with COVID-19 illness. The 220 patients represented 14% of all COVID-19 diagnoses in King County, WA through March 26. EMS was typically involved in care for older adults who often presented with heterogeneous symptoms and a range of clinical presentations. COVID-19 in King County was first detected in a clinical population not considered high-risk according to national guidelines at that time, which accounted in part for the fact that 18% of EMS providers in the study had an exposure. Indeed, 85.4% of patients had not been diagnosed with COVID-19 at the time of their EMS encounter. The high rate of quarantine early on motivated the EMS system to move quickly to adapt to the evolving clinical features and local epidemiology of the COVID-19 outbreak. EMS leadership engaged dispatch and operations to expand COVID-19 risk criteria and to stage patient assessment. The set of measures was associated with a marked reduction in the risk of exposure over the course of investigation. Certainly, there was a learning curve that may have also contributed to reduction in exposure. The collective effect appears to be a temporal reduction in EMS worker quarantine, even though the number of provider encounters with COVID-19 increased over time (Figure 2 ).   ()   . We observed that three of the 700 EMS providers (0.4%) with COVID-19 encounters subsequently tested positive for COVID-19. One case occurred at the outset of the outbreak with onset of provider illness occurring on the same date of COVID-19 encounter. The CDC investigated this case and determined that the 9-1-1 incident that qualified the provider for study inclusion was not responsible for disease transmission. Nonetheless, the provider may have had a patient exposure in the days prior to identification of COVID-19 cases in King County, as further review confirmed care for patients with acute respiratory illness. The providers in all three cases had MEGG PPE during their qualifying encounters. We cannot determine whether transmission occurred during these patient-specific exposures, other occupational activities, or community transmission. Overall, the cumulative lab-confirmed prevalence in this EMS cohort of 700 unique providers (0.4%) is comparable to the community prevalence (0.2%) during this time frame. 1 Taken together, these findings suggest that occupational risk can be relatively low and that protective measures can potentially limit disease transmission. The anecdotal experiences in other regions reporting high rates of COVID-19 among EMS providers may be related to the higher prevalence of disease paired with limited availability and use of PPE. There is an inherent tension between proactive measures to don adequate PPE and conservation efforts due to limited supplies. If PPE were limitless, then indiscriminate use by all providers for every call would help assure EMS provider protection. However, our system had limited supply that was coupled with uncertainty about the severity and duration of the pandemic. Thus, the EMS system strived to target the use of PPE to risk positive patients. The scout strategy for stable patients enabled more deliberate decisions regarding PPE. In contrast, time-critical events such as cardiac arrest required comprehensive EMS PPE given the need for care prior to evaluating COVID-19 risk. The current targeted strategies for MEGG utilization appear to be a viable means to protect EMS providers and conserve PPE. The retrospective methodology used to assess PPE is imperfect, relying on documentation and case-specific investigation; the two-stage process however enabled detailed provider interviews to assess potential exposure. Provider documentation may introduce bias, although providers were motivated to accurately document PPE. Providers received training and education on bestpractices of donning and doffing of PPE, but there was not a dedicated observer to document the quality of the process. The study could not report on the temporal use of PPE across the system, but rather the status after implementation of various interventions designed to better assess COVID-19 risk and responsibly use PPE. Documentation of quarantine evolved during the study period to use a central monitoring database. Thus, quarantine decisions early in the outbreak may be an underestimate of quarantine. We relied on the statewide Washington Disease Reporting System database to identify COVID-19 positive patients. There likely were patients ill with COVID-19 who interfaced with EMS but were not tested. Alternatively, EMS encounters with COVID-19 positive patients may exist that were not captured due to failed linking of identifiers between EMS and surveillance databases. The study relied on EMS agency health officers and the Washington Disease Reporting System database to identify EMS providers tested for COVID-19. Although unlikely, this dual approach may have missed a lab-confirmed infection in an EMS provider. EMS providers may also have   ()   . chosen not to get tested or had asymptomatic infection, though symptomatic providers were motivated to be tested and had prioritized access to testing. We cannot confirm the source of the infectious exposure-patient-specific, other occupational, or community transmission-among the few providers with positive tests. In conclusion, less than 0.5% of EMS providers experienced COVID-19 illness within 14 days of caring for a patient with lab-confirmed COVID-19. Programmatic risk mitigation strategies were associated with a reduction in occupational exposures to COVID-19 among EMS providers, while achieving a measured use of PPE. ()    ()   .   ()   .

71564,"The primary aim of this work was to understand why different regions of the world experience the pandemic spread of CoVID-19 in different ways. By recurrent testing of the population, infected individuals can be identified and quarantined, effectively preventing them from spreading the disease any further. It was observed that through increased rates of testing, an increasing percentage of the population could be saved from experiencing CoVID-19 altogether, to a point where if 40% of the population could be tested daily, any disease having a similar reproduction number would not be able to spread at all. This suggests an opportunity for preventing future viral outbreaks if testing can become a routine procedure that responsible members of the population carry out on themselves and self-report. It was also observed that through increased rates of testing, the peak of confirmed cases could be lowered, relieving the toll of an epidemic on the supply chain, and indirectly human wellbeing. It was observed that by de-densification of the susceptible population, the peak count of active confirmed infected cases could be reduced and also delayed, to where the rate of infection of the population was decreased, potentially allowing .

This observation can be an opportunity for actionable advice for urban areas with flexible population densities, such as those with large student populations. By analyzing how Hubei, China, South Korea, Spain, and Iran have experienced the pandemic spread of CoVID-19, it was observed that countries like South Korea, despite having highly dense susceptible populations, can curb the transmission of the disease in the population by high rates of testing. Along similar lines, it was observed that despite having a less dense population, if recurrent testing rates are low, the potential for an unmitigated outbreak is high as is the case in Iran. Rather than seek to prescribe a confident policy recommendation or forecast future spreading of the pandemic based on the limited amount of data available currently, this work aims to offer a model for estimating the current spread of CoVID-19 based on demographic information and chosen policies, and present a tool for visualizing the effect that adjusting the variables of population density and testing rate has on a simulated population in a theoretical system.

71582,"As of April 15th, we have sequenced and assembled a total of 79 nearly complete SARS-CoV-2 genomes obtained from patients across Arizona. These genomes were sequenced from nasopharyngeal swabs that were collected over a 28 day period from March 5th to April 2nd, 2020. This represents a sequencing effort of 4.9% of all reported cases in Arizona as of April 2nd. This dataset includes at least one genome from 11 of the 15 Arizona counties (Supplementary Table 3) . Aside from AZ1, 3 SARS-CoV-2 genomes from Arizona were sequenced by the CDC, which we do not include in any analyses. Initial Arizona case did not lead to sustained local transmission The first case of COVID-19 in Arizona (AZ1) was documented in late January 2020, and contact tracing suggested this initial case did not result in additional symptomatic infections within the state 5 . We sought to independently verify this conclusion using Bayesian and maximum likelihood phylogenetic analyses to compare our 79 genomes to a representative subset of the SARS-CoV-2 genomes generated from around the world. The genomes used in this analysis were selected using a novel bioinformatics pipeline (see Methods), which subsampled genomes uploaded to GISAID to reduce the size of the dataset while representing temporal, spatial, and genetic diversity of the full dataset. This resulted in a set of 384 SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences, including our 79 Arizona genomes and 305 additional representatives (Supplementary Table 1) . A reduced version of this dataset, including 372 genomes with complete dating information, was used in the Bayesian analysis. Our phylogenetic analyses ( Figure 1 and Supplementary Figure 1 ) indicated that the genome from AZ1 belonged to lineage A. Although 9/79 (11.4%) of our genomes also clustered in lineage A, these genomes belonged to distinct sublineages (A.1, A.2 and A.3), and the AZ1 genome contained one derived substitution (C-to-T at nucleotide position 29,031) that we did not observe in any other Arizona sequences. This substitution was, however, shared with 12 other genomes included in our analysis, all of which were sampled in China or Japan. This is consistent with infection of AZ1 occurring during documented travel to China 5 . Although our analyses cannot completely rule out the possibility of a cryptic transmission chain originating from this initial case, it is clear that the first documented introduction of SARS-CoV-2 to Arizona did not play a substantial role in fueling the ongoing epidemic. Rather, the majority of Arizona cases are linked to later introduction events (see below). These results further demonstrate the power of public health contact tracing and self-isolation following a positive test for stemming the tide of infections moving forward. Based on our phylogenetic analysis, it is clear that the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak in Arizona has been fueled by multiple distinct introductions of SARS-CoV-2 to the state. We estimate a minimum of 9 over the course of February and March. By estimating the timing of introductions, we find no evidence for cryptic community transmission in Arizona prior to late January. Rather, our analyses indicate that community transmission likely did not occur within Arizona until at least early-to mid-February when viruses from lineages B.1 and A.1 may have been introduced. It appears that most of the introductions of SARS-CoV-2 to Arizona have had domestic origins, in line with reports from other states 16 ; however, there have also been instances of Arizona cases linked to international travel, and these have likely also contributed to the local outbreak. A number of non-synonymous mutations were identified in the Arizona isolates, including within regions of the receptor-binding domain of the spike protein and non-structural proteins involved in the RNA synthesis complex. The functional consequences of these mutations are unknown, highlighting the need for mechanistic studies. Our phylodynamic tracing provides unique epidemiological insights into the origins and transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in Arizona.

71592,"The social network model provides a conceptual framework to analyze the COVID-19 pandemic on the level of individuals, that can be used to predict the influence of collective social behavior on overall pandemic trajectories. It shows the importance of social distancing, and the message that to contain the epidemic, every member of the public plays a crucial part in breaking the chain of transmission. Given the current understanding of COVID-19 viral epidemiology, the epidemic in the U.S. can be controlled by limiting the average number of contacts per person to 7 unique individuals over each 5 day period. For an average American family, the 7 contacts might be a spouse, two children, a friend, a neighbor, a colleague, and a cashier during grocery shopping. The time from the beginning of collective social action to the inflection point of the epidemic is about 3 viral generation intervals, totaling 2-3 weeks. Once daily new cases are decreasing, social distancing measures can be gradually relaxed, in phases, to prevent rebound of viral transmission. After social distancing becomes widely implemented and most people stay at home, the majority of new cases is expected to be from household transmission. One way to further reduce the epidemic is to bring all patients with confirmed COVID-19 to medical facilities to prevent the spread of infection at home, as was the practice in China, where moderate to severe cases were hospitalized while mild cases were kept in isolation centers until they were no longer infectious on viral nucleic acid testing. This is also the standard of care for other communicable diseases such as tuberculosis, where clinically stable patients are discharged home after three negative induced sputum samples. Finally, the social network model of COVID-19 transmission is expandable and extendable. This paper provides a simplified version using population averages for parameters. Researchers who have access to patient-level data can substitute these average values by their respective probability distributions to simulate stochastic viral transmission. .

71601,"Understanding the impact of mobility on the early stages of spreading of a epidemic is key to design efficient public health responses. In this work, we address the question of how relevant is multi-seeding for the epidemic indicators in a population. The relation between a larger inflow of seeds and the epidemic size, heights of the incidence and mortality peaks is easy to hypothesize from a theoretical perspective. Is it, however, a reality? To test it, we perform a simple correlation analysis in the context of the present COVID-19 pandemic in Spain. The first local outbreak was declared in Madrid, attaining 100 a b FIG. 6. Statistical models. Comparison plots for the height of the a incidence and b mortality peaks.

From then on, cases were detected in all the 52 provinces and autonomous cities of the country. The confinement measures were taken in an uniform way across the country with a first lockdown on Friday March 14, 2020, a more strict lockdown on March 29. The incidence peaks for most of the provinces occurred after the first lockdown and before the second. The fact that the lockdowns are uniform allows us to perform the analysis on multi-seeding in equal conditions. We find a clear relation between the mobility from/to Madrid and the heights of the peaks of incidence and mortality. Furthermore, the kind of mobility that better correlates is the one exhibited by weekenders one week before the local onset and, typically, before the confinement measures. This supports the policies intended to target non-essential trips first and, only later, commuting flows (weekday travelers). It is not surprising that a larger mobility to and from the area with the first outbreak accelerates the local onsets. But if the flow of trips per capita are high and frequent, the probability of importing more cases increases. Multi-seeds impact in different zones of the local social/contact network. The protection that bottlenecks .

The main contribution of our work is to offer empirical evidence of such connections between multi-seeding and the severity of the epidemic at the population level. We hope that this study will highlight the importance of mobility in an epidemic situation, which goes beyond a first direct relation between arrival times and inflow of trips, and help stakeholders and decisionmakers to design more efficient responses.

71637,"This is the first study to demonstrate the effects of transportation restriction measures together with the improvement of diagnostic capacity on the transmission dynamics in Wuhan. We found that the proportion of the documented infections increased as the availability of test kits and the accuracy of diagnostic progressed by time. Our initial estimated proportion of documented infections was consistent with a recent study 16 . However, the estimated proportion increased up to around 73% after February 12. Also, our results showed that transportation restrictions in Wuhan successfully contained disease growth. These findings may provide some suggestions for further analyses. Unlike most studies with the proportion of documented infections being fixed over time, our estimated proportion was close to the prediction in the study of Ruiyun et al. (14%) 16 at the initial stage, but increased to around 70% by progress. Diagnostic capability strongly influenced the proportion of documented infections. During the early outbreak in Wuhan, a large proportion of cases were not able to be confirmed as the test kits were insufficient 16 . On January 26, the State Food and Drug Administration (SFDA) approved four new coronavirus detection kits from four companies 17 to increase the supply of detection kits, and our estimated proportion of documented infections increased to 37% after then. On February 12, the diagnostic criteria were enhanced by including clinically diagnosed cases 18 . The undocumented infections may be of mild illness and insufficiently serious about seeking treatment 16 . We found the estimated undocumented proportion of infections was less than 30% after February 12. This finding suggested that the proportion of mild symptomatic cases were likely to be around or less than 30%. Our estimation of R t during the curve up period aligns with other recent studies 24 (3.11 by Jonathan et al. 6 , 3.15 by Tian et al. 8 , 1.4 to 3.9 by Li et al. 1 ). Furthermore, our results showed both transportation restriction and quarantine measures were able to limit virus transmission. Transportation restrictions, including halting all forms of public transportation, trains, and air travel, sharply reduced social contacts and virus transmission rates. Concurrent with the implementation of transportation measures, personal awareness of the virus and protective behavior (e.g., wearing facemasks, washing hands frequently, social distancing) also increased. Although our study did not exclude the effects caused by changes in public response coming along with the transportation measures, we found R e dropped by 87% after the introduction of transportation restriction. These findings are in agreement with the results of Kucharski et al. 7 and Ruiyun et al. 16 . Besides, quarantine of the symptomatic infections was also essential in curbing the epidemic 25 . Under the actual condition in Wuhan (with quarantine), the estimated time from symptom to quarantine was around 5.65 days at the initial stage, possibly due to a lack of sufficient resources during this period. Our estimated incubation time was consistent with other recent studies 1 8 19 26 . Given the estimated incubation period as 5.57 days but the latent period as 2.92 days, there can be a lot of transmissions that occurred during the asymptomatic infectious period. How to reduce possible contact during the asymptomatic infectious period is one of the major tasks to contain the virus spread. Our results were in agreement with the advocation from the government that people who had close contact with confirmed cases need to be quarantined for at least 14 days 27 . Overall, our studies suggested an improved capability with intensive transportation control and quarantine measures, can be able to contain COVID outbreak in a city. .

71642,"Summary Background With confirmed cases of COVID-19 declining in many countries, lockdown measures are gradually being lifted. However, even if most social distancing measures are continued, other public health measures will be needed to control the epidemic. Contact tracing either via conventional methods or via mobile app technology is central to control strategies during de-escalation of social distancing. It is therefore essential to identify key factors for a contact tracing strategy (CTS) to be successful. Methods We evaluated the impact of timeliness and completeness in various steps of a CTS using a stochastic mathematical model with explicit time delays between time of infection, symptom onset, diagnosis by testing, and isolation. The model also includes tracing of close contacts (e.g. household members) and casual contacts with different delays and coverages. We computed effective reproduction numbers of a CTS (Rcts) for a population with social distancing measures and various scenarios for isolation of index cases and tracing and quarantine of its contacts. Findings In the best-case scenario (testing and tracing delays of 0 days and tracing coverage of 100%) the effective reproduction number will be reduced with 50% from 1.2 (with social distancing only) to 0.6 (Rcts) by contact tracing. A testing delay of 3 days requires tracing delay or coverage to be at most 1 day or at least 80% to keep Rcts below 1, with the Rcts reduction being 15% and 17%, respectively. With a testing delay of 4 days, even the most efficient CTS cannot reach Rcts values below 1. The effect of minimizing tracing delay (e.g., with app-based technology) declines with declining coverage of app use, but app-based tracing remains more effective than conventional contact tracing even with 20% coverage. The proportion of transmissions per index case that can be prevented depending on testing and tracing delay and isolation of index cases ranges from above 80% in the best-case scenario (testing and tracing delays of 0 days) to 40% and 17% with testing delays of 3 and 5 days, respectively. Interpretation Minimizing testing delay is of key importance for the effectiveness of CTS. Optimizing testing and tracing coverage and minimizing tracing delays, for instance with app-based technology further enhances effectiveness of CTS, with a potential to prevent up to 80% of all transmissions. The process of conventional contact tracing should be reviewed and streamlined, while mobile app technology may offer a tool for gaining speed in the process.","Summary Background With confirmed cases of COVID-19 declining in many countries, lockdown measures are gradually being lifted.<q>However, even if most social distancing measures are continued, other public health measures will be needed to control the epidemic.<q>Findings In the best-case scenario (testing and tracing delays of 0 days and tracing coverage of 100%) the effective reproduction number will be reduced with 50% from 1.

71698,"We introduce a deterministic model that partitions the total population into the susceptible, infected, quarantined, and those traced after exposure, recovered and the deceased. We introduce the concept of 'accessible population for transmission of the disease', which can be a small fraction of the total population, for instance when interventions are in force. This assumption, together with the structure of the set of coupled nonlinear ordinary differential equations for the populations, allows us to decouple the equations into just two equations. This further reduces to a logistic type of equation for the total infected population. The equation can be solved analytically and therefore allows for a clear interpretation of the growth and inhibiting factors in terms of the parameters in the full model. The validity of the 'accessible population' assumption and the efficacy of the reduced logistic model is demonstrated by the ease of fitting the United Kingdom data for the total number of infected cases. The model can also be used to forecast further progression of the disease. The approach further helps us to analyze the original model equations. We show that the original model equations provide a very good fit with the United Kingdom data for the cumulative number of infections. The active infected population of the model is seen to exhibit a turning point around mid-May, suggesting the beginning of a slow-down in the spread of infections. However, the rate of slowing down beyond the turning point is small and therefore the cumulative number of infections is likely to saturate to about 3.8 x 105 only towards the end of July or beginning of August, provided the lock-down conditions continue to prevail. Noting that the fits obtained from the reduced logistic equation and the full model equations are equally good, the underlying causes for the limited forecasting ability of the reduced logistic equation is elucidated. The model and the procedure adopted here are expected to be useful in fitting the data for other countries and forecasting the progression of the disease.","We introduce a deterministic model that partitions the total population into the susceptible, infected, quarantined, and those traced after exposure, recovered and the deceased.<q>We introduce the concept of 'accessible population for transmission of the disease', which can be a small fraction of the total population, for instance when interventions are in force.<q>The equation can be solved analytically and therefore allows for a clear interpretation of the growth and inhibiting factors in terms of the parameters in the full model.

Our findings suggested that the COVID-19 has an 228 incubation time of more than five days (5.84 days) and a lag of less than five days (4.82 days) 229 from onset of symptoms to first clinical visit. On average, the symptoms lasted more than 230 twenty days (17.76 days) before recovery was achieved and the mortality risk among 231 confirmed cases was 2%, which significantly increased by age.

71832,"Timely diagnosis and triaging of PUIs are crucial for the control of emerging infectious diseases such as the current COVID-19. Due to the limitation of nucleic acid -based laboratory testing, there is an urgent need to look for fast alternative methods that can be used by front-line health care personal for quickly and accurately diagnosing the disease. In the present study, we have developed an AI program by analyzing representative CT images using a deep learning method. This is a retrospective, multicohort, diagnostic study. We constructed an Inception migration neuro network that achieved 82.9% accuracy. Moreover, the high performance of the deep learning model we developed in this study was tested using external samples with 73% accuracy. These findings have demonstrated the proof of principle that deep learning can extract CT image features of COVID-19 for diagnostic purposes. Further developing this system can significantly shorten the diagnosis time for disease control. In addition, it can reduce the diagnostic workload of physicians in the field. Our study represents the first study to apply artificial intelligence technologies to CT images for effectively screening for COVID-19.

Recent data have suggested that the accuracy of nucleic acid testing is only about 30-50%. Using CT imaging feature extraction, we are able to achieve above 83% accuracy, significantly outplaying nucleic acid testing. In addition, this method is non-invasive with minimal cost. Although we are satisfied with the initial results, we believe that with more CT images included in the training, we will achieve higher accuracy. Therefore, further optimizing and testing this system is warranted. To achieve this, we have generated a webpage that licensed healthcare personnel can access to upload CT images for testing. The webpage information is as following: . There are some limitations to our study. CT images present a difficult classification task due to the relatively large number of variable objects, specifically the imaged areas outside the lungs that are irrelevant to the diagnosis of pneumonia [11] . In our study, only one radiologist was involved in outlining the ROI area. In addition, the training data set is relatively small. The performance of this system is expected to increase when the training volume is increased.

71936,"The number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the Rio de Janeiro state, Brazil, are still growing. Based on the data, we considered a SIQR on a fully-connected population in order to study the early evolution of the disease. The initial growth of confirmed cases is exponential, as it is usual, and the parameters of such early epidemic phase were estimated, based on the data. However, as discussed in the text, the Rio de Janeiro state governement implemented isolation policies in March 17, in order to avoid the explosion of cases of COVID-19. The data after the early evolution of COVID-19 exhibits a distinct, nonexponential behavior, i.e., the growth of the number of cases becomes sub-exponential, and the SIQR model can not capture such behavior. In this case, we modified the model to consider isolation procedures in a simple way. The modified model describes well the data, and it allowed us to make a detailed analysis of the evolution of COVID-19 in Rio de Janeiro. Considering the data, we have observed that the initial exponential behavior changed to the sub-exponential one about 7 days after the implementation of social distancing policies (see Fig. 3 ). We found that the isolation policies really work, i.e., the fact of isolate people in home, to avoid social contacts, decreased the growth rate of the number of cases. For the considered parameters, we observed that the number of quarantined individuals grows, stabilizes and after it decays to zero, as it is standard in compartmental models. Based on the data, we can see that the number of such isolated individuals grows until Day 99 from the beginning (March 5, 2020) of the disesase spreading. Thus, the model predicts that the maximum number of quarantined individuals will occur about June 11, 2020. This is in line with a recent estimate [14] . That peak is associated with the isolation of about 0.041% of the Rio de Janeiro state population (about 6, 700 individuals). This number is about 500 times lower than the one predicted by the SIQR model without isolation policies, suggesting the effectiveness of the social isolation. In fact, combining quarantine of individuals tested positive (confirmed cases) with social distance, i.e., multiple interventions, appears to be effective to contain the rapid evolution of confirmed cases seen in the early evolution of the COVID-19 in Rio de Janeiro state. This is in line with a recent work [14] , where the authors analyzed the potential role of nonpharmaceutical interventions in UK and USA. They conclude that the effectiveness of any one intervention in isolation is likely to be .

71942,"The world is currently experiencing a devastating pandemic of a novel Coronavirus (caused by SARS-CoV2) that emerged in Wuhan city of China in December of 2019. The deadly COVID-19 pandemic has spread to over 210 countries, causing over 1.9 million cases and 125,000 deaths worldwide (with some parts of Asia, Europe and, now, the US suffering the brunt of the burden). There is currently no safe and effective vaccine for use in humans against COVID-19. There is also no safe and effective antiviral. Consequently, control and mitigation efforts against COVID-19 are limited to non-pharmaceutical interventions, such as social-distancing (which involves keeping a physical distance of at least 6 feet from other humans in public, lockdowns of communities, closure of schools, malls, places of worships and other gathering places), quarantine of suspected cases, contact-tracing, isolation (at home or in hospital) of confirmed cases and the use of face masks (both low quality cloth masks and the higher quality surgical masks) in public. This study is based on the design, analysis and simulations of a new mathematical model for providing deeper insights into the transmission dynamics and control of COVID-19 in a community. Specifically, the model designed in this study was parametrized using COVID-19 data from the US state of New York and the entire US population. The model was used to assess the population-impact of the aforementioned control and mitigation interventions. The model was rigorously analysed to gain insight into its dynamical features. It was shown that the diseasefree equilibrium of the model is locally-asymptotically stable when a certain epidemiological threshold, known as the reproduction number (and denoted by R c ) is less than unity. The epidemiological implication of this result is that a small influx of COVID-19 cases will not generate a large outbreak in the community if R c is less than unity (and the disease can be effectively controlled in this case). For such effective control (or elimination) of the disease to be independent of the initial sizes of the infected population, a global asymptotic stability must be established for the disease-free equilibrium. This was done for the special case of the model where quarantine is perfect (i.e., the special case of the model where quarantined-susceptible individuals do not acquire infection during quarantine). The implication of this theoretical result is that, for the case where quarantine of susceptible individuals is perfectly implemented in the community, the aforementioned control and mitigation strategies can lead to the elimination of the COVID-19 pandemic if their effectiveness levels (measured in terms of their efficacy and coverage) are high enough to bring (and maintain) the associated reproduction number of the model to a value less than unity. The epidemiological meaning of elimination is the cessation of community transmission. Our study shows that COVID-19 elimination in the state of New York and the entire US is feasible using the basic non-pharmaceutical 20 . CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0   author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity. is the (which was not peer-reviewed)  interventions discussed in this study (notably social-distancing, use of face-masks in public and contact-tracing and quarantine) if implemented at the required level of effectiveness and compliance/adherence. Thus, this study shows that COVID-19 elimination can be considered a realistic goal in the US. If achieved, sustaining such elimination would require taking further measures to minimize the possibility of a rebound, such as more consistent surveillance for COVID-19, the potential use of a vaccine and expanded testing. We parameterized the model using COVID-19 data from New York state and the entire US, and extensive numerical simulations were carried out using the parametrized model to assess the population-level impact of the various intervention strategies. With the baseline levels of the four main intervention strategies considered (socialdistancing, quarantine/isolation, contact-tracing and the use of face-masks), the state of New York is projected to see a peak of the pandemic around mid April, 2020 (with 66, 300 number of hospitalizations/isolation of confirmed cases and 105, 100 deaths at the peak), while the entire US will see its peak around end of April, 2020 (with 115, 000 hospitalizations/isolation of confirmed cases and 164, 000 deaths at the peak). Our projections for baseline (worst-case) mortality for the US are much lower than the 2.2 million deaths suggested by Ferguson et al. in the absence of interventions [34] , but fall within the range estimated in [56] . Our projected numbers for COVID-19 burden (morbidity and mortality) dramatically decreases if strict social-distancing measures are implemented at high adherence levels. For instance, it was shown that strict compliance to the statewide lock-down in New York state (which corresponds to reducing the baseline contact rate in our model by at least 40%) will reduce the peak values for hospitalizations/isolation of confirmed cases and mortality to 5, 000 and 20, 700, respectively. Similarly, the peak values for cases and mortality in the entire US (if a nation-wide lockdown capable of reducing baseline contact rate by at least 40%) will decrease to 14, 000 and 59, 600, respectively. The duration and timing of the termination of strict social-distancing measures are critically-important in the battle to effectively combat pandemics of respiratory diseases, such as the devastating COVID-19 pandemic. While the rapid implementation of strict social-distancing measures (during the early stage of the pandemic), maintained over a relatively long period of time (e.g., until the summer), will undoubtedly effectively combat the burden of the pandemic. Early termination of these measures will cause catastrophic outcomes. For instance, our study shows that relaxing or terminating the strict social-distancing measures in the state of New York and the US as a whole by end of April 2020 will trigger a devastating second wave, generating COVID-19 burden similar to those obtained during the pre-strict-social-distancing time in the state and in the entire nation by the end of July 2020 (with cumulative mortality numbers in the range reported in [56] for both New York state and the entire US). In particular, up to 144, 000 and 156, 000 cumulative deaths will have been recorded in the state of New York and the entire US if the social-distancing measures are shut down by the end of April, 2020. Extending the termination of social-distancing, such as to end of June 2020, significantly reduces the likelihood of a second wave (in addition to significantly reducing the associated burden of the pandemic). Consequently, a great deal of caution must be exercised before decisions are made to relax or terminate the existing highly-successful social-distancing protocols in both the state of New York and the entire US. It is noteworthy that countries that have recently relaxed these measures, such as Taiwan, Hong Kong and South Korea, have already started seeing a rebound of COVID-19. Our study suggests that the decision to relax or terminate the social-distancing measures should by on a case-bycase (i.e., state-by-state or county-by-county) basis, and should be informed by updated COVID-19 incidence and mortality data, number of COVID-19 tests (both antibody and surveillance tests) and proximity of a locality to COVID-19 hot spots. In particular, our study shows that strict social-distancing should be maintained until the year 2021 (up to late September 2021 for New York state, and early March, 2021 for the entire US) to eliminate COVID-19. Quarantine of people suspected of being exposed to a respiratory disease is perhaps the oldest public health control measure in human history. Our study shows that widescale implementation of quarantine intervention may not be very effective (in minimizing the burden of COVID-19) if the strategy of isolating confirmed cases is effective. In other words, our study suggests that if isolation can be implemented effectively (high efficacy and coverage), then quarantine of people suspected of contracting COVID-19 may not be necessary. This result is consistent with what was reported by Day et al. [62] . Tracing the contacts of confirmed cases (known as contacttracing) was also shown to only be marginally-effective in minimizing the burden of the pandemic. In particular, even if contact-tracing is implemented at the highest possible level (represented in our study based on increases in the contact-tracing parameters by 75%), the decrease in the burden of the pandemic recorded was only marginal (13% and 10% for cases in New York state and nationwide, respectively, and 5% and 3% for mortality for New York state and nationwide, respectively). The use of face-masks in public in times of outbreaks of respiratory diseases has a rich history. Although quite popular in some parts of the world (notably Asia), the use of face-masks in public is somewhat controversial. This was more evident in the US during the COVID-19, leading, ultimately, to the recommendation to use face-masks (home-made cloths masks) in public by the The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) on April 2, 2020. Our study shows that the use of high efficacy masks (such as surgical masks, with estimated efficacy of at least 70%) will lead to a dramatic reduction of COVID-19 burden if its coverage is high enough (at least 70%). In fact, our study shows that even face-masks of low efficacy (home-made cloths masks) will lead to a dramatic reduction of disease burden (albeit this will not lead to the elimination of the disease). For example, even face-mask efficacy of 25% can lead to a 63% and 64% reduction in the number of hospitalizations/isolation of confirmed cases at the pandemic peak in New York state and nationwide if 75% of the population wear face-masks in public. These results are consistent with those reported by Eikenberry et al. [45] . Furthermore, by generating contour plots for the control reproduction number of the model (2.1) (R c ), as a function of mask efficiency ( M ) and coverage (c M ), our study shows that the use of high efficacy masks (such as surgical masks, with estimated efficacy of ≥ 75%) will, indeed, lead to the elimination of COVID-19 (in both the state of New York and in the entire US nation) if the coverage is high enough (about 80%). This study shows that the use of face-masks in public is always useful, and their population-level impact increases will increases efficacy and coverage. In particular, even the use of low efficacy masks will greatly reduce the burden of the pandemic if the coverage in their usage in the community is high enough. Furthermore, our study shows that combining the masks-based strategy with the strict social-distancing strategy is more effective than the singular implementation of either strategy. For instance, our study shows that COVID-19 can be eliminated from the state of New York if the strict social-distancing measures implemented are combined with a face-masks strategy, using a moderately-effective mask (with efficacy of about 50%) if only 30% of the residents of the state wear the masks. The masks use compliance needed to eliminate the disease nationwide, under this scenario with strict social-distancing nationwide, is a mere 10%. In summary, our study suggests that, like in the case of the other Coronaviruses we have seen in the past (namely SARS and MERS [10] ), COVID-19 is a disease that appears to be controllable using basic non-pharmaceutical interventions, particularly social-distancing and the use of face-masks in public (especially when implemented in combinations). The factors that are obviously critically-important to the success of the anti-COVID-19 control efforts are the early implementation (and enhancement of effectiveness) of these intervention measures, and ensuring their high adherence/coverage in the community. .

71943,"Our analysis reported a much higher growth rate of the early 2019-nCoV outbreak in Wuhan. A direct comparison can be drawn with a previous analysis that also used internationally confirmed cases to infer the epidemic size and growth in Wuhan . However, their estimated doubling time is 6.4 days (95% CrI, 5.8 days -7.1 days). Another report (Li et al., 2020) using the cases in Wuhan estimated the doubling time to be 7.4 days (4.2 days -14 days). These estimates did not fit our simulated distribution of infections well, even with our impossibly extreme assumption of the travel rate (Figure 2, Panel D) . This shows that the epidemic may have been spreading much faster in Wuhan than these earlier estimates. There are several possible explanations for the large difference in epidemiological estimates. One possible reason is the different study sample. The previous reports used internationally confirmed cases as of January 28 and the first 425 confirmed cases in Wuhan. In comparison, we used confirmed cases in 6 selected countries and regions with detailed case reports as of February 4. Our selected countries and regions also have good public health surveillance systems and could more easily identified suspected cases in border control. Another key distinction is that our analysis used the simulated infection time instead of the noisier symptom onset as in the previous analyses. By using the cases' travel history (in particular, international arrival date), we can narrow down when the cases were infected. This reduces the noise in our estimates. A third distinction with the analysis by ) is that our model takes into account the restricted outbound travel from Wuhan since January 23, 2020 ---a milestone event in this epidemic. The analysis by used a more complicated susceptible-exposedinfectious-recovered (SEIR) model and only accounted for the quarantine of Wuhan in their forecast but not in their estimation. Ignoring the travel ban since January 23 could also produce much smaller growth rate in our model. However, we have convincingly demonstrated that this leads to very poor fit of the distribution of infection time. Our analysis should be viewed in terms of its limitations. The international cases are only ""shadows"" of the epidemic in Wuhan and we relied on the assumption that they form a representative sample. We used a simple exponential growth model for the new infections and did not account for the dynamics of the epidemics like a SEIR model. We assumed a constant .

In particular, millions of people (substantial proportion of the Wuhan population) traveled back home from Wuhan before the Lunar New Year, which we did not consider in our model. Finally, our estimates are relatively but not entirely insensitive to the incubation period which are crucial in simulating the infection time. Despite these potential limitations, we convincingly demonstrated that a simple theoretical model ---exponential growth with correction for the travel ban on January 23 ---provides very good fit to the internationally confirmed cases with detailed case trajectories. Our results suggest that the early outbreak of 2019-nCoV could have been spreading much faster in Wuhan than previous estimates. This has important implications in designing prevention measures to control the outbreak in other cities in China and around the world. On the more positive side, our simulated infection rates in January 21 to 23 showed visually significant departure from the previous growth pattern (Panel B, Figure 2 ). This gives some evidence that the prevention measures following the public confirmation of human-to-human transmission in the evening of January 20 were effective. ","Our analysis reported a much higher growth rate of the early 2019-nCoV outbreak in Wuhan.<q>A direct comparison can be drawn with a previous analysis that also used internationally confirmed cases to infer the epidemic size and growth in Wuhan .<q>4 days (4.2 days -14 days).

72009,"A total of 167 (32.7%) respondents in Wuhan and 102 (20.4%) respondents in Shanghai were identified to have moderate or severe anxiety (Panel A Table 2 ). The prevalence was significantly higher in Wuhan (p<0.001). The mean GAD-7 scores were 7.1 and 5.1 in Wuhan and Shanghai, respectively (p<0.001). In total 401 (78.6%) Wuhan participants and 320 (63.9%) Shanghai participants engaged in all six recommended and avoidance behaviors due to the novel coronavirus outbreak (Panel B Table 2 ). A high compliance rate of above 90% was observed in all other behaviors in both samples, except for increased surface cleaning, which was driving the significant observed differences in behavioral responses between the two cities (Table S1 ). Frequencies of washing hands immediately when returning home, wearing a face mask when going out, and duration of handwashing significantly increased in both cities during the outbreak (Panel B Table 2 ; Figure 2 ). We found no statistically significant differences in changes of the first two aforementioned behaviors. By contrast, more respondents reported longer duration of handwashing in Wuhan (p<0.001). Moreover, a significantly higher proportion of Wuhan respondents reported purchasing or trying to purchase goggles for prevention purpose (p=0.009). Overall, 12.7% Wuhan participants responded with correct perceived efficacy of behaviors. The proportion was significantly higher (p=0.004) in the Shanghai sample (19.4%) (Panel C Table 2 ). Generally, Wuhan respondents reported significantly higher self-perceived risk (p=0.033) of contracting novel coronavirus than their counterparts in Shanghai; however,   the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

No differences were found between the two cities in terms of perceived harm to body compared with SARS. Moreover, respondents aged 40 and above, who presumably have clearer memory of SARS, had higher (p<0.001) perceived relative severity than those aged 18-39 in Shanghai; similar findings were not found in Wuhan (Table S2) . Around 96.1% Wuhan respondents had received and read the information brochures of the novel coronavirus from the government or medical experts. The proportion was significantly lower (p<0.001) but still very high in Shanghai (89.0%). The majority of the respondents in both cities thought that the information that they received was sufficient, without discernable differences. By contrast, the Wuhan respondents were significantly more often confused about the reliability of the information that they received (p=0.003); only 31% respondents in Wuhan never felt bothered about this issue, while the corresponding figure in Shanghai was 42.9%. The majority of the participants agreed or strongly agreed with having confidence on taking measures to protect themselves. We detected no statistically significant differences across cities in this domain. We conducted a population-based telephone survey via random digital dialing to investigate anxiety levels, changes in precautionary behaviors and public perceptions among Wuhan and Shanghai residents during the early phase of 2019 novel coronavirus. Around of 32.7% Wuhan and 20.4% Shanghai participants reported moderate or severe anxiety; 78.6% Wuhan and 63.9% Shanghai respondents carried out all six precautionary behaviors due to the outbreak. Wuhan residents were significantly more responsive than their Shanghai counterparts in the two aforementioned outcomes. Our results suggested that perceived risk and severity of the disease as well as information reliability were important factors associated with the psychological and behavioral responses.

These polices are also responsible for the limited observed heterogeneity in uptake and changes of precautionary behaviors. For example, we find that no perception variables exerted a statistically meaningful effect on increased face mask wearing frequency (Table S3) . Third, we provided evidence for unwarranted precautionary behavior in coping with a novel disease, which was less documented in the literature. 5 Around 28% Wuhan and 21% Shanghai respondents reported having purchased or having tried to purchase goggles for infection prevention. According to the National Health Commission experts, goggles are unnecessary protective equipment for people other than medical staff on the front line of coronavirus outbreak. However, goggles were sold out nationwide shortly after a doctor wrote on social media and suspected that lack of eye protection in early investigation of the outbreak   the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

Our results showed that the irrational behavior was mainly driven by perceived higher severity than SARS and the over-reaction was more prevalent in Wuhan (Table S3) . Fourth, perceived susceptibility and severity of the coronavirus were higher compared with studies regarding other diseases. After translating our results into comparable scales, we found that the perceived chance of infection (12.5-18.6%) was higher than that during H7N9 in urban China (1.0-2.6%), 11 and SARS in Hong Kong (3.9-14.3%); 4 and the relative severity to SARS was four times higher than that of H7N9 in urban China (8.9-11.4%). 11 Though higher perceived risk and harm of coronavirus positively associated with favorable responses in behaviors, it also led to significantly higher anxiety levels among the general public. Our findings also yield several important public implications. First, providing the public with reliable and accurate information is crucial for addressing the psychological effects of contagious disease outbreaks. Public confusion about the reliability of information that they received might have led to significantly sustained anxiety. About 57.1-69.0% individuals were ever bothered by this issue, and the prevalence of this issue was significantly more common among people subject to quarantine in Wuhan, suggesting stronger desire for facts. 28 Second, consequences of misinformation could be long-lasting and should not be underestimated in health crisis management. 7, 29 Although efficacy of behaviors supported in advertising campaign was well received, rumors that have been proved wrong earlier during the SARS outbreak, for example, washing mouth with salty water, or having vitamin C or radix isatidis, still found their audience. Only 24.6-37.9% respondents in our study correctly considered these measures as ineffective (Table S4) ; the correct rate was significantly lower in Wuhan. Finally, awareness of hand hygiene in China has been low, which calls for more handwashing education in the community. We found that the proportion of handwashing duration over 40 seconds as recommended by WHO only slightly increased from 17.3% to 37.6% during novel coronavirus outbreak. 30 Fortunately, having received and read information brochures was positively associated with longer handwashing duration (Table S3) , suggesting education programs will be effective for addressing this issue.   the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is . . 18.20024448  Our study has a number of limitations. First, in order to investigate public response rates in the immediate aftermath of the major public health crisis, we shortened our survey questionnaire and chose to use random digital dialing with quota sampling to obtain demographically representative samples for both selected cities. We deliberately selected out times of handwashing as a key behavior measure, although it is widely discussed in the literature. Because people have largely reduced going out during the extended national holidays while embracing remote work, resulting in less times of handwashing than in usual days, which makes this measure less valid. Second, we asked respondents to recall some of their behaviors in usual days before December 2019. Their answers might suffer recall bias. In conclusion, it is seen that psychological and behavioral responses to COVID-19 had been dramatic during the rising phase of the outbreak. Prevalence of moderate or severe anxiety were 4-5 times of its normal level in urban China. The majority engaged in all six recommended and avoidance behaviors. Wuhan, the epicentre and quarantined city, was significantly more responsive in the aforementioned domains than Shanghai. Tremendous government efforts in control and prevention of the disease were associated with sizable changes in face mask wearing. However, confusion about information reliability significantly fueled the public anxiety levels, and public awareness of hand hygiene was less optimal. Our results support efforts for timely dissemination of accurate and reliable information and to focus more on handwashing education. the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

83237,"The COVID-19 pandemic brought to humankind many challenges, including the demand for new medical treatments, social policies and economical approaches. The fast response of the scientific community to deal with coronavirus was divided into studies of the epidemiological aspects, proposals of new treatments and diagnostic tools and new models to forecast the viral spreading, including SIR and SEIR models among others. Nonetheless, few studies focused on looking at the pandemics as a governmental policymaking problem. With this viewpoint, although the epidemiological aspects are priority, the social and economical aspects can not be neglected. The present work proposed an Agent-Based Model (ABM) that simulates the epidemiological and economical effects of COVID-19 pandemic in a closed society, whose results can be generalized for wider contexts and used by governmental rulers to prospect social policies and assess its potential effectiveness in real scenarios. The model was encapsulated in the free and open source software library COVID-ABS, which contains 29 epidemiological, social, demographic and economic input parameters, and 10 output response variables. New features can be designed and the library can be easily extended to other scenarios. In a wider perspective, the proposed approach can be used as a decisionsupport system for the governments and scientific community. Policy-makers can design scenarios and evaluate the effectiveness of social interventions through different simulations, and analyse how the P parameters, in the time horizon of T , can affect the response variables Θ t . Seven different scenarios were elaborated to reflect specific social interventions. Lockdown and conditional lockdown were the best evaluated scenarios in preserving lives. These scenarios present a slower evolution of the epidemic, a smaller number of infections and deaths. Given the impossibility of implementing lockdown policies, the scenario with 50% of social isolation with using masks and social distancing is the best approach in the preservation of lives. On the other hand, the vertical isolation scenario, is totally ineffective and resembles the ""Do nothing"" scenario. The results showed that COVID-ABS approach was capable to effectively simulate social intervention scenarios feasible with the results presented in the literature. Also, the results showed that policies adopted by some countries, for instance US, Sweden and Brazil, are ineffective when the objective is to preserve lives. Governments that chose to preserve the economy by not using severe isolation policies, fatally reached a situation with a high cost in human lives, and still embittered economic losses. The evidence provided by the simulation model shows that there is a false dichotomy between healthcare and the economy. In the scenarios where it was tried to save the economy by not taking hard social isolation policies, consequently, the social costs ended up impacting negatively into the economy. COVID-ABS is an open software and can be easily extended and customized. Also, new scenarios can be designed, taking into consideration the specificities of each region under study. Future research aims to improve the model by implementing mechanisms to close and open companies as well as allowing people to get fired. In addition, it will be integrated with optimization libraries, for automatic scenario creation, and multi-criteria decision making tools that could help governmental crisis committees to plan and manage the social policies to mitigate the COVID-19 effects.

83855,"The COVID-19 pandemic led several countries to resort to social distancing, the only known way to slow down the spread of the virus and keep the health system under control. Here we use an individual based model (IBM) to study how the duration, start date and intensity of quarantine affect the height and position of the peak of the infection curve. We show that stochastic effects, inherent to the model dynamics, lead to variable outcomes for the same set of parameters, making it crucial to compute the probability of each result. To simplify the analysis we divide the outcomes in only two categories, that we call {best and worst scenarios. Although long and intense quarantine is the best way to end the epidemic, it is very hard to implement in practice. Here we show that relatively short and intense quarantine periods can also be very effective in flattening the infection curve and even killing the virus, but the likelihood of such outcomes are low. Long quarantines of relatively low intensity, on the other hand, can delay the infection peak and reduce its size considerably with more than 50% probability, being a more effective policy than complete lockdown for short periods.","The COVID-19 pandemic led several countries to resort to social distancing, the only known way to slow down the spread of the virus and keep the health system under control.<q>We show that stochastic effects, inherent to the model dynamics, lead to variable outcomes for the same set of parameters, making it crucial to compute the probability of each result.<q>Here we show that relatively short and intense quarantine periods can also be very effective in flattening the infection curve and even killing the virus, but the likelihood of such outcomes are low.

We find that the comprehensive investigation policy for susceptible population and the quarantine for suspected cases eminently contribute to reduce casualties during the phase of the dramatic increase of diagnosed cases.

86707,"In this paper we considered an age-structured SEIRQ model, where the quarantine entrance parameters are thought as controls of the system, and we looked for the optimal controls via Pontryagin's maximum principle. After writing down the optimality system, we calculated the optimal controls numerically and analysed how some of the parameters influence the results. These parameters represent the difficult choices authorities must make, such as deciding how many essential workers are allowed to remain circulating, estimating the economic impact of the quarantine and even when to start it. As such choices are made, the optimal controls give guidelines of how to proceed. In Section 4, we considered a constant total control cost and distributed it among the age groups in four ways. The distribution with the best results with regard to deaths during the quarantine gave us a calendar of when to relax the isolation measures in the three age groups (for quarantine lengths of 30 and 60 days, respectively): • For the youngs, the date of relaxation was the 15th or the 13th day. • For the adults, the relaxation started at the 12th day or the 11th day. • For the elderly, it started at the 25th day or the 47th day. The optimal controls that induce this calendar produced a reduction in the number of deaths of 110 and 155 times, respectively, in comparison to the same period of time without quarantine. However, in both cases the number of infected cases reached a minimum just before the end of the simulation, so by the time the quarantine ended, the cases were going up again, even becoming bigger than the original values for the shorter length we considered. This shows that the quarantines are not effective if they are not long enough. We also showed that waiting too long to start the quarantine makes the period before the relaxation become longer. This also produced a loss in efficacy, since the reduction of deaths due to the quarantine (in comparison to the ""ng nothing"" scenario) appeared to be approximately inversely proportional to the number of initial cases. In our model we used data from Brazil as initial conditions. Brazil is a very large country, with many cities at different stages of the pandemic. This means that studies such as this one should be made locally to best suit the characteristics of each city. As the plots of Figure 3 suggest, the sooner the quarantine is implemented, the shortest the time the controls need to stay at their maximum is.

86726,"Our simulation based on the C-SEIR model has shown significant effectiveness of quarantine measures, which has been thoroughly exercised in China. While we applaud the success of these efforts, we must point out that this comes at a price much too high. In the hindsight, this could have been avoided by exercising a more proper (better balance between effectiveness and inconvenience) quarantine, but much earlier. The COVID-19 virus seems to be spreading globally, every country has a different scenarios and government reactions. For individuals, there are a few points to consider: (1) Be educated about the virus, e.g., its signature symptoms being fever and dry cough, unlike cold (running nose), and its prevention (not much different than preventing flu). (2) Be vigilant and take extra precaution. Avoid big gatherings, stay low in social activities, and keep social distances in daily lives. Cancel or postpone non-essential travels. (3) Quarantine if needed. Individuals with light symptoms, or having identified close contacts with those infected, should quarantine themselves in their own living places, or anywhere conditioned for the purpose. Individuals with strong symptoms should check in hospital. An alert and corroborating public is probably the most important for containing the epidemic. A recent article by the frontline health experts in China reported a death rate of 1.4% [7] . But outside Hubei province, the death rate seems to be much lower than this, down to 0.85%. The reported death rates outside China (e.g., U.S.) seem to be even lower. It is worth investigating whether the transmissibility of the virus would also reduce over time. Nevertheless, the COVID-19 virus is definitely more than a strong flu; therefore, it deserves extra precaution from individuals and well prepared medical resource from governments.

87282,"""All models are wrong, but some are useful"". This famous statement, attributed to the statistician George Box, sums up the usefulness of our model. Although it is not possible to predict the exact number of infected individuals, the model allows describing, in a qualitative way, the influence that different measures can have to mitigate the spreading of the coronavirus during a competition. Based on the simulations carried out with the epidemiological parameters estimated by the scientific community, the results of the study can be summarised in five points: • Reducing the days between matches reduces the risk of spreading COVID-19 throughout the season. The more the season is compressed, the less risk of contagion. • PCR tests should be performed on all football players participating in the competition. Antibody and antigen tests should be ruled out in this context because they are less reliable and are not effective until the disease is well advanced. • The tests should be carried out continuously along with the competition, with the optimum scenario being one test per day. • The player's environment is essential to avoid introducing the disease into the system. It is necessary that the players try to limit their social contacts as much as possible, and that their physical interaction with the technical staff is as distant as possible. • The process is highly unpredictable. While qualitative results are clear, obtaining precise predictions for a single realisation (the real case) is not possible. This is in agreement with recent work that warns about the strong sensitivity to parameter values in epidemics modelling [24] . We must also note that applying all the measures suggested by the model involves a cost. On the one hand, reducing the time between matches can be very physically demanding. The recovery time after a match would be reduced and the risk of injury would increase. To reduce this risk, teams should increase player rotations. Regarding the tests, football clubs should provide the necessary support and means to carry out such a high number of tests in such a short time. Without an adequate policy in this regard, the risk of reinfection in a competition would skyrocket. Players will also pay a personal cost to control the eventual spreading of coronavirus. Minimising their contacts with other individuals would mean limiting their travels, public events and, in general, reducing interactions with people outside the family environment. In fact, maintaining them in confinement during the rest of the season would be obviously the optimum situation. Finally, although the results shown here are focused on the resumption of the men's Spanish national league, the conclusions are equally valid for the women's competition. Furthermore, the model could be adapted to any competition in which matches involve some physical contact between players, such as basketball, handball or rugby.

87391,"We present below the simulation results of the model proposed, discuss the analysis and provide possible prediction of the Covid-19 pandemic in India and few states which are affected seriously. In population dynamics, one can express V as , V = N N/V = N D ; where, N is the total population in the geographical area, and D is the population density. Taking N as constant, we can correlate the change in V as change in the D by, V ∝ 1 D . We have studied the stochastic SEQIR model in the context of Covid-19 disease dynamics in India and its five comparatively worse affected states using stochastic methods. Our numerical simulation results show that policies like social distancing and quarantine have important roles in controlling the disease outbreak and we propose to optimize these two parameters to effectively intervene in the disease transmission. An important consequence of employing a stochastic method is the importance of demographic fluctuations, which are quite visible in the simulation results, to affect the disease dynamics and even in intervening the disease spread. This demographic stochasticity is generally neglected in its deterministic counterpart which is quite important in regulating any system dynamics. Hence, our stochastic simulation method could capture the demographic stochasticity which is non-negligible. We would like to mention that we do not intend to give quantitative predictions here. One limitation of the model under consideration is that by construction, populations from S and E compartments make transitions to the Q compartment where they are assumed to interact homogeneously. This may give rise to a more infected population and we do not see the trends of I(t) converging near zero over relatively less 300 days in our simulation. This also points out that policies such as social distancing and quarantine of the exposed population are not sufficient enough to end the COVID-19 disease outbreak. Other policies like complete lockdown and more testing of susceptible populations should be considered and must be incorporated systematically in mathematical models.

88317,"The results here suggest that stay-at-home orders in the United States are effective in limiting the spread of COVID-19 and provide some hope that the physical distancing measures now widely implemented are working to ""flatten the curve."" The results also suggest that stay-at-home orders dramatically reduced both the number of cases and fatalities that result from the disease. With that said, we note certain limitations in our analysis. Stay-at-home policies are ultimately assigned endogenously so, as with any observational study, we cannot say for certain that the associations we have measured are the result of a causal effect. Our tests of reverse causality suggest that stay-at-home orders influence case growth and not the other way around, but there is no way around the fact that these are observational data from which causal estimates are notoriously difficult to obtain. Our dependent variables --cases and fatalities --are based on incomplete data. It is well-known that rates of testing in the United States were extremely low in the early part of the pandemic, 2 , 21 so measures of cumulative cases and fatalities over time probably increased faster than the disease itself due to the addition of previously undetected infections. And many cases and fatalities may have gone undetected entirely. We attempt to control for this issue with county and time fixed effects and a measure of the growth in testing, but we are unlikely to have entirely adjusted for local variation in access to tests. Our independent variable, stay-at-home order status, measures a policy intervention that was often implemented simultaneously or within days of several other local interventions, such as bans on mass gatherings and closures of schools, non-essential businesses, and/or public areas. Given the uncertainty about how many days infected individuals are contagious both before and after the onset of symptoms, efforts to generate a sharp estimate of the effects of policies that were implemented within days of each other are difficult. Moreover, our analysis suggests these other local interventions might also have an effect on cases and fatalities. On average, the peak of infections happens three days prior to the stay-at-home order. In addition, we see significant reductions in the growth rate of cases and fatalities within days of the order. This is in spite of the fact that case identification during the early part of our observations was based on tests that often took a week to be resolved. 2 , 21 With our current empirical approach we cannot perfectly separate the effects of other local interventions from that of stay-at-home orders. This means that our estimates should properly be interpreted as the effect of stay-at-home orders bundled with effects of correlated local interventions. Our controls are the set of counties that did not issue mandatory orders, but in those localities residents may have voluntarily changed their social behaviors. As such, our estimates are the difference between the effects of an average bundle of changes in counties that issued orders relative to an average bundle of changes in counties that did not. An interesting question which we leave for future work is which local interventions in the policy mix helped the most. One final limitation is that we assume the effects of stay-at-home orders between localities are independent, but it is likely that significant spillovers exist. Consider the effect of the epidemic in New York City on neighboring counties in New Jersey, Connecticut, and as far away as Rhode Island. Or the effect of Mardi Gras in Louisiana or Spring Break in Florida on a variety of locales throughout the United States. This suggests significant spillover of infections. To the extent stay-at-home orders likewise spill over to other localities --as seems reasonable to assume --we have likely underestimated the effect of stay-at-home orders because control counties are partially treated by connections to counties with orders. It is important to note that COVID-19 cases and fatalities continue to grow in many areas in the United States. Only when the rate of growth turns negative will we know whether or not we slowed the disease in time to keep it from overrunning the health system capacity in various localities. There is much still to be done, and we are hopeful that the work here will help our fellow scientists, policymakers, and the public-at-large to plan for the next steps in managing this disease. ","The results here suggest that stay-at-home orders in the United States are effective in limiting the spread of COVID-19 and provide some hope that the physical distancing measures now widely implemented are working to ""flatten the curve.<q>With that said, we note certain limitations in our analysis.<q>Stay-at-home policies are ultimately assigned endogenously so, as with any observational study, we cannot say for certain that the associations we have measured are the result of a causal effect.

88916,"The control of the spread of the novel coronavirus on campus is a critical challenge for colleges and universities planning to open for in-person instruction in the fall. Our agent-based model of the spread and containment of this disease on campus is an effort to be as realistic as possible: engaging the current state of the epidemiological understanding of this illness as well as capturing some of the idiosyncrasies of the residential university setting. We are able to model behavior that is highly structured and fully individualized using a relatively manageable number of agents. This allows our model to more accurately capture disease dynamics than a traditional compartmental model. We find important implications for the impact of different control measures on both the spread of the disease and on the disruption of academic life. Our results suggest that it is important to have a robust portfolio of interventions, and that universities should be keenly focused on the specificity of their testing regime. Moving the largest classes online is an effective tool in the arsenal to stop the spread of the disease and to minimize the disruption caused by quarantining potentially exposed students. We also find significant differences between the risks involved with academic and other types of regular contact, with spread through broad social contact representing being more dangerous than residential contact in the extreme of many additional contacts. There are several important limitations of our analysis. First, we have not included seasonal effects in transmission patterns or the arrival of infections from off-campus. These effects may require additional control measures and have motivated several universities to shorten their semester to avoid extending into December. To gain some very basic understanding of the potential magnitude of the challenge this may present, we have included results in Tables 4 and 5 in the Appendix which suggest that the total number of those infected and the peak quarantine size depend linearly on the rate of infections from outside the university. There may also be additional unmodeled heterogeneity in the intensity of contact between students in different types of class settings: interactions in large lectures, small seminars, and labs may yield different transmission rates between students. Some students may also opt to continue their instruction remotely (e.g., due to travel restrictions), which will further decrease on-campus transmission for a given enrollment. Finally, we have not accounted for the fact that compliance with mask-wearing policies will likely be diminished in residential settings and social settings; our modeling leads us to believe that that this will lead to modest increases in infection and quarantine rates. Although we include instructors in this model, their off-campus behavior and infection risk is largely unmodeled. In the standard intervention, we find that a median of only 5 instructors are infected during the semester, so the effect of additional within-university interactions (between faculty and staff or administration, for example) may ultimately be a more significant risk to faculty than direct faculty-student interactions. Faculty and staff may also be exposed to the disease through their social and residential contacts: in an urban setting, for example, public transit may be a particularly significant risk to faculty and staff and may indirectly lead to more student infections as well. Finally, this model has limited applicability to other types of university settings, such as partial-residential and non-residential campuses. Small colleges may be importantly different than the university modeled here in that large classes are less common (and smaller) and that social networks may differ in ways that affect disease spread. Liberal arts colleges seem to present an especially difficult challenge since daily academic contacts would be much fewer (in a way that should be relatively easy to model) but of a sort more likely to transmit infection (which would be a more difficult feature to reasonably quantify or calibrate without additional data). Nonetheless, many of the main observations are likely to generalize well: increasing testing accuracy, limiting large classes, minimizing non-residential social contacts and preparing to accommodate unpredictable absences are likely to be useful across many contexts.

90226,"The impact of the COVID-19 crisis on the atmospheric environment and human activities are studied in this paper by comprehensively investigating the NTL radiance and AQI of every province and the entire Mainland China before and during the pandemic in both spatial and temporal dimensions. The activity ranges of citizens among different functional zones changed dramatically due to the COVID-19 related policies. The CBD and commercial centers became less bright in the NTL images and residential regions lit up. Most people followed the instructions and suggestions of the government and health department strictly to fight against the crisis and protect themselves. Although these changes and impacts bring unprecedented inconvenience to people's daily lives and work, the spread of COVID-19 was initially controlled in about two months. This gives an efficient reference for the rest of the world to make their own policies, strategies and decisions regarding how to control the spread of the virus. Since people stayed at home for nearly two months, some of their consumption and working habits have changed. For example, more people will be accustomed to online purchases and working from home, which will influence economic structures and the incomes of retailers. It has already been proven that NTL has a close relationship with the economy [34, 35] ; it should be used in the investigation of post-pandemic socioeconomic situations. In spite of all the worldwide catastrophes it has brought to human lives, health, economies and medical resources, COVID-19 has made our air cleaner. This may have some positive influences on the recovery of other respiratory diseases. Analytics are worth being done with medical data involved, which will give the decision makers more comprehensive support on the medical and first-aid resources arrangement. This paper tends to offer short-term qualitative analytics on how people and environment response to the COVID-19 crisis. The seasonal cycles, construction development and Spring Festival influences are not considered quantitatively in the analysis. In the future, all these factors will be calculated and removed from the trends by investigating long-term historic data to conduct quantitative analysis on correlation, regression and prediction. Despite the effort made by this paper and all the other research, more work is needed to be done on the impact of COVID-19, including: 1. The socioeconomic impact of COVID-19 will be examined by monitoring the change in economic conditions such as GDP, individual income and unemployment rate using NTL and census data. 2. As some analytics and news illustrated, the infection and death rates of COVID-19 have various patterns in different communities [36] . The NTL and other high-resolution remote sensing data sources can be used to distinguish community types in terms of income levels, races and occupations [37] . In the future, the COVID-19 spread and impact condition will be further studied in different human groups. 3. The investigation on air quality will be more detailed on some specific pollutants such as 1. The average NTL radiance decreases in most provinces and the entire country of China with the implementation of shutdown policies. Some exceptions are shown in several provinces due to their small number of confirmed cases, quarantine policies and low original NTL brightness. 2. The number of detected NTL pixels increases in the residential areas while it decreases in the commercial center regions, and generally stays the same in the transportation and public facilities during the studied pandemic time period. This reflects a transfer of human activities from shopping and entertainment centers to residential areas due to the quarantine policies. 3. The total air quality improved during the COVID-19 crisis because of the reduction in industrial production and vehicle usage. 4. The spread of COVID-19 and related policies have a significant impact on people's daily lives and the environment. These analytics can be further advanced with spatiotemporal and big data methodologies [38] for restraining the spread of COVID-19, medical resources arrangement, planning and implementing of reopening policies, estimating the economic loss and making financial plans.

90377,"We propose a simple SEIR-type model (SEIRQ), which includes the effects of testing and contact tracing. The model formulation allows to calculate an interpretable formula for the reproductive number R (2.2). As typical for this class of models, R depends on transmission parameters β. Increasing β corresponding in e.g. to higher frequency of social contacts increases R. Decreasing β, for example in consequence of widespread use of face masks, has the opposite effect. On the other hand γ d reflects the time to diagnosis and the formula indicates that more rapid diagnosis is associated with lower R. In addition, our model offers a clear interpretation of the quarantine effect. The transmission rate due to diagnosed cases, β d , is decreased by the factor θαγ d indicating that both the number of quarantined per diagnosed individual (α) and proper targeting of the quarantine (the infection rate among the quarantined θ) equally contribute to this factor. Also the parameter related to testing: the delay in diagnosis, γ −1 d , plays similar role. This quantifies the potential of a wide range of interventions to improve testing and contact tracing, as outlined in e.g. in ECDC recommendations [31] . In particular, as the number of people put in quarantine per each case and the infection rate among the quarantined impact R in similar fashion, our results support the recommendations to focus on the high risk contacts when the resources do not allow to follow all contacts. Our model takes into consideration only the effective contact tracing, i.e. the situation when the infected contacts are identified and put in quarantine before they become infectious. People who are identified later would be modelled as passing through one of the I states to the R states. This means that the number of quarantined in our model can be also increased by faster contact tracing. The timely identification of contacts may be a significant challenge in the quarantine approach given that the incubation time can be as short as 2 days in 25% of cases [3] . As mentioned by other Authors [28] , the delays in manual contact tracing are usually at least 3 days and under such circumstances the contact tracing and quarantine alone may be insufficient to control the epidemic. This could be improved with digital contact tracing. Notably, mixed contact tracing strategies implemented in South Korea indeed helped to control the epidemic at the early stages [32] . The use of ""smart contact tracing"" with mobile phone location data and administrative databases were also key to rapid identification and self-quarantine of contacts in Taiwan [33] and implementation of such strategy helped Singapore to control the epidemic without major disruptions of social activities [34] . We note that the quarantine effect relates only to transmission due to diagnosed cases. As expected, in order to control the epidemic the transmission due to undiagnosed cases has to be negligible. This can be controlled by general measures such as lockdown, which universally decrease the frequency of social contacts and are therefore likely to reduce β u . In our model the part of R representing transmission due to undiagnosed cases is scaled by (1 − κ) , the parameter relating to the efficiency of the testing system. Again, the examples of Singapore as well as the Italian village of Vo'Euganeo show that the widespread testing complementing the efficient contact tracing was essential to suppress epidemic. Testing unrelated to epidemiological links decreases (1 − κ) factor, thus making the factors impacting transmission due to diagnosed cases, such as quarantine, more powerful to decrease R. Further, our model allows to study the effect of the situation, in which the contact tracing capacities are exceeded. In this situation the epidemic is likely to quickly develop to the levels observed without quarantine. It is therefore quite crucial to implement the aggressive contact tracing system, when the epidemic is still at low levels and it is possible to bring the epidemic to suppression phase. We demonstrate the high impact of contact tracing and quarantine on the observed numbers of cases in Poland. This effect was coupled with substantial reduction in the transmission parameter β resulting from social contact restrictions. Depending on the scenario, β decreased by 76% to 84%, bringing R below 1. The estimated effect of the quarantine in Poland would depend on which of the considered scenarios regarding testing efficiency was the most relevant to our situation. In our model the quarantine is estimated to be the most effective for the scenario in which most of the cases are diagnosed (κ = 0.8). Testing strategies that comprise testing of all individuals with symptoms of respiratory illness could theoretically identify up to 82% of infected, assuming they would all present to medical care. This could be coupled with random screening of high risk individuals, in e.g. health care workers, or -in case of high incidence -even random screening of entire community to achieve the κ of the order of 0.8. The Polish clinical recommendations specifically mention only testing all individuals with severe infections [35] . In addition testing is provided to health care workers. The severe course corresponds to approximately 18% of all infections [3] . Therefore, the κ = 0.8 scenario is unlikely to be realistic in Poland. We believe that the plausible current κ in our country lies between 0.2 and 0.5. For these scenarios the model shows that the control of the epidemic is largely achieved through suppression of β. In case of relaxation of social contact restrictions, the efforts should be focused on increasing the level of testing in order to decrease the proportion of undiagnosed cases as well as maintaining or increasing the effectiveness of quarantine. For smaller κ, even substantially increasing the effectiveness of quarantine does not allow to go back to the level of social contacts from before the epidemic (β 1 ). Finally, the contact tracing effort was manageable in Poland due to relatively small number of cases. Should the case load increase substantially longer delays in contact tracing would occur, which can substantially decrease the effects of quarantine [27, 28] . Limitations and future directions of research. We do not consider the likely reduced transmission from undiagnosed cases who are more likely to be asymptomatic or paucisymtopmatic cases (β u < β d ). The reduction factor for infectiousness of asymptomatic is still under investigation. One study found a 60-fold lower viral loads in asymptomatic cases [29] , but another estimated the transmissibility reduction by 50% [6] . Moreover, we did not have sufficient data to include this additional parameter. We calibrated our model only to diagnosed cases, which were officially available. Calibration to mortality data is another approach successfully implemented in e.g. [25] that potentially removes bias due to different testing policies. As there were relatively fewer fatalities in Poland and little data on clinical progression we decided on simplified model without explicit modelling of the outcomes. Furthermore, we did not consider the sub-optimal adherence to quarantine. It is likely that some individuals would not fully comply to strict quarantine rules. However, only anecdotal evidence for such phenomenon is available at this time. In our model it would decrease the effective αθ, which was chosen to fit to observed number of people put in quarantine. Finally, the analysis of R is suitable for small size of epidemic, when S ≈ N . For other cases the results are still useful, but the approximation may be biased, as we have shown for β * . Due to little available data and policy changes we did not have sufficient data to determine which κ scenario is the most appropriate. In conclusion we present a simple model, which allows to understand the effects of testing, contact tracing and quarantining of the contacts. We apply the model to the data in Poland and we show that despite a substantial impact of contact tracing and quarantine, it is unlikely that the control of the epidemic could be achieved without any reduction of social contacts.

90434,"We can automatically detect different types of vehicle from satellite imagery, which can be indicators for underlying economic activity. We describe our workflow in the context of enforcing a stay-at-home order (Section III), but it can be used for different purposes, as we will discuss later. By using two publicly available datasets, xView and fMoW, we estimated how well our detector worked for 60 distinct classes of objects (Section IV-A) and exemplified how well we can perceive the flow of these objects over time (Section IV-B). These results show the potential of the proposed framework to address the intended problem, but miss the real thing -the COVID-19 outbreak. To evaluate our framework in real-world situations, we collected satellite imagery released to the press to illustrate the impact of the COVID-19 over the globe. It is worth noting that these are not always raw, high-resolution images, such as those provided by xView and fMoW. Many of these images had artifacts that impair automated analysis, like watermarks and low-resolution. We improved the detection outcome in some cases by upsampling the images or adjusting the confidence threshold. We believe these modifications would not be necessary if we had access to the original files. In Figure 8 (c), we show a drive-through COVID-19 testing site built in Munich, Germany. As can be seen, our automated count is very close to the real number and could help authorities to measure attendance over time in health facilities. Figures 9(a) and 9(b) show a car rental parking lot in the Phoenix Airport, Arizona, before and after the COVID-19 outbreak, respectively. As fewer people are traveling, the volume of parked vehicles increases substantially. This information serves not only to verify stay-at-home compliance but also to estimate the economic impact in a chain of companies such as car rental companies, airlines, insurance, etc. Finally, Figure 9 (e) shows car lines in a tollbooth at Wuhan, China, before the COVID-19 outbreak, and Figure 9(f) shows the same tollbooth empty after. This example shows how a simple redefinition of the list of strategic locations (e.g., in this case, to tollbooths, highways, and border crossings) allows our framework to detect traffic jams and migration flows. Repurposing the framework for other economic activities is simple. The places to monitor, i.e. roads, ports, etc., can be changed easily. The objects of interest can be changed, and our detector can handle many different options. See Figure 4 ... for a complete list. For instance, Figure 8 (a) shows an image from North Korean commercial vessels used to transport coal and other commodities, according to Christoph Koettl from the New York Times 4 , stopped in their home ports as an attempt to prevent the virus transmission. We did not find an image with a reasonable resolution before the outbreak. Still, according to other satellite data, this concentration of ships is not typical. Anyway, detecting maritime vessels in commercial ports can be an excellent indicator of economic activity, as maritime transport carries out more than 90% of the world's trade 5 . Figures 9(c) and 9(d) present another example of an economic indicator. They respectively show the number of grounded planes at the Munich International Airport in Germany before and after the COVID-19 outbreak, which, according to Jonathan O'Callaghan from Forbes 6 , has dramatically increased. Our framework can automatically produce the same observation. As our final visual example, in Figure 8 (b), we show a campaign hospital being built in a field 31 miles outside of Moscow, Russia, to treat COVID-19 patients, as reported by Dave Mosher from Business Insider 7 . We were able to detect different construction-related equipment, such as trucks, tents, and excavators. Although, in this case, the location must be determined beforehand, our framework can keep track of the construction site proportions, which in turn can indicate the magnitude of the outbreak in that location. Adaptations of the proposed framework could measure many other indicators. For instance, counting trucks on roads and highways, trains on railways and stations, or containers in dry ports are all possibilities of economic indicators that can also point out problems in the supply chain. Observing tractors in rural areas can help to evaluate agriculture activity, the same way the volume of vehicles in factories can assess the level of industrial activity. We are currently looking for high-resolution collection of satellite images over time to evaluate our framework under real, continual circumstances. To this end, we are seeking partnerships with the industry and government agencies to gain access to such data. With that, hopefully, we will be able to provide a flexible tool that can be explored by authorities during this COVID-19 outbreak or in future events demanding a similar awareness over human activities.

90662,"In the paper we present an SEIR model with Asymptomatic and Quarantined compartments to describe the recent and ongoing COVID-19 outbreak. Our model is intended to highlight the strength of three different non-pharmaceutical interventions imposed by public policies in containing the outbreak and the total number of disease-induced infections and deaths: -reduction of contact rate for a given portion of the population; -enforced quarantine for confirmed infectious individuals; -testing among the population to detect also asymptomatic infectious individuals. On one hand we show that, as expected, each of these interventions has a beneficial impact on flattening the curve of the outbreak. On the other hand, the comparison among different scenarios shows the remarkable efficacy of an early massive testing approach, when the limited number of infected individuals makes easier and more effective the tracing of recent contacts of the individual, as in Scenario D 1 , and of a timely lockdown, although in the presence of few confirmed infected cases, as in Scenario C 1 . In both situations, the timing of the intervention plays a crucial role on the incisiveness of the public safety policy. In addition, we give an explicit representation of the basic reproduction number in terms of the several parameters of the model, which allows to describe its dependence on the features of the virus and on the implemented non-pharmaceutical interventions. This description makes available a valuable tool to tune the public policies in order to control the outbreak of the epidemic, forcing R 0 below the threshold 1. However, considering the major effects of an enduring lockdown on the economy of the country that applies it, it is desirable to loosen the lockdown measures after the containment of the outbreak. Nevertheless, the decision makers and each individual shall be aware that a value of R 0 only barely greater than 1 would lead to an increase in the number of infected and dead by an order 2 of magnitude, thus provoking the collapse of the relative national health system. This is better explained by the following scenarios: consider a situation with constant testing ρ = 0.05 and no lockdown where, after the first 35 days of outbreak with a high R 0 (≈ 2), the population gains awareness of the risk and manage to reduce its contact rate so as to steer R 0 to either 0.9, 1 or 1.1. Figure 9 illustrates the large deviations among the outcome of these three different situations. In order to allow the population to circulate with no restrictions, it is necessary that herd immunity (see Remark 3.4) is achieved. The value that matters to compute this threshold of immunization is the basic reproduction number under no social distancing, which has been estimated in this article and in many others as being, in general, greater than 2.5. So achieving herd immunity would imply to infect at least 60% of the population, which would lead, with the current mortality rates, to 1-5% of the population dying, which is, obviously, a catastrophic unwanted situation. Hence, reinforcing what was said in the above paragraph, until a vaccine or treatment is not found, it is necessary to maintain the value of R 0 below 1. Otherwise, the curve of infections will always be increasing.

90802,"Current available data of the worldwide impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has been analyzed using dimensional analysis and self-similarity hypotheses. We show that the time series of infected population and deaths of the most impacted and unprepared countries exhibits an asymptotic power law behavior, compatible with the propagation of a signal in a fractal network. We propose a model which predicts an asymptotically self-similar expansion of deaths in time before containment, and the final death toll under total containment measures, as a function of the delay in taking those measures after the expansion is observed. The physics of the model resembles the expansion of a flame in a homogeneous domain with a fractal dimension 3.75. After containment measures are taken, the natural fractal structure of the network is drastically altered and a secondary evolution is observed. This evolution, akin to the homogeneous combustion in a static isolated enclosure with a final quenching, has a characteristic time of 20.1 days, according to available data of the pandemic behavior in China. The proposed model is remarkably consistent with available data, which supports the simplifying hypotheses made in the model. A universal formulation for a quarantine as a function of that delay is also proposed.","We propose a model which predicts an asymptotically self-similar expansion of deaths in time before containment, and the final death toll under total containment measures, as a function of the delay in taking those measures after the expansion is observed.<q>Current available data of the worldwide impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has been analyzed using dimensional analysis and self-similarity hypotheses.<q>We show that the time series of infected population and deaths of the most impacted and unprepared countries exhibits an asymptotic power law behavior, compatible with the propagation of a signal in a fractal network.

91030,"En el trabajo se exploraron dos descripciones de la pandemia. Una de ellas constituye un modelo empírico en el cual se considera que desde el punto en que se establece el confinamiento, la tasa de contagio debe, al menos, empezar a decrecer tendiendo cero después de un período de duración de la enfermedad (1/γ) (aproximadamente 15 a 20 días). Este modelo es capaz de describir bien el comportamiento de la epidemia en países como Alemania. El segundo es un modelo SIR con tasa de contagio variable, la cual se ajusta experimentalmente, y su variación se asume que se produce a consecuencia de la cuarentena. Estos análisis sugieren que la tasa de contagio a partir del día de aislamiento se comporta aproximadamente como una exponencial. Ambas descripciones coinciden, y el enfásis de ambos análisis radica en que un control de la epidemia sólo se logra con un confinamiento riguroso. Por lo cual analizando la evolución de la epidemia, resulta muy importante el monitorear los valores de β instantáneos para medir si el confinamiento está siendo lo estricto que se necesita. Esto es, con vistas a controlar la pandemia con un número de infectados muy inferior a la poblacion se requiere que en cierto período de días se cumpla la condicion β * − γ < 0 (R 0 < 1).

El modelo para la evolución de β aplicado al caso cubano, predice que la epidemia pudiera concluir inclusive a finales de abril o mediados de mayo si las medidas de aislamiento tomadas en el entorno del 24 de Marzo, resultaran efectivas. En este caso optimista, el máximo número de infectados podría resultar en cerca de 1000 − 2000 infectados activos con el máximo apareciendo entre finales de abril y el 12 de mayo. El valor del máximo crecería a medida que este tarde mas en realizarse. También en los modelos de β variables a pedazo en el tiempo, se asumió una implantación efectiva más tardía del aislamiento a finales de abril, que podría definir a finales de mayo un pico de infectados activos del orden de los miles de personas.

92954,"In previous sections, we already construct an epidemic SEIRA model and use the simulation analyze the effects of confirmed case isolation, personal protection and quarantine. In this section, we want to give a guideline about the non-pharmaceutical public health interventions before and during a pandemic. In this paper, we assume that no imported viral source to the system. In general, a ban for other countries only delay the peak, instead of prevent it. Ferguson et al. [15] find a 99.9% ban can postpone 6 weeks for United States. Therefore, we do not include the travel restrictions into our public health policy. We want to discuss the preparation for a government during this period. First of all, at the start of one pandemic, the government must pay attention to the asymptomatic rate. Compared the cumulative confirmed cases and deaths with low and high asymptomatic rate in Section 4.1, the proportion of asymptomatic viral carriers (with mild symptomatic patients) among all infections is an influential parameter of any viral transmission, also supported by Fraser Fraser et al. [16] . When there is limited local casts, the researchers must pay attention to foreign researchers result about asymptomatic rate. If the pandemic start at our country, health workers need to estimate the rate as soon as possible. Next, more tests are better. In general, at the beginning of one transmission, only symptomatic patients get tests. However, doctors cannot find asymptomatic patients in this situation, until one asymptomatic patient show typical symptoms. This test rule lead to overlook of asymptomatic infections. In fact, we should tests all contacts of every confirmed cases. Based on the results of these test, we can estimate the reproduction number R 0 and the asymptomatic rate r. Moreover, doctors should have the right to test potential infections with typical symptoms even though they do not have direct contacts with confirmed cases or travel history. As we all known, a dangerous sign of pandemic is community transmission without clear source, contradict to the previous rule. National Public Health Agency should permit doctors to do test for more patients without direct contacts or travel history. For laboratory confirmed cases, the compulsory self-isolation must apply to all direct contacts compulsory immediately. In Section 4.1, we also analyzed the spread of one virus if we miss one diagnosed case initially. In Section 4.2.1, we discussed the sensitivity of the effects for the policy to the epidemic. Besides test all direct contacts, the isolation of the household immediately is also necessary. Facing a new virus, the government should recommend general public take personal protection as soon as possible. When no information about an asymptomatic rate r, experts should assume there is asymptomatic patients. Compared the death and cumulative confirmed cases in Section 4.1, it is really dangerous to ignore this viral transmission. Because isolation of confirmed cases is hard to control it, a general personal protection is one of the best method. In addition, this method is also better than lock down policy. Although these two methods share similar inhibit effects, personal protection lead to fewer disruptions to the society and economic. Public health agency need to involve general public into the fight with epidemic as soon as possible, in order to avoid having to implement quarantine province-wide or nationwide. For general personal protections, there are several types, such as social distancing, washing hands, wearing mask and others. In these three methods, the first two are much easier than the third one. Washing hand is the most useful and economical method to protect people. However, when the virus is transmitted by droplets or aerosols, only depends on washing hands could lead to dreadful result. In this case, social distancing is essential. Unfortunately, the social distance require critical condition about the location. In many place, such as the vehicle of most public transportation, school, and many workplace, no enough space exists to keep social distance. In this situation, general maskwearing is a good substitution. Tellier [37] recommend use N95 respirators as part of personal protective equipment for aerosol transmission. Considering the storage amount and price of N95, it should be saved to people work in high risk area. Li et al. [29] the efficiency of surgical masks is 95%, compared with 97% for N95. As a result, an optimal choice for general public is surgical mask during an outbreak. Because of the paucity of research about homemade face masks, we cannot give any conclusion about homemade face mask in this paper. Before cumulative cases and death increase sharply, the government need take action to produce or purchase enough surgical and N95 face masks for both health workers and general population, and educate people about the correct method to wear a face mask and protect themselves on the same time. During a aerial transmitted disease, a combination of all three types of personal protections is indispensable. Last but not least, government need lock down an outbreak zone determinedly. Although any lock-down policy brings horrible outcomes in economic and society, it is the final policy to save life. In section 4.3, we already compare isolation, personal pretection and quarantine. An effective personal protection should show similar consequence with a quarantine. But when a disease is out of control, it means the rule of isolation and general personal action are too late or too liberal. In this situation, the government has to execute more rigorous policy to inhibit the transmission, i.e. closing school, cancellation of public gatherings, working from home, limited mass transportation, and national quarantine. In this paper, we construct two epidemic models. Firstly, the SEIRA model can be used to predict epidemic with asymptomatic viral carriers. Then to analyze the effect of different public health intervention, we use a SEIRA with policy model. By simulation, we find that asymptomatic rate r is crucial parameters for the health policy. When r ≥ 10%, government need to include general personal protection into their public health policy, especially wearing-mask for aerial transmitted virus. When there is a new virus with transmission by droplets or aerosols, the government must -Test all typical symptomatic suspects and direct contacts of confirmed cases -Estimate the proportion of asymptomatic viral carriers -Prepare sufficient N95 and relative equipment for health worker -Prepare enough surgical face masks for general public -Execute compulsory isolation of confirmed case and all contacts -Educate people with correct personal protection methods at the beginning -Enforce quarantine when an epidemic is unavoidable ","Ferguson et al.<q>In previous sections, we already construct an epidemic SEIRA model and use the simulation analyze the effects of confirmed case isolation, personal protection and quarantine.<q>In general, a ban for other countries only delay the peak, instead of prevent it.

93321,"In this article, we have proposed the generative BETS model for four key epidemiological events: beginning of exposure, end of exposure, time of transmission, and time of symptom onset. Under parametric models, we have derived the sample inclusion probability for exported cases and used it to correct for selection bias in the likelihood functions. Across different sub-samples and modeling assumptions, the initial epidemic doubling time for COVID-19 in Wuhan is consistently estimated to be between 2 to 2.5 days. Our nonparametric Bayesian analysis suggests that the parametric fit likely under-estimated the tail of the incubation period, and among all the COVID-19 patients who develop symptoms, about 5% of them could develop the symptoms at least 14 days after contracting the pathogenic virus. Gender-specific analysis shows that men may have a more variable incubation period than women. In particular, more men appear to show symptoms within two days of infection, which could be related to the men's higher death rate across the world [13] . We hope the generality of our model makes it extensible in further studies of the current pandemic and other outbreaks in the future. A key epidemiological parameter we decided not to study in this article is the basic reproduction number, commonly denoted by R 0 . Intuitively, R 0 is the expected number of secondary infections produced by a typical case in a population where everyone is susceptible. In early outbreak analysis, R 0 can be estimated from the epidemic growth exponent r by R 0 = 1/M (−r) [26] , where M (·) is the moment generating function for the distribution of the serial interval (time between successive cases in a chain of transmission). Several studies have attempted to estimate the serial interval of COVID-19 in Wuhan by using observed pairs of infector-infectees [17, 22, 9] . The reported point estimate of the mean serial interval ranging from 4.0 [9] to 7.5 days [17] . However, for most COVID-19 cases it seems impossible to ascertain the infector, so these early estimates of the serial interval could be severely biased by sample selection just like the early estimates of epidemic growth and incubation period as seen in Section 4. Our findings in this article should be viewed together with the limitations of our methodology. First of all, symptom onset time were usually reported by patients, who could be under social pressure to report a later symptom onset (for example, so they did not travel when showing symptoms). This can make estimated incubation longer than the truth. Second, although the contact tracing for travelers from Wuhan was intensive in the locations included in our dataset, some degree of underascertainment of Wuhan-exported cases is perhaps inevitable. If patients who showed symptoms earlier were less likely to be ascertained, our analysis may have over-estimated the speed of the epidemic growth. Third, the discernment of Wuhan-exported cases in Section 2.2 is not perfect; for example, there is ambiguity about where some COVID-19 cases were infected if they both had stayed in Wuhan and were exposed to other confirmed cases after their stay. Another potential limitation is the core assumptions that the disease transmission and progression are independent of traveling. This assumption is necessary to extend the conclusions from a ""shadow"" of the epidemic (Wuhan-exported cases) to the center of the outbreak, but it can be violated if, for example, some people canceled travel plans due to feeling sick. Finally, it is possible that the population of travelers is not representative of the general population in a meaningful way. Nevertheless, these limitations are perhaps minor compared to the selection bias identified in this article. Several authors have warned about selection bias and other statistical issues in COVID-19 studies [19, 20, 21, 11, 27] . By constructing a generative model and deriving the likelihood functions from first principles, we gave a quantitative assessment of the selection bias in several high-impact studies. We found that the biases were indeed startling. This highlights the lesson that data quality and methodical consideration of selection bias are often much more important than data quantity and specific models. This is especially important in high-stakes decisions like the ones for the COVID-19 pandemic. In a world where data science is playing an ever-larger role in policy making, ignoring selection bias could become the most costly of bets.  For b = 0, we can replace λ V in the above equation by λ W . The idea is that, if rL is much larger than 1 (in our preliminary analysis rL ≈ 0.25 × 54 = 13.5), then Right hand side of (26) ≈ νλ W κ r 2 exp(rL) when b = 0. Using this approximation, we obtain db ≈ κ exp(rL)ν r 2 (1 − π)λ W + πλ V (1 − 2/(rL)) . In the last step we used the approximation e rL 1 + rL: Therefore, the density is given by where ρ = (λ V /λ W )π/(1 − π).

93387,"In this prevalence of pandemic COVID-19, ODE based kinetic models are being trusted extensively for the purpose of predicting time dependent profiles and steady state behaviour of the epidemic dynamics. In this paper, we argue that cellular automata based simulations can provide a more realistic and insightful platform for modeling this dynamics. It is undeniable that a substantial variability has been observed in the nature of the course of the disease in countries and provinces all around the world. While a fully operational clinically trialed vaccine can only be expected after a year or so for everyone, several countries are struggling hard to find a proper mitigation strategy for the disease. It is interesting to see that publicly available data of confirmed daily cases for different countries are quite different from each other. While in some countries the disease has completed its course in around 60 days (like, Germany, Switzerland, Singapore etc.), in some other countries it is taking more than 80 days to reach the peak (like, Italy, India, Brazil etc.). In countries like Spain, Portugal and Turkey, a distinct departure from symmetric bell-shaped behaviour of active cases can be observed, which is heading towards a saturation, indicating a substantial persistence of the disease. For Iran, emergence of a second peak is imminent, which cannot be accounted for using ordinary differential equation based SIR models. Many countries have shown equivalent rise of the epidemic in initial stages are showing drastic divergence in the later stages. The applicability of strategies like aggressive testing, which found their success in countries like Singapore, Hong Kong and South Korea, are doubted for the high population countries like, India, USA etc. To analyse and interpret this data, it must be considered that along with the parameters associated with infection itself, the dynamics reflects the human interventions and reactions as well, which are highly probabilistic. In this paper, we have used a lattice-based PCA epidemiological modeling to efficiently mimic a pandemic environment and find out the contributions of each major parameter associated with the pandemic spread. We identified the role of different factors like probability of exposure, testing probability, promptness of implementing lockdown etc. which can not only be used to design better strategies to control a pandemic like COVID-19, but also can be used as analyzing tools to understand and explain proposed initiatives like social distancing, usage of facial mask, importance of sanitizers etc. Our exhaustive analysis shows that countries with high population density should handle lockdown and migration carefully as they have higher risk of getting infected. Using quantities like i max and τ , we have also characterised and quantified the independence of rise and fall of the distribution, showing the clear influence of human intervention strategies. Our model individually associates tunable parameters with several practical factors like population density, testing efficiency, public awareness, health-care facility, general immunity etc. which are implicit to a country, and can contribute significantly in the country-wise data variations. By demonstrating the flexibility of the model, we conclude that this is not only capable of explaining the reasons behind divergence of epidemic dynamics in different countries, but also has the potential to explain unforeseen nature of a new data that might depend strongly on space information, behavioural probabilities or underlying fluctuations. Our study establishes a prescription about how the resultant distribution changes its properties (e.g., peak position, sharpness of rise, lifetime of epidemic, asymmetric long-tailed fall etc.) driven by each of these parameters. As this simulation-based study explicitly includes the spatial factors into the dynamics, incorporating realistic behavioural and demographic features is achievable through this model. Thus, our methodology proposes a more accurate and flexible platform to understand the country-wise diversity of the observed data than the mean-field models.

93430,"We proposed an SI epidemic spreading model with effective time-dependent infectivity that models different types of containment measures. This theoretical framework can be used to investigate the onset of an epidemics and the role that a time-dependent infectivity can have on the spread of the disease. We demonstrated that different containment measures can either lead to a slowing down of the exponential spread by modulating the rate µ of the exponential growth of new case, or can bring the epidemic to an halt when they push the dynamics in the subcritical regime. In particular, exponential and generalized exponential temporal kernels always induce a finite epidemic threshold λ c , so they are able to stop epidemics provided that λ < λ c . For power-law temporal kernels, the effective infectivity is able to induce a non-vanishing epidemic threshold only if they are steep enough, viz. if the power-law exponent α determining their decay exceeds unity: α > 1. For different temporal kernels of the infectivity, in the supercritical regime, λ > λ c , the total number of infected individuals grows exponentially fast; in the subcritical regime, i.e. below the epidemic threshold, the total number of infected individuals saturates to a constant; in the critical regime, the number of infected individuals grows in time linearly or sub-linearly. These results have been obtained assuming a well-mixed approximation and by considering a single focus of the epidemic. We also investigated the growth of the total number of cases in a pandemic formed by a growing set of epidemic foci, each having at least one infected individual. We studied the simplest situation with each focus follows the same dynamics. We showed that if the number of new foci increases a a power-law of time, in the supercritical regime the total number of cases across different foci scales like the total number of case in each focus. In the critical (and subcritical) regime, the total number of cases across different foci can grow faster than linearly. When the number of new foci increases exponentially the growth of the number of cases across different foci is always growing exponentially at the rate at which the new foci are established with the only exception when the growth rate µ of the number of new cases in each single focus is faster, in which case the total number of infected across different foci grows at rate µ. There are many avenues for future work. An obvious generalization is to consider SIR and SIS model including the same time-dependent effective infectivity. Perhaps the most important challenge is to model stochastic characteristics and try to account for large fluctuations observed in pandemics. Stochastic characteristics are difficult to describe even in the classical SIR model in the critical regime [37] [38] [39] [40] [41] [42] [43] [44] , and they may play an important role in our model. Finally the multi-foci meta-population approach could be expanded by considering the effect of social and transportation networks. gets, however, the regular expansion, e.g. in the next order from which we would get t≥1 t(t − 1) n(t) x t−2 2C 2 and conclude that n(t) decays faster than t −3 . Proceed-ing, one finds that n(t) seemingly decays faster than any power of time. Recall, that for the power-law kernel the decay of n(t) in the subcritical regime is qualitatively the same as the decay of the kernel F (τ ). This may occur also for the generalized exponential kernel, and our simulation results agree with this conjecture. Theoretically, however, we only established that the decay of n(t) is faster than any power law.

93639,"From the theoretical layout discussed above, we can get the time evolution of the four categories in a population (susceptibles, infectives, cured and dead) for given rates of the respective processes. Hence, from the available data, if we are able to extract the said rates of conversion, we can predict the future scenario of the COVID-19 pandemic for different regions in the world. Let us take the example of India. The case in India was reported on 30 th January, 2020. From then, the count of infection has seen an exponential increase reaching 24,434 on 24 th April, 2020. The death toll has reached 780 the first one being reported on 12 th March (source: www.covid19india.org). However, the number of patients recovering also increases exponentially, although at a lower rate as compared to the infection. From the data we extract the rate constants as given in Table II . We use these values to estimate R 0 to be ∼6. Nevertheless, the value of R 0 evolves over time as the people and government take protective measures. As mentioned above the span of the values of rate constants can depend on region, average age of population and other important factors. From Fig. 4 we can see that the behaviour of the evolution of S, I and R changes with the changing nature of the time-dependence of infection rate. Interestingly, with the periodic variation of R 0 we can see a bimodal nature in the I vs time plot. This mimics the data from China. The periodic variation in the rate might happen when after a certain time the preventive measures are relaxed. We verify the evolution of the stratified population as obtained from the mathematical model by our stochastic cellular automata simulations. The results are presented in the right hand side column of Fig. 4(b, d, f) . Three functional forms of the transmission probability (P T r ) are used to define its time dependence. These are exponential [Eq. 14], logistic [Eq. 15] and square cosine [Eq. 16] functions as used in the previous mathematical analysis. Here, T = total number of simulation steps. The value of P T r is varied from 1.0 to 0.1 with the time evolution of the simulation according to these functions. The numerical values of the parameters mentioned in the equations are obtained by trial and error to compare with the mathematical solution of the SIR model. Under comparable set of parameters, we find similar patterns of temporal evolution of population from both the generalized SIR model and CA simulation. The striking similarity of the results obtained from the two formalisms helps in validation of our CA simulation protocol. The following sets of parameters (Tab. III) were used in each of the three simulations. Another important and relatively less discussed quantity is the fraction of new infection (I new ). In Fig. 5 we show the time evolution of total active infected population [I(t)] and newly infected population [I new (t)] for three different kinds of time dependent R 0 . These analyses show that the maxima in the new cases peak before the maxima of the total number of active infections. We observe a second peak in I new (t) when R 0 varied periodically with time. This can be attributed to the second pandemic wave. [39] One is free to incorporate other kinds of temporal variation of the rate constants to explain the date of a specific reigion. Here, we study the temporal evolutions of the different categories of the society as functions of the different parameters defined in the CA simulation. All the results presented here are averaged over 100 individual simulations. While COVID-19 has certain similarities with earlier epidemics (measles, small pox), there are certain remarkable features that distinguish the former from other pandemics. One important difference is that the immunity or the probability of getting infected depends on several factors that can be identified. Clearly, the accumulation of data across countries has become more accessible to general public and scientists alike. Secondly, the presence of a large number of asymptotic carriers which pose a serious threat to other less fortunate. In addition, there are certain similarities across the countries, as there are differences. Many of the emerging patterns are yet to be understood. It appears that modelling needs to be more generalized than those usually employed. There is an urgent need for understanding the dependencies. The most common model used in modelling epidemics is the SIR model, already discussed here. We have discussed why this model might not be appropriate for the COVID-19 pandemic. In this work we have employed two generalized schemes to model COVID-19 pandemic: (i) a modified SIR model and (ii) a stochastic cellular automata simulations to understand the spatio-temporal evolution of a population undergoing a pandemic crisis. The key outcomes from the present study are as follows. 1. The time evolution of the fractions of S, I and R in a population is dependent on the time-dependence of rate of infection. This is represented here in terms of k S→I (t). This in turn get translated to Similar dependence is also seen in the CA simulations where the transmission probabilities (P T r ) are made time dependent. When a pandemic starts in a region (country for example) the nature of the spread is often unknown. Hence a proper protocol to control the spread and make the citizens cautious takes time. For this reason, the rate of transmission is higher in the beginning. With progress of time, this rate decreases as people learn more about the safety protocols. Sometimes, the rate may show oscillatory behaviour because of the heterogeneity of the population. Hence, time-dependence of the rate of transmission is an important factor. 2. From CA simulations, we find that both home quarantine and social distancing (for people coming out of their homes) are effective measures to fight the crisis of the spread of an infectious disease. However, even with utmost caution while out of home (low probability of getting infected), the peak of the infection curve do not show significant shift. On the other hand, the fraction of people quarantined strongly affects the position of the peak. Hence, staying at ones home is the best policy during the spread of an infectious disease. 3. Because of the conservation of the sum over subpopulations, the coupled equations become non-linear. This implies that an analysis of response to fluctuations in the control parameters might reveal interesting information. Such work is under progress. 4. We also find that the incubation period of the virus plays an important role in determining the fate of the time progression of the pandemic. Longer the incubation period, (high probability of remaining infected) lesser are the chances that the infected individual will be symptomatic. Hence the disease in that person cannot be detected easily. As a result, this individual poses a severe threat of infection for the nearby susceptible population. Other factors, like age distribution, initial population density of susceptibles, and time of lock-down of national borders are also major contributing issues that determine the spread of the disease. The rate constants, which are the parameters in the SIR model, represent average rates involving several factors (as mentioned above) that affect the overall temporal evolution of the population. We include these factors as parameters in terms of probabilities in the CA simulations. This not only gives us a better understanding of the roles of these individual factors but also allow us a more microscopic view into the physical map of a region affected by the spread of an infectious disease. However, it should be noted that both the model and the simulation produce limited results because of the inherent inhomogeneous nature of any pandemic and the limited availability of data. The models can be applied to small local geographical regions. However, they may fail to predict the outcome in a global picture.

93836,"NPIs such as lockdown or social distancing each carry a cost (including, but not limited to, economic, medical, social and ethical costs). This can differ substantially between interventions. For measures that treat different age groups differently, age-structured models can be used to assess the their differential impact. Similar remarks apply to other types of compartmenting in more general models, for instance by geographic, social or industrial sector, as we plan to consider in subsequent reports. By representing NPIs through their effects on contact matrices, PyRoss can provide Bayesian forecasts of the impact of specific interventions (albeit limited in the currently implemented examples to the age-structured case). Intervention strategies that extremise imputed costs can then be found without leaving the platform. The optimisation methodology provided within PyRoss a principled way of minimising harm in sustained application of NPIs. The exact definition of 'harm' is of course controversial and subjective. To create a well posed optimization problem, the first step is formulation of a cost function which encodes mathematically how one type of harm (such as fatalities) is weighed against another (such as unemployment). For obvious reasons, PyRoss leaves the choice of cost function to the user, although a schematic example of the approach is described later in this report. 8  This report has presented an overview of PyRoss, a Python library that integrates compartment models of epidemics with Bayesian inference and optimization tools. The current focus of PyRoss, and hence of this report, is on well-mixed, age-structured models with a modest number of contact channels (home, school, workplace, other). However, PyRoss allows these channels to be expanded indefinitely in principle, so that more complex contact information relating to particular working or social environments can be incorporated as available. Likewise PyRoss allows the disease stages themselves to be subdivided at will. This enables the statistics of objective medical states, such as hospitalization and intensive care or ventilator use, to be modelled. By also allowing an indefinitely expandable number of compartments per disease stage, the residence time distribution in such stages can be varied from the exponential decay of simple compartment models to the sharply-peaked distribution that underlies time-since-infection models [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] . Certain other mathematical limitations can be overcome similarly. NPIs are viewed within PyRoss as strategies to influence contact matrices, generally in a time-dependent fashion, through variations in contact rate, or transmission rate at contact, or both. These interventions can be represented in as much social detail as is resolved by the contact matrices themselves. A Bayesian system of inference for model parameters, and for forecasting with error estimation, is fully integrated into PyRoss. The former is a crucial feature which allows comparison between models based on evidence. This can guide a principled expansion in the number of compartments up to a level of granularity justified by the data, and can warn when this has gone too far. The approach guards against over-fitting of historic data, leading to precise but inaccurate forecasting -a risk faced by parameter-rich, data-poor models in any field of science. One can expect robust inference from historic data to prove crucial for forecasting the future course of an epidemic, particularly where sequenced or nuanced NPIs are involved. Accordingly, PyRoss's Bayesian parameter estimation tools allow the fitting of time-dependent contact-matrix parameters representing NPIs. Prior estimates (supplied perhaps by expert judgement) of the effect of an NPI on contact statistics can therefore be continuously improved, after the NPI is implemented, by feeding the observed results back into the system (Fig. 2.0.1) . Observed outcomes for one NPI (such as sudden lockdown) can inform the prediction of others (such as a sequential, age-stratified unlock). Within PyRoss, given a user-defined cost function that encodes their harm, NPIs can be optimized and ranked by minimization of the chosen cost function. The actual choice of cost functions is, of course, morally and politically problematic. However, there are many other areas of planning where saving life is weighed against economic cost, including decisions about where and whether to build a new hospital, or indeed a new road. The principles of compartment modelling embraced by PyRoss, when constrained by a disciplined approach to parameter and uncertainty estimation, are, we believe, more powerful than is widely assumed, but of course not all-powerful. Known challenges include situations in which the well-mixed approximation does not hold at small scales, such as the fact that isolation by household can allow rapid disease spread within each household while preventing it at societal level. Redesign of the compartment structure to reflect a different 'unit of infection', such as a household, may help in some such cases. In contrast, there is no problem of principle in extending compartment models to societies that are locally well mixed but heterogeneous at larger scales. Different contact matrices can be assigned at regional level and/or to micro-locations such as specific workplaces or social venues. Once such geo-social compartments are resolved, the transition rates between them are controlled by human mobility which can itself be modelled by jumps into and out of compartments representing journeys (within which infection can of course occur). NPIs can then separately target either the locationally specific contact matrices, or the transfer of people between locations. In a forthcoming report we will describe PyRossGeo, an extension of PyRoss along these lines. This report has focussed on the design principles and capabilities of PyRoss, illustrated by very simple examples of its use. We have not deployed it directly here to address aspects of the current COVID-19 crisis, but for an example of its use in ng so, see [16] . (Note that since that paper was written, the capabilities of PyRoss have advanced dramatically.) The PyRoss library is open-source. We positively encourage its use by other scientists, whether seasoned epidemic modellers or those new to the field. We hope it can contribute to a stronger scientific platform for evidence-based decision making as the current pandemic continues, and also before the next one.

We first share our insights about level of activity of the users who tweeted in Persian around COVID-19 over time. Next, we look at the correlation between different types of COVID-related tweets with the the official number of confirmed cases in Iran. Lastly, we outline the result of our analysis on the content of the tweets to show what topics were mostly talked about among the users around COVID-19 during this ongoing crisis. Related to the topic and content, we additionally broke down the tweets in terms of the type of the language users used when responding to COVID-19. In this paper, we collected more than 530,000 original tweets in Persian/Farsi related to COVID-19 pandemic over time and analyzed the content in terms of major topics of discussion and the broader category of tweets. We applied a combination of manual annotation of a random sample of tweets and topic modeling tools to classify the contents and frequency of each category of topics. We identified the top 25 topics among which living experience under home quarantine emerged as a major talking point. We additionally categorized broader contents of tweets that show satire, followed by news, is the dominant tweet type among the Iranian users. There are a few next steps and directions that we are actively working on. 1) We are interested to understand how COVID-19 related conversations among Iranian users shifted and evolved over time by tracking discussion topics within specific time windows, 2) Continue to conduct manual annotation of tweets for our topic analysis, as a continuation of content analysis described in section 3.2, for the newly added data points we collect. We expect these annotations to help us to better understand and measure publicâȂŹs reaction to the pandemic and to the specific events that unfolded over time, 3) we are interested to conduct a deeper analysis on the factuality of news and information shared on twitter and categorizing the different types of information in terms of validity and accuracy. While we briefly mentioned in section B examples of false information in collected tweets, we aim to find additional types of mis/dis-information. For example, we see examples of wrong information and claims about vaccines or treatments for corona-virus in the early days creating a black market for sales of these products. We are running more analysis to initially find the themes of such false information and additionally identify different strategies that are being used for spreading it.

95820,"The COVID-19 is spreading world-wide but stopped spreading in China. Since the spread of the disease is highly related to population migration, it follows a Lévy flight behavior which is characteristic of human mobility [20] . The long incubating period together with the Lévy flight long jumps makes the disease very hard to control and raise the alarm for the other countries. By the time that infected individual is being detectable (5 days in the best scenario), one can already perform a long-distance trip and further spread the disease. This is the reason why quarantines are so critical not only for infected persons, but also for others that were nearby infected individuals. The lifetime of the disease in a city is characterized by two stages, uncontrolled infection in early times and decaying stage at later times once quarantines are being performed. These two stages can explain the disease situation in China and predict the situation in other locations in the world if similar strategies will be adopted. The stage of the disease in China is almost stable although it is the country with most of infection cases (as for 18 of March 2020). The reasoning is that most of the infected cities in China applied strict quarantine measures, leading to exponential decay of disease. However, in other locations around the world, most of the cities are still at the early stages at which the disease is less controlled and may lead to another or even worse outbreak at high risks.

96124,"These three possible future scenarios are consistent with the actual situation of the epidemic in Brazil. That is, with respect to the actual data available to date, the three scenarios are possible and depend exclusively on how future actions related to social behavior will be taken. In this respect, the development of epidemiological models capable of predicting the evolution of the epidemic in the face of social behavior is an important tool for raising awareness, shedding some light on many aspects of the disease pattern and providing strength to the scientific dissemination about the importance of the social responsibility involved in quarantine measures. After all, apparently, although other epidemics may arise in the future, more or less severe than that caused by SARS-CoV-2, the results of such natural phenomena, in terms of the number of infected and dead individuals, depend essentially on human behavior and the priority given to the processes of reducing susceptibility. The results obtained from modeling the SARS-COV-2 epidemic evolution in Brazil allow one to draw up estimates and predictions for the future scenario of the disease progress in the country. As discussed, both scenarios -the worrying and the controlable -are possible and compatible with the current data. In this context, dissemination of scientific facts and awareness-raising campaigns are of paramount worthness, shedding some light on the importance of isolation policies during epidemic situations. In this article, we reformulated the SIR model to comply with the hypotheses of a susceptible population that grows over time and varies with mortality and birth rates. As well as being able to model susceptibility reductions in function of social measures for controling the epidemic advance. We explored the case of the epidemic evolution in Brazil, a worth issue since it could mean, given the characteristics of the country, a considerable impact on the global economy, not to mention the serious consequences to the country's economic and social structure. We conclude that, within the social and economic possibilities of the country, it is prudent to foster the maintenance of quarantine policies in order to avoid mass contamination of the population in April, 2020. Nevertheless, the daily updating of data linked to the current situation of the country must be perpetuated, since, for many reasons, it is possible that, to the date, the number of cases are underestimated and, thus, the forecasts provided here may change significantly due to new updates of the real situation in the country.

97039,"This is not the first time telehealth is used during a pandemic. China has first explored use of telehealth in 2003 during the outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) . Private telemedicine companies provided services to victims of hurricane Harvey and primary care providers 51 . The NATO (North Atlantic Treaty Alliance) is using their developed Multinational Telemedicine systems with their military forces during various crises (Doarn et al 2018) . During COVID-19 multiple countries (Singapore and USA) are using different forms such as chatbot, videoconferencing etc. to triage and care patients remotely 52 . Overall, the telehealth has a number of key strengths to provide quality care and enhanced emergency response not only in regular situations but also in hazardous situations (environmental or biological). Despite many obvious benefits of telehealth, the actual uptake and integration of it into mainstream practice has been slow. In many countries, past talks about remote examinations or consultations with patients was at least met with disdain (as substandard to in-person), if not completely taboo or legally prohibited. During the pandemic this has changed dramatically with countries such as France, Italy, Japan and the US enabling new health services to be provided through telemedicine and be reimbursed. This results in many patients having now personally experienced digital medicine. This together with the reported contagion rate of COVID-19 in the clinical environment leading to clusters of nosocomial infections made patients understand the potential risks associated with visiting clinics or hospitals. We expect that COVID-19 pandemic will have a profound impact on the way physicians and healthcare delivery organizations interact with patients and the general population. In particular, face-to-face patient-doctor contacts will be less common and remote monitoring be facilitated by the increasing number of clinical grade portable medical devices. It is sensible to foresee the COVID-19 era as a trigger for adopting these long existing yet never consecrated technologies. With new technology, come deep privacy concerns, from the rise of automated face recognition (something we all feared just one year ago) to dystopian tracking of individual's behaviors and the loss of identity through theft. Notably, the increased potential for being tracked or hacked (or zoom-bombed during a consult for example), are perhaps the biggest fears in remote monitoring these days. Even in times of urgent need, we are still seeing these fears trumping effective contact tracing. It remains to be seen how the recently announced (but yet to be explained) Google/Apple partnership for contact tracing plays out, but a backlash against the industrial big brother cellular operating system's duopoly is inevitable. We already see Apple and the government of France at loggerheads over who will own the contract tracing space. Nevertheless, in the absence of government leadership in this domain in many countries, this is probably the only hope many regions have in implementing large-scale contact tracing, and may be the only hope of dealing with the issue across national boundaries. In summary, the need for testing, symptom triage, contact tracing, remote monitoring of mild COVID-19 patients and targeted lockdowns at early stages is driving most of the innovation in remote sensing in the time of a pandemic. It is difficult to innovate beyond this without creating extra burden or running head-long into privacy issues that may ultimately defeat the original positive intentions. The utility of heart rate and respiration rate from video cameras has yet to be proven, but certainly has real potential, with many telemedicine providers seriously considering this technology as an adjunct to video review. Despite the best efforts of companies like Babylon Health, we are still a long way from the automated 'artificially intelligent' consult, or even a COVID-19 specific screening and triage system based on standard machine learning.

97159,"Like any mathematical model, the model presented in this paper does not exactly describe COVID19 disease, even if it shares with this most of its characteristic. Furthermore, for this new disease many aspects are still unknown, such as the level of infectivity of asymptomatic patients. Our goal is to understand how a disease similar to the COVID19 spread over in a closed population and to answer to some specific research questions. What we have obtained can be summarized as follows: 1. Reducing the number of contacts of each individual the spread of the disease slow down, the pressure on the health system is reduces, but we end up with a similar number of deceased. 2. It is basic to start the quarantine at least when the first severe patient is detected. Waiting for the first deceased leads to many more additional deceased. 3. To raise the quarantine it is very important to know the level of infectivity of the asymptomatic. The more infectious they are, the more important is the quarantine. 4. To stop the disease you must perform a strict and long quarantine and start it as soon as possible. 5. Group immunity is very important to prevent the development of the disease. Even if most of the answers are the expected ones, we have obtained these through a sound stochastic epidemic model, that despite of its simplicity probably is able to catch most of the peculiarity of this model. We believe that a more sophisticated version of this model and more elaborated simulations can allow us to answer to more complex questions, but probably it will be better to wait when a deeper knowledge on this disease will be available.

97310,"The results show a generally strong correlation between strengthening of the quarantine controls, i.e. increasing Q(t) as learnt by the neural network model; actions taken by the regions' respective governments; and decrease of the effective reproduction number R t . For example, in Italy, government restrictions reportedly (Ghiglione et al. 2020) tightened during the week preceding mid March, which is also when our model shows a sharp increase in Q(t) and corresponding decrease in R t (figures 4b, c). For Wuhan and South Korea, similar cusps in government interventions took place earlier, in the weeks leading to and after the end of January (Cyranoski 2020) and February, respectively (Normille 2020) . These cusps were also captured well by our model (Figures 2b, c and  6b , c, respectively). Even for the USA, Q(t) shows a stagnation till 20 March 2020, after which it shows a sharp increase accompanied with a decrease in R t (Figures 8b, c) , which is in alignment with the ramping up of government policies and quarantine interventions post mid March in the worst affected states like New York, New Jersey, California, and Michigan. A comparative analysis of the quarantine strength function Q(t) learned by the neural network for different countries reveals that Wuhan had the highest magnitude and South Korea had the highest growth rate of Q(t). This can be attributed to the stringent government interventions and strict public health measures including immediate isolation and quarantine impositions in Wuhan and South Korea. This eventually resulted in the halting of infection spread and a corresponding R t < 1 within a month for Wuhan ( Figure  2c ) and within 20 days for South Korea (figure 6c) after the first signs of a pandemic were recognized. It is reported that the infected case count stagnated nation-wide in China by the beginning of March (Cyranoski 2020 ) and in South Korea by the end of March (Fisher & Sang-Hun 2020) ; which eventually led to a stagnation in the quarantine interventions employed in these countries. This is in general qualitative agreement with our forecasting results which show a plateau in Q(t) and R t at R t < 1: Figures 3a,b and 7a ,b. In Italy, as of March 20 th , I(t) is appearing to be linear (Figure 4a) , which is consistent with lower rates of infections being actually reported (Horowitz & Kirkpatrick 2020 ) and can be taken as a precursor to stagnation. It is also consistent with adoption of strict movement restrictions by the government shortly before the March 20 th date. We forecast that, for Italy, R t will drop below 1 and Q(t), R t both will stagnate between mid to end of April 2020 (Figure 5a , b) indicating halting of the spread of infection. Owing to the relaxed quarantine and isolation policies in the US in its initial stages post the infection spread, our model converges to Q(t) ≈ 0.4 − 0.6 ( Figure 8b ) which is the smallest compared to other regions. Even though the effective R t is still greater than 1 as of April 1 2020 (Figure 8c) , its growth has started to show a decreasing trend and we expect the infection to start showing stagnation with R t < 1 by 20 April 2020 if the current US policies continue without change (Figures 9b, 10a ). This will be accompanied by a continuous ramp up of quarantine policies (Figure 9a ). At its peak, we forecast the infected count to reach approximately 600,000 before stagnation, again assuming no change in US policies. Our mixed model analysis for USA, employing Q(t) learnt from the models of Wuhan, Italy and South Korea in the USA model starting from 1 April 2020, reveals that stronger quarantine policies (Figure 10b ) might lead to an accelerated plateauing in the infected case count, as shown in Figure 10a , and subsequently smaller infected case count. On the other hand, in agreement with National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases estimates (Miller 2020) , we forecast that relaxing or abandoning the quarantine policies gradually over the period of the next 17 days may well lead to ∼ 1 million infections without any stagnation in the infected case count (Figure 10a ) by mid April 2020.

97881,"We have made inference on publicly available data of the COVID-19 pandemics in Italy through application of a SEIR model and the use of statistical techniques for sensitivity analysis. The investigation has evidenced a time-lag between the moment interventions have been issued and the moment in which their effect has actually taken place changing the pandemic path. Indeed this result seem to reflect a physical mechanism. While shelter-in-place measures are officially established on a given date, it is unlikely that they have an immediate effect. For instance, individuals might not be able to interrupt all contacts immediately, they do not have instantaneous access to masks or other protecting equipment. Moreover, some activities cannot shutdown immediately due to technical reasons, and certain industrial compartments have to remain open to keep delivering essential services to the population. ). The first six bars concern the individual factor effects, the next 15 represent the average magnitudes of the second order effects, the next 20 bars refer to third order effects, etc.. factors relate to social distancing measures. Not only, but combined with the results of the time to intervention analysis, the findings indicate that the earlier intervention measures are introduced, but also the more rapidly (strongly) they can be implemented, the more effective they are in flattening the pandemic curve. From a modeling viewpoint, the strong impact of the intervention time suggests indeed that this variable needs to be taken into account to increase the prediction accuracy of SEIR models. Regarding limitations of the present analysis, further work can be done to determine the distributions of the factors more precisely and, potentially, to include statistical correlations among the factors. Also, the analysis has been focused on the total number of infected individuals at 56 days from the initial observations. However, the analysis can also be made time dependent, varying the final time (e.g., using an analysis at 50 days or at 100 days). Of course, the longer the time horizon, the larger the uncertainty in the forecast we expect. Also, we have chosen one specification of the SEIR models and alternative specifications may be used. The paper moves in the direction advocated by [10] . The uncertainty quantification is directly applicable to other SIER models and/or even to other type of models used to forecast or study the COVID-19 pandemics. Also, while we have analyzed data from Italy, the analysis can be replicated with data coming from other Countries and regions. The approach yields coherent insights not only regarding the most important inputs but also about the role of interactions and direction of change. This enriches the spectrum of insights gained from the model and the data with respect to current practice, with analyses that are limited only to varying one factor at a time. The analysis helps modelers in understanding key-factors of uncertainty increasing transparency. Collecting information on these factors might reduce uncertainty in the forecasts improving modelling efficacy and helping result communications to the public (see the recent critique in [14] ).

98701,"In the first two weeks after declaring the national emergency, the social distancing metrics had changed significantly: more people stayed at home, fewer trips were observed, and travel distance became shorter. However, by the third week of March, the trend of all metrics on social distancing had reached a plateau and remained steadily high for two weeks. We call this phenomenon 'Social Distancing Inertia' (18) . Starting mid-April, the national SDI began to decline. We refer to the phenomenon of shifting from self-restriction to pre-pandemic behavior as ""Quarantine Fatigue"". To check the universality of this increase of physical activities in different states, we have investigated the ROC curve of five day moving average SDI and also the average SDI for the week before and after April 15. Despite the different changes in the confirmed cases per thousand population of each state, we could find a universal decline of SDI for almost all the states in the nation. It shows that people reacted to the nationwide situation of the pandemic not only to the state level conditions. The national quarantine fatigue started around April 15th, before any state had announced reopening policies while the first state to announce reopening was South Carolina by easing restrictions on outdoor and recreation, retail and beauty on April 20th. The universal decline of SDI indicates that on a nationwide level people are going outside more without any states declaring the re-openness. There could be multiple reasons for this phenomenon. One may assume that it is because households must start working on site to pay for the bills and these are essential trips. However, by digging deeper into the data, we could find out more evidence to support the phenomenon of fatigue. After mid-April, the total trips traveled per person increased from 2.75 to 3.0 as seen in figure 3 . Among the 0.25 increase, non-work trips have counted for 80%, changing from 2.3 to 2.5. Therefore, only 20% of the increased trips are work trips and most of the increased travels are non-work trips which don't support the assumption. One may also argue that the fatigue could relate to the upcoming protests over lockdown for states like Michigan (21) . It was true that Michigan residents started the protest on April 15th which coincidentally matched with the start date of the quarantine fatigue nationwide. However, it actually supports our finding that without enforcement, or consistent and effective knowledge propagation of the infectious disease, people tend to get away from the self-isolated voluntary quarantine situation. They would involve themselves in more outdoor activities no matter whether a reopening is announced in the state or not.

The results of the analyses are summarized as follows. For China, which is the first country to have faced a full-blown outbreak of COVID-19, we can observe from social media that people took the situation and prevention seriously. As the number of confirmed cases in China decreased, the trend in social media shifted toward the concern for the global situation. In the UK and the US, the main English-speaking countries, initially, there was less social media interests owing to fewer confirmed cases. The subsequent outbreaks sprung the discussion about COVID-19 on social media, including the promotion of precautionary measures and recommendations to keep ""social distancing"" measures. Meanwhile, Japan showed relatively sluggish growth. However, on March 24, 2020, the announcement of the postponement of the 2020 Olympic Games in Tokyo along with a relatively rapid growth of confirmed cases was reflected in the increased social media activity. This was accompanied by microblogs expressing concerns about the epidemic and dissatisfaction with government measures. We believe that this dataset can be analyzed further in many ways, such as sentiment-based analysis 17 , comparison with web search queries, moving logs 18,19 , etc. Various combinations of data can enable deeper analyses of social media communication.

100024,"We aimed to discover critical insights on the endemic/epidemic/pandemic characteristics of the While TPL-b appears rather stable or even invariant with time and/or space, the population aggregation critical density (PACD) (i.e., M 0 or infection critical threshold), which is the level at which infections are random and below which infections may be stabilized, can depend on disease kinds (COVID-19 or SARS), time (disease or outbreak stages), and space (regions). We postulate that M 0 should also be influenced by public-health interventions such as quarantines and travel restrictions. Therefore, M 0 can be an important epidemiological parameter for evaluating the characteristics of disease outbreaks. For example, COVID-19 exhibited significantly lower threshold (M 0 ) than SARS, suggesting a potentially lower infection ""tolerance"" threshold of COVID-19. Nevertheless, it should be cautioned that the ""tolerance"" threshold only means the level of random infections, which may signal the level of stabilized infections. However, whether or not the ""tolerance"" threshold is biometrically tolerable or safe depends on other biomedical characteristics, among which Allee effects can be a critical factor to determine whether or not the infections will die off or persist. We postulate that if M 0 coincide or is below the level Allee effects in action, the infections may die off. Second, all datasets we tested easily passed the neutrality test with HDP-MSN and indicated that The ratio of Q=M/θ may be used as a measure of the relative importance of ""infection spread via migration"" vs. ""infections spread via local contagion"" in spreading the infections, with larger Q indicating higher migration role and smaller Q indicating higher local contagion. Third, both the TPL scaling law and metapopulation modeling may complement each other. The difference (closeness) between M 0 (the infection critical threshold from TPL) and θ (local contagion or ""speciation"" rate from metapopulation modeling) may signal the effectiveness of completely blocking the migration (dispersal) in spreading infections. For example, in the case of COVID-19 infections in China, both parameters (M 0 and θ) are rather close to each other and their difference is only approximately 0.6, suggesting that, without external inputs, the infections from local contagion is only approximately 0.6 higher than the infection critical threshold (M 0 ). This makes the mission of controlling local contagion for stabilizing infections much less challenging than the mission when θ >> M 0. Finally, we suggest that the approaches demonstrated previously should be of general applicability for epidemiological research. In particular, we consider TPL-b can be a pathogen specific parameter, primarily shaped by evolutionary forces.

100677,"In this study we simulated several possible scenarios of COVID-19 pandemic's spread in Australia. The model, AceMod, was calibrated to known pandemic dynamics, and accounted for age-dependent attack rates, a range of reproductive numbers, age-stratified and social context dependent transmission rates, household clusters and other social mixing contexts, symptomatic-asymptomatic distinction, long and varying incubation periods, and other relevant epidemiological parameters. An important calibration result was the need for age-dependent fractions of symptomatic agents, with the fraction of symptomatic children found to be one-fifth of that of the adults. While other combinations of parameters may also succeed in calibration, setting the age-dependent fractions of symptomatic cases may be important for other modelling studies across the world. An analysis of spatiotemporal characteristics of COVID-19 pandemic in Australia was carried across a range of intervention strategies, some of which are already in place, while some are under discussion. By Case isolation + SD compliance =0.7 Case isolation + SD compliance =0.8 Case isolation + SD compliance =0.9 Figure 6 : Strong compliance with social distancing (at 80% and above) effectively controls the disease during the suppression period, while lower levels of compliance (at 70% or less) do not succeed for any duration of the suppression. A comparison of social distancing strategies, coupled with case isolation, across different compliance levels (70%, 80% and 90%). Duration of each social distancing (SD) strategy is set to 91 days (13 weeks), shown as a shaded area. Case isolation and restrictions on international arrivals are set to last until the end of each scenario. Traces show incidence (a), prevalence (b), cumulative incidence (c), and the growth rate of cumulative incidenceĊ (d). running multiple computer simulations, while varying details of the micro-simulation, we estimates epidemic dynamics, in terms of the infection's prevalence and incidence, its peaks and waves, and other indicators, including age-dependent attack rates. We reported several findings relevant to COVID-19 mitigation and suppression policy setting. The first implication is that the effectiveness of school closures is limited, producing a two-week delay in epidemic peak, without a significant impact on the magnitude of the peak, in terms of incidence or prevalence. The temporal benefit of the two-week delay may be offset not only by logistical complications, but also by some increases in the fractions of both children and older adults during the period around the incidence peak. The second implication is related to social distancing (SD) strategy, which showed no benefit for lower levels of compliance (at 70% or less) -these levels do not contribute to epidemic control for any duration of the social distancing restrictions. Only when the SD compliance levels exceed 80%, there is a reduction in incidence and prevalence. Our modelling results indicate existence of an actionable transition across these strategies in the range between 70% and 80%. In other words, increasing a compliance level just by 10%, from 70% to 80%, may effectively control the spread of COVID-19 in Australia (during the suppression period). We also reported a trade-off between the compliance levels and the duration of SD mitigation, with 90% compliance significantly reducing incidence and prevalence after a shorter period of 91 days (13 weeks). Although a resurgence of the disease is possible once these interventions cease, we believe that this study could facilitate a timely planning of effective intervention strategies. Future research will address several limitations of our study, including a more fine-grained implementation of natural history of the disease, incorporation of more recent ABS data from 2020, inclusion of home quarantine strategy for the affected households, as well as a more refined school closures strategy. We also hope to trace specific spatial pathways and patterns of epidemics, in order to enable a detailed understanding of how the infection spreads in diverse circumstances and localities, with the aim to identify the best ways to locate and curtail the pandemic spread in Australia 2 . Other avenues lead to analysis of precursors and critical thresholds for possible emergence of new strains [41, 42, 43] , given genomic surveillance data interpreted as complex networks [44, 45, 46, 47, 48] , dynamic models of social behaviour in times of health crises [49, 16, 50, 51] , and analysis of global socioeconomic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic [52, 53] .

101689,"This paper proposes a dynamic SIR model to estimate the impact of various NPIs on the COVID-19 transmission using panel data from 9 countries across the globe. Data from these countries show significant variations in their selections and timelines of the NPIs. Our findings suggest that centralized quarantine is the most effective NPI measure, followed by lockdown, school closure and wearing masks. The scenario analysis shows that lockdown might be cautiously lifted if the country using the other three NPIs simultaneously (school closure, wearing masks and centralized quarantine). Our findings provide feasible solutions for countries to use economically affordable NPIs such as mask wearing and centralized quarantine to replace the highly economically costly NPIs such as national lockdown, without significantly heightening the epidemic peak and can substantially flatten the curve of the active COVID-19 cases to reach a non-epidemic regime. This paper also suggests each country should customize its choice of NPIs by considering specific socioeconomic situations within the country. In particular, our empirical findings suggest that, as of April 4th, Singapore and the U.S. might consider imposing stricter NPIs, while European countries may cautiously consider to gradually lift the policies after reaching the turning points in a few days. We are aware that there are likely undetected cases in the population, for instance because the testing capacity is limited and individual has no symptoms, which may cause potential issues such as the second-wave of the epidemic after the control policy is lifted. It is possible to calibrate such effect by ongoing random testing of the population in the SIR framework [47] . To conclude, the DP-SIR model used with panel data can provide useful insights for countries to choose the most appropriate NPIs in a timely manner to balance the desired goals between the economy performance and health consequence.

102212,"Given the international network of public transportation, the epidemic growth in a given city or country may be triggered by external agents that arrive from an infected region. This first stage is not universal. After that, local governmental policies such as quarantine ones are taken in order to mitigate the epidemic growth. We presented a minimal model were all these components are taken into account, being defined by parameters that can be deduced from public information and fitting of the available reported data. The first stage, that is the importation of external cases plus the beginning of local contagions, was modeled by a linear dynamics [Eq. (1) ]. The proposed solution [Eq. (6) ] is able to fit different sub, super, as well as standard exponential behaviors. The quarantine period was modelled by splitting the total number of infected in active and inactive (recovered and dead) [Eq. (7)], which dynamics can be read as a linearization of a SIR like model [Eqs. (9) and (10)]. The model was applied to the COVID-19 pandemic, analyzing reported data in different countries. For European countries such as Italy, Spain, France, and UK, the model provides a very good fitting of the available data. In addition, estimations for the corresponding epidemic peaks were obtained. Similarly to the case of Argentina, these countries established quarantine as a rigorous national policy. While in the pre-quarantine period a universal behavior is not observed, this is the case in the post-quarantine stage, where independently of the country the epidemic can be fitted with the same complexity parameter. These features support the splitting introduced in our model, as well as the estimations obtained from it. The present approach also allows to analyze possible quarantine softening scenarios. The dynamics remains the same, being defined with a modified rate that depends on a factor that is proportional to the fraction of the total population under quarantine. The formalism furnishes roughly estimations for the changes in the epidemic peak and saturation values. Thus, we conclude that the present contribution may provide a valuable tool for taking relevant decisions about epidemic control. In particular, it allows to obtain qualitative estimations of the degree of quarantine softening in order to avoid a posterior collapse of a given health system.

102614,"We introduce a new probabilistic model to estimate the real spread of the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus along regions or countries. Our model simulates the behavior of each individual in a population according to a probabilistic model through an inverse problem; we estimate the real number of recovered and infected people using mortality records. In addition, the model is dynamic in the sense that it takes into account the policy measures introduced when we solve the inverse problem. The results obtained in Spain have particular practical relevance: the number of infected individuals can be $17$ times higher than the data provided by the Spanish government on April $26$ $th$ in the worst-case scenario. Assuming that the number of fatalities reflected in the statistics is correct, $9.8$ percent of the population may be contaminated or have already been recovered from the virus in Madrid, one of the most affected regions in Spain. However, if we assume that the number of fatalities is twice as high as the official numbers, the number of infections could have reached $19.5\%$. In Galicia, one of the regions where the effect has been the least, the number of infections does not reach $2.5 \%$ . Based on our findings, we can: i) estimate the risk of a new outbreak before Autumn if we lift the quarantine; ii) may know the degree of immunization of the population in each region; and iii) forecast or simulate the effect of the policies to be introduced in the future based on the number of infected or recovered individuals in the population.","We introduce a new probabilistic model to estimate the real spread of the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus along regions or countries.<q>8$ percent of the population may be contaminated or have already been recovered from the virus in Madrid, one of the most affected regions in Spain.<q>The results obtained in Spain have particular practical relevance: the number of infected individuals can be $17$ times higher than the data provided by the Spanish government on April $26$ $th$ in the worst-case scenario.

103009,"The key conclusions from this kind of modelling are twofold. First, the notion of a flareup or rebound of infections is not supported by the evidence at hand. A popular conception of this rebound is akin to lowering the 'flood gates' too soon and being overwhelmed with a deluge of infections. However, this picture may be a false impression. If immunity lasts on the order of months, then there can be no flood because a sufficient proportion of the population have already been exposed to the virus. These people preclude a rapid spread of the virus through the population by acting as a retardant or buffer that suppresses the effective reproduction ratio. In other words, the first wave cannot flareup because it may have exhausted the substrate of susceptible individuals it needs to disseminate itself. This speaks to the second key conclusion. Over the forthcoming months it is likely that any 'flood' will be more of a 'trickle'. In this limited window of opportunity, FTTI protocols become viable, in the sense that detecting asymptomatic and infected individuals with a reasonable (e.g., 25%) efficacy would be sufficient to delay the re-emergence of the virus-a re-emergence that rests on, and only on, a slow loss of immunity. In short, FTTI will work after the first wave, even if it was not logistically viable before the first wave: if we lose collective immunity over a period of many months or years, then a second wave can be deferred or eluded, via FTTI, saving thousands of lives. This is under the proviso that a second wave can be pushed sufficiently far into the future, where it is rendered innocuous by vaccination or other interventions. Clearly, this narrative depends on the acquisition of (herd) immunity following the first wave and its subsequent loss due to population fluxes, geo-social, and serological factors. The big question at the moment is whether the first wave has induced a sufficient level of herd immunity to open the window of opportunity for tracking and tracing. Although there are no current data for the UK, early studies in Germany speak directly to this issue. Figure 12 reproduces the hidden states in Figure 10 , with a focus on infection status. The prevalence of immunity is shown as a yellow line. At the peak of the first wave (shortly after 60 days) the inferred level of immunity is 15%. This is the level of immunity estimated empirically in provisional reports of a serological study of people living in a region near Bonn (Streeck et al., 2020) 17 . Results of this sort are encouraging and endorse the inferences afforded by dynamic causal modelling. Perhaps more importantly, over the next few weeks more serological studies will become available 18 and we will know with greater certainty whether the above narrative is licensed by empirical data. If not, these data can be assimilated into the model to update our (Bayesian) beliefs about what has happened, what will happen and what could happen.

103144,"Alternating-lock-downs offer a sustainable strategy to overcome COVID-19. It allows to continue the socio-economic activity at a 50% rate, while mitigating the spread. We designed our strategy under the assumption of imperfect social compliance [11] , allowing a defection fraction of f . We believe, however, that the weekly relief, allowing people an outlet to continue and be active half of the time, may, itself, increase cooperation levels. Indeed, while a complete lock-down is extremely stressful for the individual, the bi-weekly routine offered here relaxes the burden, and may encourage compliance. This also provides a degree of freedom to allow a certain level of authorized defection, i.e. a quota of essential workers that can be relived from the lock-down periods. In practice, we believe that the simplest implementation can be by regulating schools and workplaces. Each house-hold will be informed on its lock-down/active schedule, and in parallel workplaces and schools will only be allowed to operate in weekly fully partitioned shifts. Under such regulations the strategy has little dependence on social cooperation, as schools and employment will naturally drive the population between activity and inactivity. The only enforcement of the lock-down that will still be required is for recreational activities, beyond school and work. We believe that the pressure to defect for such activities is lower, and hence overall defection levels can be sustained well within the bounds of successful mitigation. Our analysis assumes an incubation period that is of the order of a single week, specifically in our simulations, we set it at an average of 5 days. The rationale however is more general, and can be adapted to longer or shorter incubation times, simply by tuning the periodicity of the lock-down shifts, keeping them congruent with the natural cycle of the disease. More broadly, we consider the fact that there is, inherently, some level of uncertainty regarding the disease parameters. We therefore assumed a worst case scenario, in which the infection rate during the active weeks is the same as that of the unmitigated spread. In practice, however, we expect many additional measures to be implemented in parallel to the lock-downs, such as extended testing for infections, and strict hygienic regulations at the workplace. At the least, we expect standard prophylactic behavior, such as avoiding contact or banning social gatherings, to be observed also during each group's active week. Such norms, that will continue until COVID-19 is fully mitigated, will further push down β, enhancing the effectiveness of our strategy even under higher f or σ. Alternating lock-downs offers an additional crucial advantage, that, again -assuming worst case -we did not exploit in our simulations. Indeed, the fact that at each time point only half of the population is active, is, itself, an enhancer of prophylactic norms. With classrooms, public transport, offices and marketplaces at only half capacity, it becomes more natural to maintain social distancing, and reduce infectious interactions. Hence, our partition will further push down the infection rate β, likely leading to an even better performance than reported in Fig. 2 . Our simulation results are based on a simplistic SEIR model, potentially overlooking much of the complexity and irregularity characterizing the spread in a real social setting. Moreover, while our modeling covers the epidemiological aspects of the strategy, it cannot advise on its practical implementation or on its economical viability. Finally, tested against real-time data of, e.g., human mobility, will enable further fine-tuning of the proposed strategy. For example, partitioning into more groups, if possible, allowing extended activity periods, or changing the schedule from weekly to, e.g., 10 days, etc. • Therefore, we do not call for the immediate implementation of alternating lock-downs. We do, however, think that the potential merits of this scheme warrant its consideration as a leading strategy for mitigation of COVID-19. As we communicate this idea -we invite critique, and further examination of its applicability, and especially, call for testing it against real-time human interaction data, to fine-tune its implementation and assess its effectiveness. Data availability. All codes to reproduce, examine and improve our proposed analysis are available at . f under different intervention times t 0 (blue -red gradient). We observe a transition, in which for f < 0.17 the disease is eliminated. Beyond this defection rate, spread is suppressed, but not fully eliminated, i.e. flattened.

For large f , however, the overall duration is increased -an inevitable price of flattening the curve. (h) -(j) We measured the three parameters vs. the variability in incubation times σ.

103353,"In this study, a realistic Trans-SEIR model is presented for understanding the spread of infectious disease in urban areas considering the spatial-varying mobility dynamics and the presence of both travel contagions and activity contagions. The Trans-SEIR model starts with the dynamic system to capture the population movement among different zones and derive the equilibrium flow pattern for the urban areas. Based on the stable commuting pattern, the spread of infectious disease in urban areas is formulated as a spatial SEIR system with travel contagion, and an entrance control framework for urban transportation is further proposed for the optimal allocation of limited resources for reducing the risks from the infectious diseases. The presented modeling approach along with the optimal control framework will allow for advances in understanding the disease dynamics in urban areas and contribute to the framing controlling strategies and policies for mitigating the risk of infectious diseases from the urban transportation perspective.

104018,"In this paper, we studied Twitter communications in the United States during the early days of the COVID-19 outbreak. As the disease continued to spread, we observed that calls for closures of schools, bars, cities and entire states as well as social distancing and quarantining quickly gained fervor. Alongside, we observed an increase in panic buying and lack of availability of essential items, in particular toilet paper. We also conducted a linguistic word-usage analysis and distinguished between words that are common to multiple hashtag groups and words that uniquely and semantically identify each hashtag group. In addition to words that represent the group, our analysis unearths many words related to emotion in the tweets. Also, our qualitative analysis reveals that the words are used in multiple different contexts, which is worth delving further into. The research presented in this paper is preliminary and its primary aim is to quantitatively outline the socio-economic distress already caused by COVID-19 so that we as a society can learn from this experience and be better prepared if COVID-19 (or maybe another pandemic) were to (re)emerge in the future. At the time of writing this paper, the infection spread has still not reached its peak in the United States. Therefore, we plan to keep collecting data to understand and investigate the socio-economic and political impact of COVID-19. We plan to expand on our current research by performing topic modeling and expanding our linguistic analysis to unearth the main topics being discussed in the tweets.

104325,"Motivated by the need for novel robust approaches to modelling the Covid-19 epidemic, this paper treats a population of $N$ individuals as an inhomogeneous random social network (IRSN). The nodes of the network represent different types of individuals and the edges represent significant social relationships. An epidemic is pictured as a contagion process that changes daily, triggered on day $0$ by a seed infection introduced into the population. Individuals' social behaviour and health status are assumed to be random, with probability distributions that vary with their type. First a formulation and analysis is given for the basic SI (""susceptible-infective"") network contagion model, which focusses on the cumulative number of people that have been infected. The main result is an analytical formula valid in the large $N$ limit for the state of the system on day $t$ in terms of the initial conditions. The formula involves only one-dimensional integration. Next, more realistic SIR and SEIR network models, including""removed""(R) and""exposed""(E) classes, are formulated. These models also lead to analytical formulas that generalize the results for the SI network model. The framework can be easily adapted for analysis of different kinds of public health interventions, including vaccination, social distancing and quarantine. The formulas can be implemented numerically by an algorithm that efficiently incorporates the fast Fourier transform. Finally a number of open questions and avenues of investigation are suggested, such as the framework's relation to ordinary differential equation SIR models and agent based contagion models that are more commonly used in real world epidemic modelling.","Motivated by the need for novel robust approaches to modelling the Covid-19 epidemic, this paper treats a population of $N$ individuals as an inhomogeneous random social network (IRSN).<q>The nodes of the network represent different types of individuals and the edges represent significant social relationships.<q>An epidemic is pictured as a contagion process that changes daily, triggered on day $0$ by a seed infection introduced into the population.

104786,"The simulations conducted were aimed to measure three items: • The effectiveness of quarantine • The effect of a gradual return to work over an immediate return to work • The effect of a sudden panic buying period when quarantine announcements are made The model helped reinforce some of our predictions of the effectiveness of quarantine in the Tri-state area. First, instituting a quarantine lowered the total number of cases within the population. This is apparent by comparing the number of ""Recovered"" people in Figures 8 and 9 (with quarantine) with Figure 7 (no quarantine). Furthermore, our models show the amount of people working during quarantine plays a large role in the spread of the virus and the effects of a second wave. Comparing Figure 8a with 8b or Figure 9a with 9b, illustrates these trends. The runs where 50% of the population working during quarantine (Figure 8a and 9a) , have a much higher number of people infected at the peak when compared to the runs when only 10% of the population worked (Figure 8b and 9b) . It can be seen from the plots that when a large percentage of the population gets the virus during the first wave, there is little or no second wave. On the other hand, when quarantine is taken more seriously, with only 10% of the population continuing to work, the wave lasts much longer, and the population is more susceptible to a second wave. It is important to realize that the runs with 10% and 50% of the population had similar numbers of ""removed"" people at the end of the run. This shows the effectiveness of a quarantine at reducing the strain on the health system by lowering the maximum number of infections at the peak of the wave. Additionally, it shows that to lower the overall number of people infected, a strict quarantine would need to be instituted and held until there were no infectious cases remaining in the population. However, it can also be clearly seen by comparing our quarantine runs to our run without quarantine (Figure 7 ) that any amount of quarantine or social distancing reduces the number of infections. Studying the gradual versus immediate return to work, turned out to be the most challenging aspect of our project. Due to the methodology used to calculate a person's individual likelihood of becoming infected (Equation 1), a given person has a higher probability of becoming infected when they are at the same location as an infected person and there are only a few people there vs when it is a crowded. As a result, when our model slowly starts reintroducing people to the workplace the number of employees at each location is rather small. This meant that our model predicted that a gradual return to work would yield a slightly higher second wave then an immediate return to work. This can be seen when comparing Figure 10a with Figure 10b . Furthermore, a gradual return to work resulted in more people having contracted the virus overall. This result seemed counter-intuitive so making changes to the model to account for workplaces implementing PPE and social distancing may be needed. The model's analysis of a ""panic"" induced by the announcement of quarantine ended up being quite interesting. Figure 11 measures the effect of a sudden panic buying period compared with no panic. The three-day panic period results in more overall Covid-19 cases, due to the increased number of people being exposed to potentially infectious people while at grocery stores and supermarkets. When this increased number of infected was scaled to the full size of the Cincinnati Tri-State area, the model predicted approximately 30,000 extra cases due to the panic of the quarantine announcement. ","The simulations conducted were aimed to measure three items: • The effectiveness of quarantine • The effect of a gradual return to work over an immediate return to work • The effect of a sudden panic buying period when quarantine announcements are made The model helped reinforce some of our predictions of the effectiveness of quarantine in the Tri-state area.<q>First, instituting a quarantine lowered the total number of cases within the population.<q>Comparing Figure 8a with 8b or Figure 9a with 9b, illustrates these trends.

104847,"There are a number of aspects worth mentioning: • Individuals i ∈ I τ /P τ who don't know whom they've been infected by are not removed. This is a clear incentive for adopting apps at individual level. We assume that individuals who don't know whom they are infected by, are infected by individuals that do not belong to the population of detected positives. • We assume that if i knows that he/she was infected by j then j knows, at the time of being tested positive, that he/she had a contact with i. This may not be true based on questionnaire, but it is reasonable if apps for contact tracing are adopted. • The set Q τ only includes positives in quarantine. It does not include those who got in contact with a positive case, but who were not infected. So the set of quarantined people should be much larger. Ten times the number of positives may be a a conservative measure. • The reverse epidemics approach relies on parameters of the infection dynamics (the distributions of T i and L i ) that have been estimated empirically [7, 5] . In particular, the approach is independent of the infection rate, percentage of asymptomatic cases and other parameters that make predictions on the basis of forward epidemiological models very unstable. • Effects of preventive quarantine are weak in the first week (see Fig. 1 ) due to the lags related to incubation period and detection. A significant effect is apparent by the end of the second week. The full effect sets in after the third week. • The effects of preventive quarantine depend strongly on p, the efficiency with which contacts are monitored. An efficiency p = 0.8 in tracing contacts, that according to a recent study should be achievable by interviewing positive cases [4] , can reduce the size of the epidemics by 60%. An efficiency of 95%, such as that reported by Wang at al. [7] for Wuhan, can reduce almost to 10% of what they would have been. If mobile apps will be adopted the level of compliance of users will be critical to ensure that preventive quarantine is effective. • Our analysis permits us to estimate the effects of preventive quarantine on the tested positive population in a counterfactual scenario. In reality, preventive quarantine would also isolate many infected individuals who would not go on to develop symptoms (and hence would be unlikely to be tested) but who would contribute to further spread the disease. The isolation of non-tested individuals would contribute, in the most optimistic scenario, to a reduction of basic reproductive number of a factor 1 − p 2 , if all the contacts between people that know who they were infected by are eliminated. This optimistic reduction of the basic reproductive number would correspond to an exponential decrease of the ratio between new cases with and without preventive quarantine. The protective potential of preventive quarantine might be therefore between this latter optimistic scenario and the more pessimistic one that we discussed in this paper and illustrated in Figure 4 . The reverse epidemiology approach bears similarity with the reconstruction of phylogeny from generic data (see e.g. [3] ) and the counterfactual analysis of disruption events in other complex systems (see e.g. [6] ). We are not aware of any such approach to the study of epidemic outbreaks, which we believe is a very promising one.

104891,"Since 24 January 2020, all public transportation in and out of Wuhan was restricted, effectively locking down a city of about 11 million people. Starting 9 February 2020, every building in urban areas and every village in rural area was quarantined in Wuhan to contain the spread of CoVID. In addition to this, unprecedented efforts were employed by the Chinese government to prevent human to human contact between susceptible and infected individuals. At the same time, the data for the infected case count in Wuhan was seen to enter a stagnation phase about 30 days post 24 January 2020, when quarantine measures were deployed in Wuhan. In this study, we show that the classical SIER and the SIR models in which the model parameters, i.e. the transmission rate β, the infection rate σ and the recovery rate γ are assumed to be constant are not able to recover the stagnation observed in the infected case count in Wuhan. This suggests that the classical epidemiological models need to be revisited by including a time varying term which encapsulates the strict public health quarantine and isolation measures implemented in Wuhan, China post 24 January 2020. By approximating this time varying quarantine strength with a neural network, we train the governing system of augmented SIR differential equations based on a loss function term obtained from the infected and recovered case count data generated by the Chinese National Health Commission. By training this governing system, we are able to not only approximate the maximum plateau value seen in the infected case count 30 days post the implementation of quarantine control, but also recover a monotonically increasing quarantine strength function; indicating the increasing severity of quarantine measures with time. At the peak of its quarantine measures, we predict that about 70% of the infected population was effectively isolated and prevented from spreading infection to the non-infected population. From the model, we can also recover the effective reproduction number, R(t) from the model which is seen to decrease from R(t) ≈ 1.5 to R(t) < 1 a month post 24 January 2020, indicating the efficacy of quarantine and isolation measures in curtailing the spread of CoVID in Wuhan. We then used an optimized neural network-augmented SIR model to forecast the quarantine control strength and effective reproduction number in Wuhan. Our model predicts a stagnation of the quarantine strength function, Q(t) as China eases the strength of quarantine and isolation measures in Wuhan. Due to a stagnation of the quarantine strength function, a stagnation in the effective reproduction number at R(t) < 1 is estimated from end of March 2020. However, our results also include a warning that, although the infected case count in Wuhan is stagnating, this does not imply that quarantine measures in Wuhan should be relaxed immediately. Since quarantined and isolated individuals may not have completely recovered, relaxing the quarantine measures may lead to a relapse in the infection spread and a subsequent increase in the effective reproduction number to R(t) > 1. Thus, it may be wise to not relax quarantine measures after sufficient time has elapsed, during which maximum of the quarantined/isolated people are recovered. Finally, it should be noted that our model has a number of limitations. We do not consider the cases when the quarantined/isolated population come into contact with the non-infected population and lead to the transmission of disease. Although it has become evident that CoVID transmission also occurs through asymptomatic individuals, we do not make a distinction between symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals in our model. Irrespective of these assumptions, we believe this to be a first study to quantify the effective of quarantine measures implemented in Wuhan, with an interpretable physical model aided by machine learning techniques, involving very few free parameters.

105130,"Mathematical modeling can provide tools to better understand epidemic dynamics and can vary from purely theoretical to more data driven and predictive [26] . While a simple model such as this one should not be used to make large-scale policy recommendations, it can provide a framework for specific hypothesis testing. Also, our model may be applicable to social networks of smaller size exhibiting small world characteristics, such as seen in college settings [32] . Here we use the model to ask several specific questions about how different behaviors might impact population infection rates. We specifically examine three main actions that can be taken to curb the SARS-CoV-2 spread: 1) government imposed social distancing; 2) behaviorally induced social isolation following virus exposure and 3) infection rate reduction, e.g. through behavioral adaptation through PPE or increased hand-washing and disinfecting. Early in the pandemic, government imposed social distancing was the primary tool used to slow infection rates or as commonly described ""flatten the curve"" [1] . Actions taken are quite varied and there is generally no uniform agreement about how much social distancing is necessary to significantly slow SARS-CoV-2 transmission. To examine the full potential for social distancing we examine a wide range of possible scenarios varying from no official social distancing to extreme social distancing (90%). While the two extreme scenarios are easy to envision (zero social distancing is business as usual and 90% is all but non-essential businesses closed), more moderate social distancing scenarios are harder to translate into direct societal actions. Nevertheless, we find a clear phase transition with social distancing in our small-world models. In general, social distancing compliance below 65% results in a wide-spread outbreak, while social distancing compliance above 75% contains the virus to low levels. For our secondary simulations over a refined parameter space, in the absence of stringent individual social distancing responses we observe that there is a phase transition that occurs as the percentage of agents socially distancing changes from 73% to 74%. While it is difficult to relate these transitions to specific policies that may be put in place, it is apparent that aggressive social distancing policies are required to contain an outbreak. Moreover, social distancing measures that allow for more inter-agent contact will likely allow rampant viral spread. In addition to government actions, individual behavior taken during the pandemic can greatly affect the dynamics of the pandemic. Most governments have issued guidelines for social isolation if in contact with a diseased individual. The most commonly recommended guideline is 14 days of self-isolation to avoid exposing other individuals [6, 8, 10] . However, despite these official guidelines, self-isolation following exposure requires that infected individuals inform their contacts and that exposed individuals voluntary comply. Given these caveats, we wanted to understand how self-isolation following an infected symptomatic social contact would influence final disease progression. In this model, self-imposed social distancing occurs only on the days when the agent has sufficiently many symptomatic contacts in the network. Thus, our model incorporates self-imposed social distancing as highly responsive to an agent's short-term perceptions regarding infection risks within their community. Interestingly, for self-isolation to negatively impact the number of infections, an extreme level of responsiveness was needed by the agents involved. In our model, it was necessary for self-isolation to occur following exposure to only one infected agent. If self-isolation occurred following the symptomatic infection of two or more contacts, the effect on viral spread was minimal. Given the high number of asymptomatic infected people with SARS-CoV-2 [15, 27] , it is likely that many individuals who have come in contact with an infected individual are not aware of their exposure. Our findings also highlight the well-known fact that contact tracing following an individual's positive test is critical for limiting the spread of the infection [4] . Individuals responsiveness to recommended government actions are highly variable [6] . One control measure to decrease the virus spread is wearing a mask in public [21] . While this behavior is widely adopted in Asian countries that had experience with prior epidemics, it was much slower to catch on in Western  Fig 7. Social Distance Probability and Viral Shedding. Social distance probability vs. viral shedding, with social distance threshold and length of epidemic indicated by color and size. Longer outbreaks occur with low social distance probability and high viral shedding rates. countries [21, 28] . Mask wearing can significantly reduce viral shedding since individuals wearing a mask have a reduced chance of passing the virus on to others. Yet this policy remains controversial and adoption of mask wearing has been highly variable [30, 31] . Mask wearing in our model is captured by viral shedding. In our model, if the viral shedding rate is very small, then the epidemic does not spread, With moderate rate of viral shedding, the social distance threshold at which someone decides to self-isolate after coming into contact with an infected individual becomes much more important. In our model, if the social distance threshold is set to 1 (agents self-isolate after coming into contact with at least one infected agent), then the final total infection rate in the population is approximately 12%. However, if the behaviorally induced social distancing does not take place or takes place at a higher threshold, then the final infection is much larger with the overall infection rate in the population approximately 62%. Finally, when the viral shedding in our model was set at a high level of 25% (simulating a comparatively more infectious disease), the government imposed social distancing was required to be greater than 80% to control the outbreak, resulting in an approximately 1% infection rate in the population. Other less stringent social distancing conditions result in a viral infection rate between 25% and 97.5%. Although not prescriptive, the analysis of our simple agent-based model on synthetic networks provides strong evidence for generalizations. Social distancing controls in this model exhibit a sharp phase transition regarding total number of infections, either when imposed at a large scale by government mandates or when based on individual response to infected contacts. Our models suggest that in order to be effective, mandatory social distancing such as stay-at-home orders need to be broadly applied across all segments of society with a high degree of adherence by individuals. Alternatively, self-isolation must be immediately enacted if a social contact is known to be infected. Finally, if it is possible to reduce viral shedding through adherence to mask wearing, then the size of the final infected population can be significantly reduced. Supporting information S1 File.

In PPMF, we consider minimal data collection and provide a temporary RUERC in encrypted form for storing in user devices. The ARC is responsible for tracing positive cases in public places and sending alerts to nearby people without revealing the user's identity. The SUDUN uploads data to the central database about infected and suspected cases that can be processed to identify a super spreader and visualize the clusters of cases based on postal codes and age groups. Minimal and undetectable data collection, user control, and system transparency are essential factors to ensure user data privacy. Privacy dashboard-based on compliance and user consent makes it convenient and encourages citizens to use such a user-friendly e-government framework. Therefore, using the structure of our proposed PPMF framework, governments can continue their economic activities while tracing and minimizing the mass-level community transmission. In the future, we plan to develop a super spreader detection model and clustering methodology of infected cases, based on our framework.

To that end, we provide a fundamental background of social distancing including basic concepts, measurements, models and propose practical scenarios. We then discuss enabling wireless technologies which are especially effective and can be widely adopted in practice to keep distance and monitor people. After that, emerging technologies such as machine learning, computer vision, thermal, ultrasound, etc., are introduced. These technologies open many new solutions and directions to deal with problems in social distancing, e.g., symptom prediction, detection and monitoring quarantined people, and contact tracing.

106490,"In this paper, we introduced a version of SIR model for infection spreading with known incubation period. This model was applied to analyze the COVID-19 epidemic data in Armenia. We constructed the simplest version of population dynamics of age-structured population. Close work has been done in [13] , which is related to SIR model. In [13] , a temporal kernel F (t) has been introduced that modulates the infectivity of each infected individual. Compared to such model, we introduced the distribution of infected population at given moment of time via an age of infection, instead of looking just long history of focus populations. In other works related to the population dynamics of age-structured population, the differential equations with time delay usually have been considered. Instead, we use integro-differential system of equations, which seems to be an adequate approach to the current situation with COVID-19 epidemic. From our perspective, the proposed approach significantly changes the epidemiological picture (compare to classical SIR models), since the virus is active for about two weeks. Next, we introduced two functions: f (x), which describes the distribution of infectivity by age, and g(x), which describes the content measures. In the normal SIR model, we have two parameters for the rate of infection and the removal of infections. In our integrodifferential model, mapping to elementary processes is straightforward: we just need the velocity parameter a and two periods: the incubation period L and recovery period T with symptoms after the carrier is separated from society. We derive an analytical result for exponential growth in the early stages of epidemics, as well as for the epidemic threshold. It will be very interesting to investigate the transitional situation near the threshold. We suggest simply making numbers and choosing a parameter value to match the correct exponential growth. We applied our model to understand the situation with epidemics in Armenia. What is advantageous in our model, that we can clearly separate two aspects of the epidemic: contact strength (through coefficient A) and deterrence measures through parameter g. We check that in fact we need to make minimal efforts to stop the epidemics, and testing is much cheaper during quarantine. Currently, if we detect only 3.5% of the infected population per day, strictly monitoring the symptoms, we can stop the epidemic. This is much more complicated without quarantine.

107581,"Non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) such as quarantine, self-isolation, social distancing, and virus-contact tracing can greatly reduce the spread of the virus during a pandemic. In the wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, many countries have implemented various NPIs for infection control and mitigation. However, the stringency of the NPIs and the resulting impact among different countries remain unclear due to the lack of quantitative factors. In this study we took a further step to incorporate the effect of the NPIs into the pandemic dynamics model using the concept of policy intensity factor (PIF). This idea enables us to characterize the transition rates as time varying quantities instead of constant values, and thus capturing the dynamical behavior of the basic reproduction number variation in the pandemic. By leveraging a great amount of data reported by the governments and the World Health Organization, we projected the dynamics of the pandemic for the major economies in the world, including the numbers of infected, susceptible, and recovered cases, as well as the pandemic durations. It is observed that the proposed variable-rate susceptible-exposed-infected-recovered (VR-SEIR) model fits and projects the pandemic dynamics very well. We further showed that the resulting PIFs correlate with the stringency of NPIs, which allows us to project the final affected numbers of people in those countries when their current NPIs have been imposed for 90, 180, 360 days. It provides a quantitative insight into the effectiveness of the implemented NPIs, and sheds a new light on minimizing both affected people from COVID-19 and the economic impact.","Non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) such as quarantine, self-isolation, social distancing, and virus-contact tracing can greatly reduce the spread of the virus during a pandemic.<q>In the wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, many countries have implemented various NPIs for infection control and mitigation.<q>However, the stringency of the NPIs and the resulting impact among different countries remain unclear due to the lack of quantitative factors.

108199,"The earlier the lockdown starts, the better it is for any community. With the delay in the number of days to initiate lockdown, time for the disease to slow down will increase in the absence of any specific treatment to COVID-19. Before any country enters stage III of the epidemic, in absence of vaccination or any specific treatment, complete quarantine will be able to contain the disease from spreading further. Our work suggests that if people are Figure 3 : For India, the TEST or required lockdown period is 24 days but the estimated TTE is around 593 days. India is likely to have another wave of infection after around a year but that will be unable to create a pandemic as in the current situation. quarantined in small groups presented by country-specific CCS, the disease will become extinct after the corresponding expected TTE. But it becomes almost extinct after around TEST. So lockdown should to be taken very seriously to fight against the pandemic. This paper provides evidence of the fact that even after the lockdown phase, multiple waves of the disease will re-occur but it will not create pandemic situation. In the present situation where contact tracing of the infected has attracted worldwide attention to trace down the exposed individuals, we suggest to quarantine them in groups as small as country-specific CCS, so that after 15 − 30 days (as specified for each country) the disease would become almost extinct unless any infection is re-introduced from outside. There could be some mathematical limitations due to some approximations in the calculation of CCS and expected TTE of the disease. But the approximations are inevitable and do not affect much the actual CCS or TTE as reflected from our numerical evaluation. Another undeniable consequence of the current pandemic is the great negative impact on the economy. This is further magnified due to almost paralysed transactions in many sectors due to lockdown. Moreover, there is a fear among the general population that if any infection pops up, it might create another round of spread of the disease. This fear, which is not completely unrealistic, may extend the lockdown further. However, after the scheduled lockdown period, if any individual gets infected and a few others get exposed to that person, we need to check whether the total number of such individuals is less than the CCS. If so, this group needs to be quarantined and the rest of the population would be free from immediate danger. However, if the exposed group is larger than the CCS, we recommend to split them in subgroups, each of size at most CCS and quarantine them separately. However, careful and detail surveillance is required to trace all such exposed and infected individuals. Moreover, this localised lockdown or quarantine would help flowing the daily life and might prevent, at least to some extent, the economy from being further weak. CCS has another implication in allocation and arrangement of hospital beds in the quarantine/hospital facilities. If the CCS is 30 (say), a block of 30 or less number of beds should arranged so that total movement within this block, including patients and healthcare people should not exceed that number. Otherwise if one big room accommodates a large number of patients, secondary infection may start spreading. Our model is capable of estimating the average number of testing kits and hospitalisations required in advance to some extent, depending on the available data. However, lockdown in its truest sense may not be feasible in a vast and diverse country like India. So targeted or focused lockdown of selected high risk population might be a cost effective option compared to a generalised lockdown. This would mean saturating screening for cases and identifying the critical number of contacts. So the take away message in the middle of the COVID-19 pandemic is that till the end of expected TTE (country-specific) of the disease we have to be careful. With further onset of COVID-19 symptoms in the future, we should follow quarantine rules strictly. Like any other epidemic, COVID-19 has the tendency to recur but it will not create any alarming pandemic in the future provided we keep a vigilant eye on our hygiene and have vaccination and treatment in the future.

108297,"This study delved into the massive information flow of Italian social media users in reaction to the declaration of the pandemic status of COVID-19 by WHO, and the announcement of the nationwide lockdown by the Italian Government in the first half of March 2020. We explored the emotional profiles of Italians during this period by analysing the social discourse around the official lockdown hashtag promoted by the Italian Government (#iorestoacasa), together with a most trending hashtag of social protest (#sciacalli), and a general hashtag about the lockdown (#italylockdown). The fundamental premise of this work is that social media opens a window on the minds of millions of people [17] . Monitoring social discourse on online platforms provides unprecedented opportunities for understanding how different categories of people react to real world events [9, 12, 15] . Given the massive attention devoted to the COVID-19 pandemic by social media, monitoring online discourse can offer an insightful thermometer of how individuals discussed and perceived the pandemic and the subsequent lockdown. Our MERCURIAL framework offered quantitative readings of the emotional profiles among Italian twitter users during early COVID-19 diffusion. The detected emotional signals of political and social denounce, the trust in local authorities, the fear and anger towards the health and economic repercussions, and the positive initiatives of fraternity, all outline a rich picture of emotional reactions from Italians. Importantly, the psychological interpretation of MERCURIAL's results identified early signals of mental health distress and antisocial behaviour, both linked to violence and relevant for explaining increments in domestic abuse. Future research will further explore and consolidate the behavioural implications of online cognitive and emotional profiles, relying on the promising significance of our current results. Our cognitive network science approach offers decision-makers the prospect of being able to successfully detect global issues and design timely, data-informed policies. Especially under a crisis, when time constraints and pressure prevent even the richest and most organised governments from fully understanding the implications of their choices, an ethical and accurate monitoring of online discourses and emotional profiles constitutes an incredibly powerful support for facing global threats.

108671,"We presented a compartmental model of epidemic spread, which is a generalization of the SEIR model by adding an asymptomatic infectious cohort. The derived basic reproduction number is the weighted arithmetic mean of the basic reproduction numbers of the symptomatic and asymptomatic cohorts. In a limit case (for an empty asymptomatic cohort), the SEIAR model is the SEIR model with standard R 0 . This model was developed based on studies and clinical characteristics of COVID-19, but can be used, for example, to model the dynamics of the H1N1 influenza epidemic and other human-to-human transmission diseases. , and a number of days, when quarantine starts, from the first detected case (approximately 10 days after infection started). Days are shown from day 9, which is an estimation of a start of the phase 2 (outbreak). In case of two peaks of the epidemic, it displays the first peak. We are convinced that model SEIAR is the most simple model that can be used to simulate the epidemic dynamics of COVID-19. The standard SEIR model without an asymptomatic cohort does not match existing data, while the SEIAR model does quite well. Moreover, the onset of epidemics in different European countries corresponds to the simulations in GLEAMviz. The extremely rapid outbreaks in Italy and other countries, the functionality of only extreme measures, and the failure of measures that tried to protect and isolate only vulnerable groups are indirect supports for the suitability of the SEIAR model. Voices in the academic world are drawing attention to the asymptomatic group of infectious subjects. We are convinced that the asymptomatic cohort plays a crucial role in the spread of the COVID-19 disease.

COVID-19 has largely impacted on our societies through both direct and indirect effects transmitted by the policy measures to counter the spread of viruses. We quantitatively analysed the multifaceted impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on our societies including people's mobility, health, and social behaviour changes. People's mobility has changed significantly due to the implementation of travel restriction and quarantine measurements. Indeed, the physical distance has widened at international (cross-border), national and regional level. At international level, due to the travel restrictions, the number of international flights has plunged overall at around 88 percent during March. In particular, the number of flights connecting Europe dropped drastically in mid of March after the United States announced travel restrictions to Europe and the EU and participating countries agreed to close borders, at 84 percent decline compared to March 10th. Similarly, we examined the impacts of quarantine measures in the major city: Tokyo (Japan), New York City (the United States), and Barcelona (Spain). Within all three cities, we found the significant decline in traffic volume. We also identified the increased concern for mental health through the analysis of posts on social networking services such as Twitter and Instagram. Notably, in the beginning of April 2020, the number of post with #depression on Instagram doubled, which might reflect the rise in mental health awareness among Instagram users. Besides, we identified the changes in a wide range of people's social behaviors, as well as economic impacts through the analysis of Instagram data and primary survey data.","This paper aims at providing the summary of the Global Data Science Project (GDSC) for COVID-19.<q>We quantitatively analysed the multifaceted impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on our societies including people's mobility, health, and social behaviour changes.<q>Indeed, the physical distance has widened at international (cross-border), national and regional level.

109284,"Non-pharmaceutical measures to control the spread of infectious diseases and prevent a potential collapse of the health care system must be precisely coordinated in terms of timing and intensity. Based on well-calibrated mathematical models, the optimal intervention strategy for specific scenarios and objectives can be computed using continuous-time optimal control theory. In this paper, a generalized SEIR model was calibrated to reproduce the data of the initial exponential growth phase of the COVID-19 epidemic in Germany. Optimal control theory has been applied for the scenario in which an effective vaccine will never be found and the epidemic must be controlled with purely non-pharmaceutical measures. The computed optimal transmission rate describes a single-intervention scenario that satisfies two competing constraints: First, the minimization of the disease-related deaths by strictly avoiding an overflow of intensive care resources and, second, the suppression of a second epidemic wave by establishing sufficient natural immunity at the end of the measures. The optimally steered time-continuous non-pharmaceutical intervention ensures that the number of simultaneously infected persons does not exceed a certain threshold for a necessary period of time. Therefore, the optimal control obtained for this scenario is also of considerable interest for other cases, where e.g. a vaccine is expected soon but the number of infected cases must be held below a sufficiently low critical value over a longer period of time until the epidemic can be terminated by a mass vaccination. The optimal control computed in this paper is based on a relatively simple epidemiological model and the quantitative results for the COVID-19 epidemic depend to some extent on the chosen parameters. Therefore, the quantitative results should be treated with caution and must be compared with the results from more realistic models. Nevertheless, the described intervention scenario was shown to be qualitatively robust under parameter variation and has well understood and controllable stability properties. In particular, the control criteria (13)- (14) , which describe the optimal and stable path for easing the measures after an initial lockdown, are expected to be generally valid and could be directly applicable in practice. In summary, the control scenario described in this paper could serve as a guideline for the implementation and gradual relaxation of non-pharmaceutical intervention measures. Fig. 8 The stability of the disease-free stationary state depends on the size of the susceptible populationS and the basic reproduction number R 0 .

110199,"In this paper we introduced an age-structured SEIR model with a quarantine compartment. Three age classes were used: infants (0 to 19 years), adults (20 to 59 years) and elderly (60 to 100 years). First we studied the associated classical unstructured SEIR model without vital dynamics. The parameters were fitted by a least-square algorithm and the impact of the quarantine parameters p and λ were studied. Our main findings concern the existence of a numerical threshold value for the quarantine parameters: above a certain curve on the (p, λ)-plane, the maximum number of infected decreases in an accentuated way. This shows that an abrupt decline on the number of cases should be observed if the quarantine is being efficient. If this decline is not being observed, quarantine effort and time should be increased. The parameters obtained for the unstructured SEIR model were used to adjust the parameters for the age-structured SEIR model. Using this data, the basic reproduction number R 0 was calculated and its dependence on the epidemic values was studied. Our findings for the R 0 analysis are as follows: i) Class 1 is the most sensitive to screening measures (see Figure 8 ). Youngsters should be preferentially screened. ii) Considering the direct contacts within the same class, class 2 is the more sensitive (see Figure 10 ). Social distance between adults has the biggest impact on R 0 . iii) For the direct contact between different class, β 12 has the greatest impact on R 0 . Finally we studied the impact of age-oriented campaigns considering different strategies and different values of p for the total campaign effort. Recalling that p is bounded by the percentage of quarantined population (see remarks 3.2 and 5.1), our findings show that the highest possible quarantine must be made, and then, this effort must concentrate on putting into quarantine the total of elders and assuring equal proportions of adults and youngsters.

111064,"Our results suggest that first state COVID-19 case announcements do lead to a widespread increase in the extent to which people seek out Internet information about the epidemic. We find that announcements of first cases had the biggest effect on searches for basic information about the virus and its symptoms, suggesting that people attempted to educate themselves about COVID-19 and its effects. However, first case reports do not lead to a differential increase in searches involving large scale non-pharmaceutical interventions (school and workplace closures) that will likely have important consequences for everyday life. This may be because first cases are reported relatively early in the epidemic and many of these more serious mitigation strategies were not yet part of public discourse. Finally, although one might expect official news to reduce concerns related to false messages, we do not find much indication that state announcements of first COVID-19 cases affect searches questioning whether the epidemic may be a hoax. Overall, our analysis of Internet search data suggests that government information disclosure does help focus public attention on the crisis. Our evidence also indicates people seem to mainly react by seeking information on what they can and should do in response to the epidemic. This provides actionable evidence for those designing the next stages of public information strategies for the COVID-19 crisis and future threats to public wellbeing.

111571,"In this section, we discuss the different features of the proposed framework with reference to the applications and proposals discussed in Section 2. A summary of the comparison of our proposal 'CovidChain' with the other applications and proposals developed in recent times is presented in Table 2 . In all the related works we have analysed in this area, there is anonymity from other individuals, but very few have anonymity from the authority or government. However, in order to gain confidence of the population so that adoption rate of application increases, ensuring anonymity of individual from the authority is of paramount important. CovidChain framework takes care of both the aspects. In CovidChain, an individual gets to know only the covid status of another individual and though the authority has access to epidemiological data, it cannot trace it back to any particular individual. In many of the works, epidemiological data is not collected. However, an application like this is possible only if the authority mobilizes and invests a significant amount of public resources. In return, it is desirable that new knowledge is derived about the spread pattern of the virus so that novel strategies for containing the virus may be planned. Therefore, it is important that epidemiological data is collected taking care of the anonymity of individuals. In CovidChain, there is provision for recording of epidemiological data that can only be accessed by the authority; the general public cannot see the content as it is encrypted. Apart form Internet connectivity, two technologies that are commonly used in these applications are bluetooth and GPS information. While both these technologies are crucial in exchanging information about the spread of the virus, it is important that the information that are transmitted does not lead to compromise in security and anonymity of an individual. Moreover, one should not be able to transmit misleading information by impersonating as someone else. In CovidChain, there is proper mechanism to authenticate an individual. Here, GPS data related with an individual is never recorded in the blockchain. Only GPS data related with a containment zone is stored, using which an individual is alerted by measuring his her distance from a containment zone. As evident from the table, the focus of most of the work in this area is on contact tracing of people who might have come in close contact of an infected individual. Such works are of great importance as it may contribute significantly in identifying at-risk individuals who needs to be urgently quarantined and tested for the virus. However, in addition to contact tracing, it is equally important to ensure that quarantined individuals do not put other individuals at risk by coming out in public. Since, the CovidChain framework allows individuals to verify each other's covid status, like a digital-pass it may help in restricting quarantined individuals from accessing public facilities. In most of the works, accumulated data about the spread of the virus is stored in a centralized location under the control of a single authority. For such an arrangement, it is difficult to gain public support and confidence due to peoples' reservation regarding the privacy and safety of their data. It becomes difficult to assure people that their data will not be used for any other purpose after this crisis is over. Therefore, it becomes imperative that the structure and relevant portion of the data is publicly made available, so that it is open for scrutiny and audit. Such an approach not only helps in garnering public support but also helps various sections of the society to remain well informed with reliable data that they can use in their individual businesses. In CovidChain, blockchain technology is used for record keeping. As a result, same copy of the ledger is maintained at several locations with immutable data that can be accessed by all sections of the society. To contain the rapid spread of COVID-19, several smart phone based applications have been developed and proposed in recent times. Most of the solutions are focused on contact tracing of people who might have come in close proximity of an infected individual. However, in the current scenario when continued lock downs have brought the economy of several countries to the edge, there is a need to explore technical ways to facilitate both social distancing and economic activities to go hand in hand. Off late, quite a few countries are contemplating on allowing a section of their uninfected citizens to use smart phone applications as digital pass to join their respective work. However, success of such an approach depend highly on people participation, which is possible only when data are maintained transparently taking security and privacy concerns into consideration. In this paper, we propose a framework that can be used by people to protect themselves from infections while they are involved in their day to day business activities. The framework uses blockchain technology for secure and anonymous record keeping. The distributed nature of blockchain makes relevant data accessible to all stakeholders for their use and public scrutiny.

112483,"We introduced a novel epidemiological assimilation scheme to forecast and evaluate the current corona pandemic worldwide with a specific focus on Wuhan, China. We combined compartmental models in epidemiology with data assimilation schemes showing the advantage of real-time forecasting and parameter estimation in the current crisis. We discussed the benefits and differences in infection numbers when models are updated on a daily basis compared to static modelling. We then introduce a model extension allowing us to observe patients being treated, and patients being removed from the infectious population, which we labelled SITR. Since models are sensitive to estimates of the covariance matrices, we add a hybrid ensemble approach which allows for robust covariance matrix estimates. We find that in Wuhan the peak of infections is reached end of February, with the number of patients being treated peaking early march. The generalisability of our model allows the model to be implemented in other cases and countries such as Italy and the United States where the model indicates further growth in the United States and a decline of total infection cases in Italy. Since this work focused mainly on the methodology of providing a robust recursive Bayesian estimation for the current nCov-2019 outbreak, we propose a further in depth-study of the parameter estimates and a comparative study across countries focusing on the epidemiological implications. Future work can add further complexities to the model, such as taking into account different mortality rates due to population age, cultural norms or quality of the healthcare system, providing applicability and robustness of the model for different datasets and scenarios. We encourage both researchers and policymakers to run similar test results with data from other countries or on a more local level to estimate potential infection rates of outbreaks and the rate of transmission to implement the correct policy measures to contain and mitigate adverse effects of the pandemic.

112732,"The world is currently experiencing a devastating pandemic of a novel Coronavirus (caused by SARS-CoV2) that emerged in Wuhan city of China in December of 2019. The deadly COVID-19 pandemic has spread to over 210 countries, causing over 1.9 million cases and 125,000 deaths worldwide (with some parts of Asia, Europe and, now, the US suffering the brunt of the burden). There is currently no safe and effective vaccine for use in humans against COVID-19. There is also no safe and effective antiviral. Consequently, control and mitigation efforts against COVID-19 are limited to non-pharmaceutical interventions, such as social-distancing (which involves keeping a physical distance of at least 6 feet from other humans in public, lockdowns of communities, closure of schools, malls, places of worships and other gathering places), quarantine of suspected cases, contact-tracing, isolation (at home or in hospital) of confirmed cases and the use of face masks (both low quality cloth masks and the higher quality surgical masks) in public. This study is based on the design, analysis and simulations of a new mathematical model for providing deeper insights into the transmission dynamics and control of COVID-19 in a community. Specifically, the model designed in this study was parametrized using COVID-19 data from the US state of New York and the entire US population. The model was used to assess the population-impact of the aforementioned control and mitigation interventions. We parameterized the model using COVID-19 data from New York state and the entire US, and extensive numerical simulations were carried out using the parametrized model to assess the population-level impact of the various intervention strategies. With the baseline levels of the four main intervention strategies considered (socialdistancing, quarantine/isolation, contact-tracing and the use of face-masks), the state of New York is projected to see a peak of the pandemic around mid April, 2020 (with 66, 300 number of hospitalizations/isolation of confirmed cases and 105, 100 deaths at the peak), while the entire US will see its peak around end of April, 2020 (with 115, 000 hospitalizations/isolation of confirmed cases and 164, 000 deaths at the peak). Our projections for baseline (worst-case) mortality for the US are much lower than the 2.2 million deaths suggested by Ferguson et al. in the absence of interventions [34] , but fall within the range estimated in [65] . Our projected numbers for COVID-19 burden (morbidity and mortality) dramatically decreases if strict social-distancing measures are implemented at high adherence levels. For instance, it was shown that strict compliance to the statewide lock-down in New York state (which corresponds to reducing the baseline contact rate in our model by at least 40%) will reduce the peak values for hospitalizations/isolation of confirmed cases and mortality by 92% and 80%, respectively. Similarly, the peak values for cases and mortality in the entire US (if a nation-wide lockdown capable of reducing baseline contact rate by at least 40%) will decrease by 88% and 64%, respectively. The duration and timing of the termination of strict social-distancing measures are critically-important in the battle to effectively combat pandemics of respiratory diseases, such as the devastating COVID-19 pandemic. While the rapid implementation of strict social-distancing measures (during the early stage of the pandemic), maintained over a relatively long period of time (e.g., until the summer), will undoubtedly effectively combat the burden of the pandemic. Early termination of these measures will cause catastrophic outcomes. For instance, our study shows that relaxing or terminating the strict social-distancing measures in the state of New York and the US as a whole by end of April 2020 will trigger a devastating second wave, generating COVID-19 burden similar to those obtained during the pre-strict-social-distancing time in the state and in the entire nation by the end of July 2020 (with cumulative mortality numbers in the range reported in [65] for both New York state and the entire US). In particular, up to 144, 000 and 156, 000 cumulative deaths will have been recorded in the state of New York and the entire US if the social-distancing measures are shut down by the end of April, 2020. Extending the termination of social-distancing, such as to end of June 2020, significantly reduces the likelihood of a second wave (in addition to significantly reducing the associated burden of the pandemic). Consequently, a great deal of caution must be exercised before decisions are made to relax or terminate the existing highly-successful social-distancing protocols in both the state of New York and the entire US. It is noteworthy that countries that have recently relaxed these measures, such as Taiwan, Hong Kong and South Korea, have already started seeing a rebound of COVID-19. Our study suggests that the decision to relax or terminate the social-distancing measures should by on a case-bycase (i.e., state-by-state or county-by-county) basis, and should be informed by updated COVID-19 incidence and mortality data, number of COVID-19 tests (both antibody and surveillance tests) and proximity of a locality to COVID-19 hot spots. In particular, our study shows that strict social-distancing should be maintained until the year 2021 (up to late September 2021 for New York state, and early March, 2021 for the entire US) to eliminate COVID-19. Quarantine of people suspected of being exposed to a respiratory disease is perhaps the oldest public health control measure in human history. Our study shows that widescale implementation of quarantine intervention may not be very effective (in minimizing the burden of COVID-19) if the strategy of isolating confirmed cases is effective. In other words, our study suggests that if isolation can be implemented effectively (high efficacy and coverage), then quarantine of people suspected of contracting COVID-19 may not be necessary. This result is consistent with what was reported by Day et al. [71] . Tracing the contacts of confirmed cases (known as contacttracing) was also shown to only be marginally-effective in minimizing the burden of the pandemic. In particular, even if contact-tracing is implemented at the highest possible level (represented in our study based on increases in the contact-tracing parameters by 75%), the decrease in the burden of the pandemic recorded was only marginal (13% and 10% for cases in New York state and nationwide, respectively, and 5% and 3% for mortality for New York state and nationwide, respectively). The use of face-masks in public in times of outbreaks of respiratory diseases has a rich history. Although quite popular in some parts of the world (notably Asia), the use of face-masks in public is somewhat controversial. This was more evident in the US during the COVID-19, leading, ultimately, to the recommendation to use face-masks (home-made cloths masks) in public by the The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) on April 2, 2020. Our study shows that the use of high efficacy masks (such as surgical masks, with estimated efficacy of at least 70%) will lead to a dramatic reduction of COVID-19 burden if its coverage is high enough (at least 70%). In fact, our study shows that even face-masks of low efficacy (home-made cloths masks) will lead to a dramatic reduction of disease burden (albeit this will not lead to the elimination of the disease). For example, even face-mask efficacy of 25% can lead to a 63% and 64% reduction in the number of hospitalizations/isolation of confirmed cases at the pandemic peak in New York state and nationwide if 75% of the population wear face-masks in public. These results are consistent with those reported by Eikenberry et al. [52] . Furthermore, by generating contour plots for the control reproduction number of the model (2.1) (R c ), as a function of mask efficiency (ǫ M ) and coverage (c M ), our study shows that the use of high efficacy masks (such as surgical masks, with estimated efficacy of ≥ 75%) will, indeed, lead to the elimination of COVID-19 (in both the state of New York and in the entire US nation) if the coverage is high enough (about 80%). This study shows that the use of face-masks in public is always useful, and their population-level impact increases will increases efficacy and coverage. In particular, even the use of low efficacy masks will greatly reduce the burden of the pandemic if the coverage in their usage in the community is high enough. Furthermore, our study shows that combining the masks-based strategy with the strict social-distancing strategy is more effective than the singular implementation of either strategy. For instance, our study shows that COVID-19 can be eliminated from the state of New York if the strict social-distancing measures implemented are combined with a face-masks strategy, using a moderately-effective mask (with efficacy of about 50%) if only 30% of the residents of the state wear the masks. The masks use compliance needed to eliminate the disease nationwide, under this scenario with strict social-distancing nationwide, is a mere 10%. In summary, our study suggests that, like in the case of the other Coronaviruses we have seen in the past (namely SARS and MERS [10] ), COVID-19 is a disease that appears to be controllable using basic non-pharmaceutical interventions, particularly social-distancing and the use of face-masks in public (especially when implemented in combinations). The factors that are obviously critically-important to the success of the anti-COVID-19 control efforts are the early implementation (and enhancement of effectiveness) of these intervention measures, and ensuring their high adherence/coverage in the community.

113139,"The recent COVID-19 outbreak has been deemed a global health emergency. Internationally, the number of confirmed reports has continued to rise, and is currently placed at 90,870 laboratory-confirmed cases with over 3,000 deaths. It is perhaps clear that quarantine alone may not be sufficient to prevent the spread of COVID-19, and the global impact of this viral infection is one of heightening concern. Further research is undoubtedly required to help define the exact mechanism of human-to-human and animal-to-human transmission to facilitate the development of a virus-specific vaccine. Evidently, the pandemic potential of COVID-19 demands rigorous surveillance and on-going monitoring to accurately track and potentially predict its future host adaptation, evolution, transmissibility, and pathogenicity. These factors will ultimately influence mortality rates and prognosis. However, the rapidly evolving nature of the COVID-2019 epidemic, ever changing statistics, and constant unravelling of new research findings represents a major limitation to the present review. Nevertheless, as a surgical community, it is also our responsibility to be aware of the aforementioned signs and symptoms and to promptly escalate suspected cases.

Patients typically present with a combination of fever or cough and have a history of exposure to either a close contact with COVID-19 or travel to an affected geographic area. While most patients will have mild disease, some may develop severe complications including ARDS and multi-organ failure, with some succumbing to the disease. Special consideration should be given to those at the extremes of age, the immunocompromised, or pregnant women. No curative treatment is currently approved. Emergency physicians should obtain a detailed travel history from all patients and suspect COVID-19 in patients presenting with symptoms of an acute upper respiratory illness and fever. Early recognition and isolation of a patient with COVID-19 in the ED may help decrease exposure to other patients and healthcare personnel.

113534,"To summarize, this preliminary report provides insight on the early clinical and operational impact on ambulatory oncology due to the COVID-19 pandemic and can provide guidance on optimal management strategies for cancer patients in this setting. The poor outcomes noted among these confirmed-positive cases support the notion that cancer patients are particularly susceptible to this disease, corroborating initial reports from Wuhan [3] , Italy [4] [5] [6] , and New York City [9] , and supporting the approach of pausing RT for PUIs pending test results. Additional data are warranted to refine treatment strategies for this vulnerable patient population, particularly regarding potential interactions with ongoing cancer therapies such as chemotherapy, immune checkpoint inhibitors, and RT [17] . Intensive screening measures are instrumental among this population due to the relative immunosuppressed state of many oncologic patients; however, presentation patterns of COVID-19 may be altered in cancer patients due to oncologic treatments or malignancy itself. This hypothesis is supported by the wide heterogeneity of clinical presentations observed among our seven confirmed-positive cases: four patients (57%) initially lacked respiratory symptoms, and two (28.5%) were completely asymptomatic at diagnosis. However, six patients (86%) had radiographic presentations characteristic for COVID-19, with typical findings of bilateral parenchymal and consolidative opacities with peripheral lung distribution [18, 19] . Indeed, the diagnostic utility of chest CT has been demonstrated for primary detection of COVID-19, with reports indicating higher sensitivity than RT-PCR (particularly among early and likely asymptomatic cases) [20] . Rapid assessment tools such as imaging can supplement standard screening measures to facilitate early diagnosis and isolation protocols while awaiting laboratory confirmation [15, 16] . Upon suspicion for COVID-19, patients actively receiving RT should defer subsequent fractions pending RT-PCR test result. For confirmed-positive cases, the appropriate quarantine interval prior to restarting RT remains moot; however, our department has adapted the CDC-recommended non-testing approach for ending transmission-based precautions within the healthcare setting [21, 22] . Note that the CDC also detailed a test-based approach requiring two consecutive negative test results (collected ≥24 hours apart), but this resource-intensive strategy may lack feasibility depending on available testing capacity. Alternatively, the non-testing approach for patients with symptoms recommends passage of: (a) ≥3 days following recovery (defined as improvement of respiratory symptoms and resolution of fever); as well as (b) ≥10 days since initial symptom presentation [21, 22] . Regarding asymptomatic patients, the CDC similarly recommends a ≥10-day interval from positive test result. Note that this ≥10-day timeframe was revised from the initial recommendation of ≥7-days, based on emerging data of viral shedding duration [21, 22] . Due to concerns that stricter guidelines may be indicated for cancer patients actively undergoing treatment, our department has conservatively extended these recommendations to ≥14-days from the appearance of symptoms (and ≥14-days from positive test result for asymptomatic patients) prior to resuming RT, without a need for re-testing. One limitation of this report is the relatively modest number of patients tested during the initial pandemic at our center, which likely reflects a combination of variables. The most prominent contributing factor is likely the geographic heterogeneity of the pandemic, even within the United States: the incidence and trajectory of COVID-19 cases has consistently remained lower in Houston, TX as compared to Northeastern cities such as New York, NY or Boston, MA [23] . Across our department, early proactive efforts were also made to decrease treatment volume, through encouragement of shorter hypo-fractionated courses and two-week intervals between simulation and treatment start (when clinically feasible). Along with a decrease in multidisciplinary referrals, these changes culminated in a 26% reduction in treatment volume noted across seven of our RT centers during April 2020 [24] . In addition, rigorous screening and isolation practices further reduced the number of patients warranting testing. For example, our out-of-state patients were instructed to self-quarantine and self-monitor for ≥14 days before presenting to our Department for visit or treatment. RT is an integral component of many treatment regimens but traditionally entails frequent close contact interactions with multiple providers over several weeks of therapy; therefore, our center has taken aggressive measures to reduce exposures among patients and their care teams. In addition to infection-related outcomes, the continued use of rapid diagnostic and aggressive source control measures can help mitigate adverse effects on treatment delays and workforce incapacitation. While face masks were not initially recommended by the CDC for brief patient interactions, the dual PPE policy further decreases viral transmission among our high-risk patients to minimize workforce impact. Treatment delays and employee exposures are probable among suspected patients, but can be addressed with active tracking, rapid RT-PCR testing, and a dual PPE approach. Our team has continued tracking and monitoring of patients tested, treatment delays, and quarantined employees as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, in order to routinely assess the impact of operational changes over time. Following implementation of a ""dual PPE policy"" (for patients and providers), the number of newly quarantined employees decreased six-fold from 2.9 to 0.5 daily.

This study is based on the design, analysis and simulations of a new mathematical model for providing deeper insights into the transmission dynamics and control of COVID-19 in a community. Specifically, the model designed in this study was parameterized using COVID-19 data from the US state of New York and the entire US population. The model was used to assess the population-impact of the aforementioned control and mitigation interventions. We parameterized the model using COVID-19 data from New York state and the entire US, and extensive numerical simulations were carried out using the parameterized model to assess the population-level impact of the various intervention strategies. With the baseline levels of the four main intervention strategies considered (social-distancing, quarantine/isolation, contact-tracing and the use of face-masks), the state of New York is projected to see a peak of the pandemic around mid April, 2020 (with 66,300 number of hospitalizations/isolation of confirmed cases and 105,100 deaths at the peak), while the entire US will see its peak around end of April, 2020 (with 115,000 hospitalizations/isolation of confirmed cases and 164,000 deaths at the peak). Our projections for baseline (worst-case) mortality for the US are much lower than the 2.2 million deaths suggested by Ferguson et al. in the absence of interventions [34] , but fall within the range estimated in [65] . Our projected numbers for COVID-19 burden (morbidity and mortality) dramatically decreases if strict social-distancing measures are implemented at high adherence levels. For instance, it was shown that strict compliance to the statewide lock-down in New York state (which corresponds to reducing the baseline contact rate in our model by at least 40%) will reduce the peak values for hospitalizations/isolation of confirmed cases and mortality by 92% and 80%, respectively. Similarly, the peak values for cases and mortality in the entire US (if a nation-wide lockdown capable of reducing baseline contact rate by at least 40%) will decrease by 88% and 64%, respectively. The duration and timing of the termination of strict social-distancing measures are critically-important in the battle to effectively combat pandemics of respiratory diseases, such as the devastating COVID-19 pandemic. While the rapid implementation of strict social-distancing measures (during the early stage of the pandemic), maintained over a relatively long period of time (e.g., until the summer), will undoubtedly effectively combat the burden of the pandemic. Early termination of these measures will cause catastrophic outcomes. For instance, our study shows that relaxing or terminating the strict social-distancing measures in the state of New York and the US as a whole by end of April 2020 will trigger a devastating second wave, generating COVID-19 burden similar to those obtained during the pre-strict-social-distancing time in the state and in the entire nation by the end of July 2020 (with cumulative mortality numbers in the range reported in [65] for both New York state and the entire US). In particular, up to 144,000 and 156,000 cumulative deaths will have been recorded in the state of New York and the entire US if the social-distancing measures are shut down by the end of April, 2020. Extending the termination of social-distancing, such as to end of June 2020, significantly reduces the likelihood of a second wave (in addition to significantly reducing the associated burden of the pandemic). Consequently, a great deal of caution must be exercised before decisions are made to relax or terminate the existing highly-successful social-distancing protocols in both the state of New York and the entire US. It is noteworthy that countries that have recently relaxed these measures, such as Taiwan, Hong Kong and South Korea, have already started seeing a rebound of COVID-19. Our study suggests that the decision to relax or terminate the socialdistancing measures should by on a case-by-case (i.e., state-by-state or county-by-county) basis, and should be informed by updated COVID-19 incidence and mortality data, number of COVID-19 tests (both antibody and surveillance tests) and proximity of a locality to COVID-19 hot spots. In particular, our study shows that strict social-distancing should be maintained until the year 2021 (up to late September 2021 for New York state, and early March, 2021 for the entire US) to eliminate COVID-19. Quarantine of people suspected of being exposed to a respiratory disease is perhaps the oldest public health control measure in human history. Our study shows that widescale implementation of quarantine intervention may not be very effective (in minimizing the burden of COVID-19) if the strategy of isolating confirmed cases is effective. In other words, our study suggests that if isolation can be implemented effectively (high efficacy and coverage), then quarantine of people suspected of contracting COVID-19 may not be necessary. This result is consistent with what was reported by Day et al. [71] . Tracing the contacts of confirmed cases (known as contact-tracing) was also shown to only be marginally-effective in minimizing the burden of the pandemic. In particular, even if contact-tracing is implemented at the highest possible level (represented in our study based on increases in the contact-tracing parameters by 75%), the decrease in the burden of the pandemic recorded was only marginal (13% and 10% for cases in New York state and nationwide, respectively, and 5% and 3% for mortality for New York state and nationwide, respectively). The use of face-masks in public in times of outbreaks of respiratory diseases has a rich history. Although quite popular in some parts of the world (notably Asia), the use of face-masks in public is somewhat controversial. This was more evident in the US during the COVID-19, leading, ultimately, to the recommendation to use face-masks (homemade cloths masks) in public by The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) on April 2, 2020. Our study shows that the use of high efficacy masks (such as surgical masks, with estimated efficacy of at least 70%) will lead to a dramatic reduction of COVID-19 burden if its coverage is high enough (at least 70%). In fact, our study shows that even face-masks of low efficacy (home-made cloths masks) will lead to a dramatic reduction of disease burden (albeit this will not lead to the elimination of the disease). For example, even face-mask efficacy of 25% can lead to a 63% and 64% reduction in the number of hospitalizations/isolation of confirmed cases at the pandemic peak in New York state and nationwide if 75% of the population wear facemasks in public. These results are consistent with those reported by Eikenberry et al. [52] . Furthermore, by generating contour plots for the control reproduction number of the model (2.1) (ℛ ), as a function of mask efficiency ( ) and coverage ( ), our study shows that the use of high efficacy masks (such as surgical masks, with estimated efficacy of ≥ 75%) will, indeed, lead to the elimination of COVID-19 (in both the state of New York and in the entire US nation) if the coverage is high enough (about 80%). This study shows that the use of face-masks in public is always useful, and their population-level impact increases will increases efficacy and coverage. In particular, even the use of low efficacy masks will greatly reduce the burden of the pandemic if the coverage in their usage in the community is high enough. Furthermore, our study shows that combining the masks-based strategy with the strict social-distancing strategy is more effective than the singular implementation of either strategy. For instance, our study shows that COVID-19 can be eliminated from the state of New York if the strict social-distancing measures implemented are combined with a face-masks strategy, using a moderately-effective mask (with efficacy of about 50%) if only 30% of the residents of the state wear the masks. The masks use compliance needed to eliminate the disease nationwide, under this scenario with strict social-distancing nationwide, is a mere 10%. In summary, our study suggests that, like in the case of the other Coronaviruses we have seen in the past (namely SARS and MERS [10] ), COVID-19 is a pandemic that appears to be controllable using basic non-pharmaceutical interventions, particularly social-distancing and the use of face-masks in public (especially when implemented in combinations). The factors that are obviously critically-important to the success of the anti-COVID-19 control efforts are the early implementation (and enhancement of effectiveness) of these intervention measures, and ensuring their high adherence/coverage in the community.

113890,"COVID-19 is causing a global pandemic with a high number of deaths and infected people. To contain the diffusion of COVID-19 virus, Governments have enforced restrictions on outdoor activities or even collective quarantine on the population. One important consequence of quarantine is a change in lifestyle: reduced physical activity and unhealthy diet. 2019 guidelines for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease indicate that “Adults should engage in at least 150 minute per week of accumulated moderate-intensity or 75 minute per week of vigorous-intensity aerobic physical activity (or an equivalent combination of moderate and vigorous activity) to reduce ASCVD risk.” During quarantine, strategies to further increase home-based physical activity and to follow a healthy diet should be implemented. Quarantine carries some long-term effects on cardiovascular disease, mainly related to unhealthy lifestyle and anxiety. Following quarantine a global action supporting healthy diet and physical activity is mandatory to encourage people to return to good lifestyle.","COVID-19 is causing a global pandemic with a high number of deaths and infected people.<q>To contain the diffusion of COVID-19 virus, Governments have enforced restrictions on outdoor activities or even collective quarantine on the population.<q>One important consequence of quarantine is a change in lifestyle: reduced physical activity and unhealthy diet.

114315,"Abstract After an outbreak in Wuhan, China, a growing number of countries are now suffering from an epidemic by SARS-CoV-2, which causes COVID-19. Undoubtedly, reports of the skyrocketing global spread of COVID-19 has shocked people globally, from Japan to the United States.Presently, the World Health Organization indicates that fatality due to COVID-19 is about 2%, inferring that many positive subjects may potentially overcome the illness with mild influenza-like symptoms and no need for hospitalization at intensive-care units. Because COVID-19 is completely new to the human immune system, many throughout the world are likely vulnerable to becoming sick after their initial exposure to SARSCoV-2. Besides hospitalized cases, many individuals are likely asymptomatic but potentially carry the virus. While our knowledge about carriers and their virus shedding is deficient, some studies modelling the viral transmission have considered the potential contribution of the asymptomatic carriers. Protocols for managing asymptomatic cases, for example for controlling them to restrict their contact with healthy people at public places or private residences, have not been established.In-house quarantine may as well be applicable to asymptomatic cases if they could be identified and diagnosed. Presumably now, the asymptomatic subjects potentially contribute to the transmission of COVID-19 without their knowledge, intention or being diagnosed as carriers. Thus, managing the asymptomatic cases, who can carry and likely transmit the virus, is a major healthcare challenge while a pandemic is looming.","Abstract After an outbreak in Wuhan, China, a growing number of countries are now suffering from an epidemic by SARS-CoV-2, which causes COVID-19.<q>Undoubtedly, reports of the skyrocketing global spread of COVID-19 has shocked people globally, from Japan to the United States.<q>Besides hospitalized cases, many individuals are likely asymptomatic but potentially carry the virus.

115338,"This paper is devoted to the study of COVID-19 transmission dynamics using a specific multi-scale model. We calibrated the model using available data on the cumulative number of reported cases in two situations, one for relaxed control measures (Calabria, Italy) and the other with strict non-pharmaceutical interventions (Wuhan, China). The proposed model has several features which makes it suitable for the quantification of the effects of control measures on both the individual and population levels. First, we have used a microscopic social force model to describe the motion of agents. As a result, we were able to properly study the effect of social distancing in crowded areas. Numerical simulations with this model revealed that these measures do not prevent the transmission of the disease in high-density areas, especially when agents move under panic. Next, we considered the mode of indirect disease transmission which depends on the virus concentration on contaminated surfaces. This transmission mode is important in COVID-19 as SARS-CoV-2 can remain viable on various surfaces for a few days [3] . Another important feature of the model concerns the integration of measured characteristics of the clinical course of COVID-19. The incubation period was sampled using a log-normal distribution, which was fitted using clinical data [4] . Mean values for the periods from symptom onset to hospitalization, discharge, and death were taken the literature [39] . Finally, The realistic distributions of demographic and clinical factors allows the accurate prediction of the populationspecific CFR. We can tune the model to predict the response of different countries with different age structures and risk factors prevalence to the spread of COVID-19. Several conclusions can be drawn from the present study concerning the effect of epidemic control interventions. First, we have shown that panic situations could result in the spread of the disease, despite the adherence of individuals to social distancing measures. Numerical simulations with the social force model suggests that social distancing is not fully respected in crowded areas, especially when individuals move under panic. Situations such as panic-buying could result in the rapid spread of the virus. Therefore, control strategies for COVID-19 should aim to avoid the formation of dense crowds and should prevent the spread of panic. Furthermore, we have demonstrated that keeping a minimal distance of one metre between individuals is not sufficient to prevent person-to-person contacts in crowded areas. Next, the model have shown that pre-symptomatic transmission significantly shapes the outbreak dynamics. Therefore, modelling works devoted to the study of COVID-19 spread should take into consideration the effect of presymptomatic carriers. Besides, increasing the number of tests for COVID-19 is expected to significantly slow down the propagation of the epidemic as many presymptomatic carriers will get quarantined before they transmit the disease. After that, we speculate that the disinfection of public areas would result in a decrease in the number of patients reached during the peak of the outbreak. This is because we observe the same thing when we increase the decay rate of SARS-CoV-2 on hard surfaces. Finally, fitting the model to reproduce epidemiological data on the case of Wuhan, China, suggests that measures that are stricter than social distancing and lockdown were adopted to control the epidemic spread. We can speculate that the early wearing of masks, the washing of hand, and the following of cough etiquette, not only flatten the epidemic curve but also delay the onset of the exponential growth. Note that the model relies on a few key assumptions. First, the effect of unreported cases and asymptomatic transmission were not considered in the present work. The role of these 'silent transmitters' of infectious diseases was investigated in a previous work [44] . We did not introduce them in the present work, as there are no sufficient data on the infection dynamics of COVID-19 in asymptomatic individuals. We will study the effect of unreported cases using our model in a forthcoming work. Second, the model considers a relatively low number of agents. This is because of the high computational cost of the model. We have used periodic boundary conditions to approximate systems with a higher number of individuals. We expect the results to be similar for larger systems but with less stochastic noises. Finally, the study is devoted to the transmission dynamics in closed systems. The transport of people between the studied area and other locations could impact the epidemic dynamics. In the future, we will apply the model to investigate the transmission dynamics of COVID-19 in crowds, in urban areas with realistic configurations.

115769,"In summary, previous studies have reported psychiatric manifestations in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2, such as anxiety, depression and PTSD symptoms (4, 5). Since increased levels of cytokines have been observed in COVID-19 and in psychiatric disorders, we can place immune/inflammatory pathways as one of the mechanisms involved in mental health outcomes of COVID-19. Changes in the HPA axis have also been observed in SARS patients, indicating that alterations in neuroendocrine-immune circuits may be related to the psychiatric symptoms observed in these individuals. Therefore, the hypothesis of the present article is that SARS-CoV-2 infection can lead to neuroinflammatory and endocrine changes, which in turn may reflect poor mental health. However, it is important to note that related biological factors (e.g., older age, female gender, and overfat), together with other factors inherent to COVID-19 (e.g., social isolation, financial stress, and adverse effects of treatments) can influence psychiatric outcomes. Accordingly, it is likely that the psychiatric symptoms observed in COVID-19 patients are due to processes involved in the virus-host relationship, as well as to psychosocial and therapeutic issues associated with the pandemic. A further important aspect to be pointed out is the impact that the COVID-19 pandemic can have on people who are isolated to prevent the transmission of the virus and to prevent health system overload. Similar to possible mechanisms involved in the impacts of SARS-CoV-2 infection on mental health, social isolation may also be associated with dysfunctional psycho-neuroendocrine-immune interactions, which in turn can contribute to the development or the worsening of psychiatric disturbances (Figure 2) . It urges to put all ours efforts in understanding the pathophysiology of COVID-19, including CNS infection and the risk of mental health compromise, but also the effects of this pandemic in the healthy isolated individuals, including children and adolescents, so that to prevent a ""new generation"" of groups in which the risk of developing mental disturbances, as anxiety or depression, could be increased. If nothing is done, we will probably be doomed to face a new mental health ""pandemic"" in the future. In terms of social aspects, a number of short term simple attitudes or initiatives, can comprise the encouragement to: (a) strengthen bonds using social media and start thinking positively (140); (b) sleep properly and exercise regularly (141); (c) balance the diet, regular daily routine, relaxation exercise and other healthy lifestyle measures (142) . On the other hand, people should be avoid: substance use, eating too much fast food, excessive online activity, excessive watching television, and believing fake news (142) . It is also important to look for strategies that mitigate the impacts of COVID-19 on frontline healthcare providers. For instance, as recommended by Ho et al. (143) , healthcare organizations should introduce shorter working periods, regular breaks, and rotating shifts. Individuals who experience moderate to severe and/or persistence distress should seek help from mental health professionals or in hospitals in cases of emergency situations (142) . In addition, online consultation can be a potential alternative of delivering therapy (144) . Based on the similarity of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV, hematogenic or neuronal retrograde dissemination routes (via olfactory nerve) may be involved in the entry of the SARS-CoV-2 into the central nervous system (CNS). In the CNS (left) the virus can lead to increase in cytokines levels (e.g., IL-2, IL-6, TNF-α, IL-1β, INF-γ, and IL-10) due to its local or peripheral (right) actions. Increased cytokine levels are associated to neuronal death, synaptic plasticity impairments, dysfunction in the neurotransmitter metabolism and in the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical (HPA) axis. Likewise, social isolation can also lead to these neuroendocrine-immune disturbances, for instance: increase in cytokine levels, changes in neurotransmitter systems, HPA axis hyperactivity and disturbances in neuroplasticity-related signaling pathways. Through these common mechanisms, both SARS-CoV-2 infection and social isolation can lead to mental health impairments [e.g., impaired memory, depression, psychoses, anxiety and posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms (PTSD)]. IL, Interleukin; TNF-α, tumor necrosis factor alpha; INF-γ, interferon gamma. We also believe that art (especially music) can be an ally in the quest to improving mental health, whether for inpatients, health care workers, or isolated people. A meta-analysis study reported that music can modulate cytokine levels (including reducing IL-6 levels), as well as neuroendocrine-immune responses triggered by stress, including physical stress caused by viral infection (145) . In addition, it has been reinforced that music interferes positively in the immune system when subjected to acute stress (CO 2 stress test), also regulating the function of IL-6 and the HPA axis (146) . Therefore, music therapy can be a further relevant and simple strategy that might be adopted on a largescale basis, for individuals in social isolation (also including medical staff). Overall, it is important that political and health authorities pay attention to the mental health of infected and uninfected individuals during the pandemic, looking for prevention and treatment strategies, since poorer mental health can be associated with shorter life expectancy (147) (148) (149) and high economic burden (150, 151) . Beyond the immediate and fundamental task of saving lives during SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, the due care of his mental health should be timely addressed. Protocols aiming at minimizing mental problems during the infection as well as during recovering after hospitalization must be designed. In addition, studies that evaluate the impact of isolation during SARS-CoV-2 pandemic on mental health are important as they can guide new strategies to preserve population mental health in other critical situations that we can live in the future. Finally, it is noteworthy that the approach applied herein, related to psychoneuroimmunology in COVID-19, should be convergent with a social sciences approach so that to better understanding and to better tackling this disease. Hopefully, future studies may test the hypothesis outlined herein to better understand and consequently mitigate the impacts of COVID-19 on mental health.

116409,"As as discussed in the text, the Rio de Janeiro state governement implemented isolation policies in March 17, 2020, in order to avoid the explosion of cases of COVID-19. After the initial exponential growth of cases (from March 5 to March 24), the cases continue to growth, but it exhibits a distinct, subexponential behavior. The SIQR model with containment is capable of reproduce the mentioned sub-exponential behavior. Considering the data, we have observed that the initial exponential behavior changed to the sub-exponential one about 7 days after the implementation of social distancing policies. We found that the isolation policies really work, i.e., the fact of isolate people in home, to avoid social contacts, decreased the growth rate of the number of cases. For the considered parameters, we observed that the number of quarantined individuals grows, stabilizes and after it decays to zero, as it is standard in compartmental models. Based on the data, we can see that the number of such isolated individuals grows until Day 99 from the beginning (March 5, 2020) of the disesase spreading. Thus, the model predicts that the maximum number of quarantined individuals will occur about June 11, 2020. This is in line with a recent estimate [9] . That peak is associated with the quarantine of about 0.041% of the Rio de Janeiro state population (about 6, 700 individuals). This number is about 600 times lower than the one predicted by the SIQR model without isolation policies (taking k 0 = 0), suggesting the effectiveness of the social isolation. In fact, combining quarantine of individuals tested positive (confirmed cases) with social distance, i.e., multiple interventions, appears to be effective to contain the rapid evolution of confirmed cases seen in the early evolution of the COVID-19 in Rio de Janeiro state. This is in line with a recent work [9] , where the authors analyzed the potential role of nonpharmaceutical interventions in UK and USA. They conclude that the effectiveness of any one intervention in isolation is likely to be limited, requiring multiple interventions to be combined to have a substantial impact on transmission. Concluding, we proposed in this work to study the dynamics of COVID-19 in Rio de Janeiro state, Brazil, by means of a SIQR model with containment policies. We confronted the model results with data from the Rio de Janeiro state Department of Health [23] , and the agreement between data and our numerical results is very good. The data shows that the social distancing policies led about 7 days to change the initial exponential growth of cases and to effectively decrease the rate of growth of confirmed cases in Rio de Janeiro. The relaxation of isolation policies was also discussed, in order to avoid a second wave of cases. The impact of isolation policies in the economy is important to be adressed. There is a fraction of the population related to the informal economy sector. These individuals are less propensed to self isolate, which impacts in the spreading of COVID-19. It can be interesting to split the population in two groups: one related to the informal economy, and another group that has the option of self-isolation. This analysis will enrich the model, and it can help the polciy makers to improve both the social isolation policies and the support to the fraction of the population that cannot afford for the self-isolation. The explicity analysis of deaths also need to be studied. Those proposals certainly will be considerd in future works.

116612,"We present estimates of the incubation period for the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) that emerged in Wuhan, Hubei province, China, in 2019. We estimated the median incubation period of COVID-19 to be 5.1 days and expect that nearly all infected persons who have symptoms will do so within 12 days of infection. We found that the current period of active monitoring recommended by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (14 days) is well supported by the evidence (6). Symptomatic disease is frequently associated with transmissibility of a patho-gen. However, given recent evidence of SARS-CoV-2 transmission by mildly symptomatic and asymptomatic persons (17, 18) , we note that time from exposure to onset of infectiousness (latent period) may be shorter than the incubation period estimated here, with important implications for transmission dynamics. Our results are broadly consistent with other estimates of the incubation period (1, 7-9). Our analysis, which was based on 181 confirmed COVID-19 cases, made more conservative assumptions about the possible window of symptom onset and the potential for continued exposure through transmission clusters outside Wuhan. Of note, the use of fixed times of symptom onset, as used in 3 of the 4 prior analyses, will truncate the incubation period distribution by either decreasing the maximum possible incubation period (if the earliest possible time of symptom onset is used) or increasing the minimum possible incubation period (if the midpoint or latest possible time of symptom onset is used).

117235,"While emerging SARS-CoV-2 antibody testing is indicating a prevalence in some areas between 5% and 14.9% (County of Los Angeles Public Health 2020; New York State Department of Health 2020), the actual prevalence of infection in the general US population, as well as how many individuals with IDD are affected, remains unclear. In the USA, at least 5700 (12.8%) of the approximately 44 500 nursing homes and assisted living facilities have reported a COVID-19 case (Nadolny & Kwiatkowski 2020) . To date, 1.3% of our IDD homes have had at least one COVID-19-positive case. We report 66 positive cases in the first 100 days of the USA. COVID-19 outbreak in our IDD population of 11 540. Less than one quarter required hospitalisation, and those who did were more likely to have a higher chronic number of chronic medical conditions and were more often male. COVID-19-positive individuals with IDD share similar risks for increased disease severity requiring hospitalisation as the general population (Wu & McGoogan 2020) , with older individuals with higher numbers of chronic medical conditions at risk for being most severely ill, while most younger, less chronically ill individuals recover spontaneously. Overall, we found that a highly coordinated and frequently communicated approach to infection control, employee screening and visitor management facilitated the relatively low prevalence of COVID-19 in our congregate settings. Within our homes, we were able to readily isolate in place higher functioning individuals with IDD. Isolating infected individuals with significant behavioural conditions was more difficult, requiring frequent staff redirection to their room, and additional assistance with hand hygiene, cleaning and mask replacement. COVID-19-positive individuals with IDD who did not require hospitalisation were able to wear a mask, isolate in their room and recover with symptomatic support, without utilisation of acute care. In a home with five positive individuals, four staff members also tested positive. In this home, after consulting with the Department of Health, asymptomatic, COVID-19positive direct support personnel elected to shelter in place along with the affected individuals with IDD to provide needed support, as well as to avoid potential broader transmission to other homes, and into the community. The authors found it heartening that employees of the organisation donated additional food, activities, games and additional recreational supplies to help morale in the quarantined home. More generally, when a home had more than one case, efforts were made to cohort the positive individuals together, and to have the cases supported by any asymptomatic COVID-19-positive staff who donned appropriate PPE, and to create physical separation between affected and non-affected individuals within a home. In the next phase of our response to COVID-19, we plan to utilise diagnostic testing to enable a more precise approach to identification of cases, assessment of exposure risk and triage. We are currently procuring SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic testing capabilities to enable rapid point of care (POC) testing for individuals served and employees. Overall, we expect the POC testing capabilities to provide more rapid access to accurate diagnosisenhancing safetywhile decreasing unnecessary isolation for non-infected individuals with IDD and employees. We are pursuing a 'two-pronged' approach to testing 495 Table 1 Population with intellectual and developmental disability in 24/7 support programs and COVID-19 cases in the first 100 days of the COVID-19 pandemic (20 January 2020 to 30 April 2020) n Male n (%) Age in years Mean (SD); min-max Number of chronic medical conditions Mean (SD); min-max that includes nasopharyngeal swab for SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid to diagnose acute infection for those who are acutely symptomatic and a rapid POC test for IgM and IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 to determine recent or past infection by demonstrated immune response.

While all congregate living settings pose challenges for infection control with a highly contagious pathogen, we believe that vigilant infection control procedures, case and exposure documentation and real-time data analysis can be enablers of optimal, coordinated outbreak response.

117601,"The travel of SARS-CoV-2 into the human host is likely to follow no specific route, but several in parallel. Considering the infiltration in distinct neuroanatomical sites, we can infer a model of symptom progression (Figure 1 ) that is in line with our personal experience but also with other authors' reports about the early stages of the disease (Mason, 2020) . The nasal mucosa of humans seems a perfect environment for SARS-CoV-2 proliferation making it a potential reservoir for infection, like the salivary glands . A possible implication of the glossopharyngeal and facial nerve fibers has not to be FIGURE 1 | The symptom progression during the invasion of the human host by the SARS-CoV-2 upon nasal (olfactory bulb) access. The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus that was discovered in Hubei province, China at the end of December 2019 (SARS-CoV-2) is a single-strand positive-sense RNA virus with the encoding potential of four structural proteins: the spike, the envelope, the membrane, and the nucleocapsid. The human host presents many potential accesses, but the inhalation of infected respiratory droplets exposes the airways first. (N) Assuming a nasal access, the olfactory mucosa may represent the primary site of the host for viral proliferation. It is reasonable to believe that SARS-CoV-2 needs to replicate several times before it can reach a harmful potential to infiltrate in the olfactory bulb, with the smell alterations being reported as one of the earliest symptoms. (O) The terminal nerve fibers extend in the olfactory epithelium colonized by the coronavirus. Here, not only axons of the fila olfactoria can be used as routes for central access, but also the trigeminal branches, the terminal nerve, blood or lymphatic vessels, or the cleft under the ensheathing cells of olfactory axons. (P) Upon inhalation, alveoli get in close contact with the virus, and it is reasonable to assume that the local inflammation could affect the different nerve fiber populations comprising the neuroendocrine cells and the annexed vagal contacts. Lung infection, which might manifest even few days after the contagion, can therefore provide direct access to the solitary tract and other parts of the central nervous system. (E) Once the virus has been accessed the epithelial barrier of gut cells through mucus or other vector ingestion, it can colonize the intestines that are permeated with the lymphatic system that drains the villi, the blood capillaries, and both the extrinsic and intrinsic neural networks. A fluctuating but chronic symptomatic onset is easily found. (B) It is still not clear which is the main route for the central nervous system access that may have a critical role in SARS-CoV-2 nervous infiltration, but both the brain and brainstem are likely to be infiltrated. High temperature is one of the earliest symptom after infection when more robust immune response is triggered, thus subsequently being associated with a permeabilization of the blood-brain barrier and immune cell infiltration. Cardiorespiratory centers in the medulla are critical districts that, if affected by either direct viral damages or indirect neuroinflammation and hypoxia, can lead to irreversible damage and fatal outcome. excluded though. All three hypotheses previously advanced may be partially true regarding the smell disorders of infected patients. A partial nasal blockage for co-viral infections, an inflammation of the olfactory epithelium, and a viral insult at the level of olfactory receptor cells may all be concomitantly present. However, some authors recently suggested that the primarily targeted cells appear to be not the neurons, but those cells that would have been in charge of its early airway clearance through sputum expectoration, being the secretory and ciliated epithelial cells (Sungnak et al., 2020) . The third hypothesis may be postponed though, thus making the hypothesis of inflammation and mucosal swelling in the back of the nose of primary importance (Brann et al., 2020) . It is therefore still too early to acknowledge the nasal-nervous pathway as a potential route for host access and the local immunocompetence of the olfactory bulb may be sufficient to block the SARS-CoV-2 entering (Durrant et al., 2016) . Moreover, there are many other neglected routes for neuroinvasion: the trigeminal nerve, the terminal nerve, the enteric and pulmonary nervous networks, the vagus nerve, the dorsal root ganglia, the hematogenous flow through the circumventricular organs of the brain and brainstem, the peripheral lymphatic vessels, the central glymphatic system, the cerebrospinal fluid, the migrating Trojan horses, and the conjunctiva. That is, no viral passage across the olfactory bulb of the host has been confirmed so far and how SARS-CoV-2 gain access to and spread in the central nervous system remains to be explored. On the contrary, if dysosmia was an early sign of infection it could be too late to avoid neuronal affections as viral transport along axons is possibly moving about 2 µm/s in the retrograde direction (Bearer et al., 2000) . Because of the spatial distribution at the level of the head, it is much more likely that the preferred retrograde pathway is the one involving the shortest nerves at the level of the head, rather than the more systemic ones, such as the vagus nerve. Italy is one of the worst-hit countries in Europe with a death rate of 13.9% (WHO, report of May 8th, 2020). Among the currently infected, 72,157 are quarantined at home, 14,636 hospitalized in acute COVID-19 wards, and 1,168 hospitalized in intensive care units. Deceased patients had a mean age of 80 years old, 60.9% were males, 60.9% had three or more comorbid conditions (most common had been hypertension in 68.2% and ischemic heart disease in 28.4% of cases). At admission, the main symptoms were fever (76%), dyspnea (73%), dry cough (38%), diarrhea (6%), and hemoptysis (1%). A mean of 5 days passed from the onset of symptoms to hospitalization and the other 5 days from hospitalization to death (SARS-CoV-2 Surveillance Group of Italy, report of May 7th, 2020). Our direct experience in managing COVID-19 patients is in line with the abovementioned records. In addition, we observed also dysosmia being reported by over 80% of our patients. However, symptom reports at admission should not be taken for granted but contextualized on the feverish subject. In fact, all patients admitted to our hospitals are being classified as level 2 or higher (internal classification of COVID-19 patients compriseslevel 0: asymptomatic-, -level 1: mild symptoms, pharyngodynia, dry cough, mild fever, -level 2: moderate symptoms, high fever, persistent cough, asthenia, dyspnea, non-invasive oxygen therapy-, -level 3: severe symptoms, invasive oxygen therapy, intensive care). Our infected patients were all malnourished (Briguglio et al., 2020b) and disoriented in time and space, thus rendering it very difficult to make an exhaustive history about the dysfunction of the olfactory capacity and its onset in reference to the disease. These symptoms may also derive from excessive exposure to disinfectants due to the pandemic (Keyhan et al., 2020) , but also from medicines that are known to interfere with the smelly sensations and the aftertaste. On the other hand, many of our front-line colleagues infected with SARS-CoV-2 often reported a loss of taste and smell, which preceded the systemic symptoms, such a fever, loss of appetite, and diarrhea. Since numerous microthrombi are also being observed on peripheral limbs of our hospitalized patients, being likely to occur in pulmonary and cerebral capillaries as well, the neuronal damages should be of great concern. Other than antibiotics, antivirals, or corticosteroids, a therapy with lowmolecular-weight heparin at daily doses over 4,000 IU should be considered for hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Neuronal injuries in critical brain areas of patients that will survive may carry permanent consequences, as was observed for SARS-CoV-1 survivors (Hui et al., 2005) . Moreover, the risk of an impaired sympatho-vagal signal is worrying since its proper functioning is important for the peripheral immune response and central microglial polarization (Wang et al., 2018) . Some authors even suggested that neuronal cells could serve as reservoirs for the virus (Kabbani and Olds, 2020) . To the best of our knowledge, SARS-CoV-2 has not been found in nervous tissues so far. In Italy, brain autopsies are currently suspended due to biohazard security concerns (Previtali et al., 2020) . However, other authors reported the presence of the virus in the cerebrospinal fluid (Wu et al., 2020) and others observed multiple cerebral infarcts in vascular territories . Dead-end signs of the coronavirus cycle may reflect respiratory signs in the severe COVID-19 host, such as ataxic breathing, altered rate and synchrony, apnea, or hyperventilation. Overall, the survival of the virus in the nasal cavity plus its neuroinvasive potential is not a novel pathway of contagion among the infective agents. This double survival in two sites of the same host permits the virus to efficiently exploit its neurotropism while still preserving the host-to-host transmission (MacGibeny et al., 2018) . The risk of contracting SARS-CoV-2, like any other infection, primarily depends on the degree of exposure to the pathogen. Whether the infected host protects himself and others from contact might contrariwise depend on the level of awareness and, currently, there is no recognition of smell disorders being an early symptom of SARS-CoV-2 infection (Soler et al., 2020) nor it is established the association between dysosmia and SARS-CoV-2 olfactory bulb invasion. However, as the SARS-CoV-2 virus spreads, so changed the feature of its pandemic (Brussow, 2020) and the possibility that individuals can carry the virus without knowing is a risk that our society cannot take. Some individuals may show symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 infection 10 days after exposure (Lauer et al., 2020) , which is a remarkable amount of time during which asymptomatic individuals can be carriers without knowing. To conclude, we can say that: • Some infected individuals show dysosmia, which may imply nasal proliferation of SARS-CoV-2. • Public health actions should consider smell disorders when defining social distancing criteria. • Axonal, trans-synaptic, blood, lymphatic, or Trojan transport are routes for viral neuroinvasion. • Viral access in the peripheral or central nervous system may affect brainstem function. • Viral neuroinvasion does not rule out long-term neuropsychiatric consequences.

Multiple fields have used telemedicine to continue care while maintaining social distancing and quarantine practices in the pandemic. Presented in this paper is a review describing the application of telemedicine in caring for surgical patients, and methods for potential implications of telehealthcare for surgical patients during the COVID-19 pandemic. A review of the PubMed Central and Medline provides articles examining the role of telemedicine for preoperative, postoperative, and follow up evaluation of surgical patients encompassing the past two decades. Additionally, articles examining the financial and legal considerations of telemedicine, and the effect COVID-19 has had on the current legislature were included. We report the summarized findings of these studies, the financial and HIPAA considerations of using telemedicine, potential benefits, pitfalls and strategies for the utilization of telemedicine into the clinical practice of general surgery and its subspecialties during the COVID-19 pandemic.","Abstract The COVID-19 pandemic has brought rapid changes to the way care must be delivered to keep patients and providers safe while simultaneously managing limited resources.<q>Multiple fields have used telemedicine to continue care while maintaining social distancing and quarantine practices in the pandemic.<q>Presented in this paper is a review describing the application of telemedicine in caring for surgical patients, and methods for potential implications of telehealthcare for surgical patients during the COVID-19 pandemic.

117988,"Abstract We argue that enhanced Traffic Control Bundling (eTCB) can interrupt the community-hospital-community transmission cycle, thereby limiting COVID-19’s impact. Enhanced TCB is an expansion of the traditional TCB that proved highly effective during Taiwan’s 2003 SARS outbreak. TCB’s success derived from ensuring that Health Care Workers (HCWs) and patients were protected from fomite, contact and droplet transmission within hospitals. Although TCB proved successful during SARS, achieving a similar level of success with the COVID-19 outbreak requires adapting TCB to the unique manifestations of this new disease. These manifestations include asymptomatic infection, a hyper-affinity to ACE2 receptors resulting in high transmissibility, false negatives, and an incubation period of up to 22 days. Enhanced TCB incorporates the necessary adaptations. In particular, eTCB includes expanding the TCB transition zone to incorporate a new sector – the quarantine ward. This ward houses patients exhibiting atypical manifestations or awaiting definitive diagnosis. A second adaptation involves enhancing the checkpoint hand disinfection and gowning up with Personal Protective Equipment deployed in traditional TCB. Under eTCB, checkpoint hand disinfection and donning of face masks are now required of all visitors who seek to enter hospitals. These enhancements ensure that transmissions by droplets, fomites and contact are disrupted both within hospitals and between hospitals and the broader community. Evidencing eTCB effectiveness is Taiwan’s success to date in containing and controlling the community-hospital-community transmission cycle.","Abstract We argue that enhanced Traffic Control Bundling (eTCB) can interrupt the community-hospital-community transmission cycle, thereby limiting COVID-19’s impact.

118912,"The SARS-CoV-1 epidemic infected more than 8000 people in 29 countries between 2002 and 2004, caused more than 800 deaths [7, 8] . Although it is an epidemic and causes fewer cases and deaths than the COVID-19 pandemic, the spread of SARS-CoV-1 over 2 years cause pessimism about how long the pandemic process will continue. Today, we [9] . In our country, the pandemic is taken into account seriously. At the beginning of the pandemic, there was a fear that the health system could collapse in government officials and the public, and there was concern that many deaths would occur. The science committee chaired by our health minister carries out the pandemic process. The pandemic guide prepared by the scientific board and updated almost every day is used throughout the process [3] . Apart from those applying to the hospital, people with suspicious contamination in their environment were screened by the Ministry of Health filiation teams with the COVID-19 PCR test. There is no restriction or difficulty in using the COVID-19 PCR test kit. In the preoperative evaluation of the patients, COVID-19 PCR results were concluded within 6-12 h. As of today, the process is carried out successfully and no problems have been experienced in terms of the health system. We do not really know which stage of the COVID-19 pandemic we are in. Although the whole world hopes that it will end in a few months and life will return to normal, we cannot predict the genetic behavior of the virus or whether there will be two or more waves of infection [4] . In some countries, cases and deaths started to decrease but in another country or continent the pandemic is just beginning to spread [10] . All this uncertainty forces us to adapt to the conditions using the resources we have. Because other diseases do not have to wait for the pandemic and the annual mortality of many diseases, especially malignancies, is higher than the mortality of COVID-19 [11] . The general consensus shows that even 'Low priority' cases can be delayed for 6 months [6] . To adapt to this process, urology associations and many other surgical branches have published various algorithm and suggestion guidelines [6, 12, 13] . Unfortunately, expert opinions and suggestions are given due to the lack of evidence-based data when these guidelines are examined. These suggestions are presented by taking into account the mortality and morbidity rates of the diseases over time. At this point, we have created our own internal suggestion guide by our clinic sub-branches and started to implement it [14] . Very high rates of ICU requirement and mortality were reported in a study which presenting mortality and morbidity during the COVID-19 incubation period [5] . In this study, 34 patients were evaluated and intensive care was required in 15 (44.1%) of these patients, and approximately half of them died (20.5%). The disadvantage of these patients is being in the incubation period and this seems to be the cause of high mortality. In our study, the process was managed according to our algorithm, and 14-day incubation period was waited to prevent infected patients and then the patients were operated. Emergency operated patients were accepted as COVID-19-PCR (+) and operated in negative pressure operation rooms; then, COVID-19-PCR results were followed. Even if the COVID-19-PCR results are negative, they are warned to avoid leaving home and maintain social distance for at least 14 days due to an average of 5-day incubation period and possible hospital contamination [15] . Routine COVID-19 test was not applied to the patients after the operation. Patients were warned about COVID-19-related symptoms and were questioned by telephone. The city where the study is conducted has the highest number of cases in the country with more than 50,000 cases according to today's data [16] . We are one of the pandemic hospitals with the highest number of patients, and 5217 patients were examined during this 5-week period. Despite all these risk factors and patient burden, COVID-19 transmission was not detected in any of our patients due to the algorithms and principles we applied. COVID quarantine and follow-up were performed at least 1 week for 22 patients (33.8%) which operated in the last week, and at least 2 weeks for 43 patients (66.2%) who were operated in the previous 4 weeks. In addition, CO2-dependent COVID-19 transmission risk caused anxiety during our laparoscopic-robotic operations, as in gynecological laparoscopic surgery, but this problem was tried to be reduced by the smoke evacuation system [17] . In a study examining the comorbidities of hospitalized patients for COVID-19, the rate of hypertension, diabetes and cardiovascular disease stands out [18] . The most common comorbid diseases in our study were malignancies (21.5%), chronic kidney failure (10.7%), hypertension (7.6%), diabetes (6.1%), respectively. We tended to postpone in comorbid patients and we were more careful in terms of transmission risk and mortality rate if we had to operate these patients. As before the pandemic, emergency patients were treated without any delay after appropriate precautions were taken. All priority patients were informed about postponement and treated according to the clinical COVID-19 algorithm. COVID-19 infection was not encountered in any patient who underwent intervention. If the necessary precautions, isolations, and algorithms are followed, the COVID-19 process will be overcome with minimal damage, and urological interventions can be done safely in the pandemic. Priority urological interventions should not be disrupted in the presence of necessary experience, equipment, and infrastructure.

120343,"This study found optimal knowledge and perception related to COVID-19 and relevant universal safety measures among the Nepalese population, but misinformation and misunderstanding prevailed in certain important aspects of outbreak control. Particularly, a gap in knowledge regarding social distancing and quarantine and the negative perception that COVID-19 attacked only older people, and that coughing into elbow wasn't a good practice to prevent the virus spread were notable. Previous studies on knowledge and perception of COVID-19 are unavailable from Nepal and limited literature from international settings are available for cross-comparison. In line with our findings, a study from China reported that 90% of the residents of the province had good knowledge about COVID-19 [16] . An online survey conducted in the USA and UK also reported that participants had good knowledge of the mode of disease transmission and symptoms [17] . Some of the characteristics of our participants, which are also our study's limitations, explains the observed high knowledge. First, this is a web-based survey, but notably only 51.15% of Nepalese use internet [18] , which is mostly concentrated in urban Nepal [18] . Education status is a strong predictor of knowledge and perception [19] . The literacy rate in Nepal is only 66% [20] which is further lower in rural areas. All of the participants in our study had some level of formal education, and about 34% had a health background, either as a health professional or as a student. Together, all these characteristics of study participants suggest that they are more likely to be informed and have positive perceptions. On the flip side, it suggests that the COVID-19 knowledge and perceptions may be poor among the general population, especially those uneducated and without access to the internet, which should draw the attention of relevant stakeholders for disseminating information. Noninternet users and those without education are also the target population for future research on this topic. The importance of preventive measures in controlling outbreaks cannot be debated. A cross-sectional study conducted in the USA and UK suggested that awareness should be provided to the people focusing on the most effective preventive measures [17] . It is always essential to communicate the risk and preventive measures of the diseases to the public during the outbreak of a virus or microorganisms or hazards [21] . Given that a majority of our participants had heard about COVID-19 through social media, use of different social media may be an important and easily implementable platform, at least for certain segments of the population, to disseminate public health information and demystify the COVID-19 outbreak. Taking precautionary measures such as public-awareness, early detection, quarantine, and isolation, social distancing are important strategies to prevent the spread of COVID-19 disease. Providing the right information to the public at an appropriate time, which is now in Nepal's context because the cases have just begun to escalate in Nepal and reaching the peak of the epidemic is a few weeks away, is paramount. As knowledge and perceptions are important determinants of health behaviors [19] , with correct information and positive attitudes, the public-one of the most important stakeholders in outbreak control-can play an essential role in limiting community spread of the virus by adhering to national guidelines and adopting universal safety precautions.

120637,"The gigantic efforts come at a cost to travel and trade, to China's economy and beyond, let alone the mental health of millions of people under lockdown. These sacrifices are being made because the memories of SARS fuel hope that containment is feasible. Whether these rigorous measures will indeed result in the same success as for SARS depends on the extent of transmissibility of Personal View subclinical cases (asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic), including the timing of peak viral shedding during the course of disease, as well as on the role of fomites and other environmental contamination in propagating transmission. The answers to these questions will determine the success. Until those answers are known, the political and medical community needs to persist with containment efforts with the tools that are available at hand for the time being. China should be commended for its political will in implementing what might appear to be extreme measures. Undoubtedly, no other country could enact what China is currently ng. The daily decline in new cases by mid February suggests that China is on the right path, showing that containment could be feasible. Other countries should be aware and reduce the spread of COVID19. What is already known is that exportations to other countries need not result in rapid largescale outbreaks, if the countries have the political will to rapidly implement early case detection, prompt isolation of ill people, comprehensive contact tracing, and immediate quarantine of all contacts. If this approach is not feasible because of widespread community transmission, then community quarantine is also needed with rigorous implementation of social distancing. Containment of COVID19 should remain the focus at the moment. The shortterm cost of containment will be far lower than the longterm cost of noncontainment. However, closures of institutions and public places, and restrictions in travel and trade, cannot be maintained indefinitely. Countries have to face the reality that individualcase containment might not be possible in the long run, and there might be the need to move from containment to mitigation, balancing the costs and benefits of public health measures. Even if our public health measures are not able to fully contain the spread of COVID19 because of the virus characteristics, they will still be effective in delaying the onset of widespread community trans mission, reducing peak incidence and its impact on public services, and decreasing the overall attack rate. In addition, minimising the size of the outbreak or suppressing its peak can reduce global deaths by providing health systems with the opportunity to scale up and respond, and to slow down the global spread until effective vaccines become available.

120682,"In this study a four-compartment mathematical model was established for the SARS-CoV-2 infection, which could be useful in the policy decision-making process. Second, our model suggested that Italy, the UK, and USA likely had multiple sources of infections to account for the observed early sharp rise in the number of infected subjects. Third, effective and early implementation of quarantine were the two most important factors for control of the outbreak. Fourth, the relative contributions of quarantine, lockdown, social distancing, and the general facemask use were estimated. Finally, different strategies for lockdown exit were evaluated and challenges identified. Our model allows examination of the issues unique to SARS-CoV-2 infection, the highly infectious nature of this pathogen, the potential of this infection to overwhelm the healthcare system, and the alternative containment strategy implemented for this pandemic. The sensitivity analyses showed that, in the time from the index patient to control measures and effective quarantine, measures were most effective when the majority of the infected carriers, mostly asymptomatic 27-31 , were put under quarantine. Our data support the latest recommendation from the US CDC on the use of facemasks in public during this pandemic. Once the outbreak is under control, quarantine can be lifted through a data-driven, monitoring-based dynamic disease mitigation policy. Thus, general availability of a rapid viral diagnostic test is critical. A real challenge will be the potential to have both SARS-CoV-2 and other upper respiratory viral pathogens prevalent at the same time (e.g. this winter) when this pandemic is still ongoing. If this occurs, our model will require adjustment for two pathogens simultaneously. Our data highlight the importance for governments to act swiftly and decisively for any containment policies. 32 Also, any lockdown exit must be monitored closely with the potential for lockdown reimplementation. This four-compartment mathematical model describes SARS-COV-2 infection, can be adjusted to reflect local transmission characteristics and public health capabilities, can help to determine the optimal local disease suppression strategy, and can help when making projections for the best local lockdown exit strategy.

121768,"Household model has more clear and fixed exposure of infection sources which makes it feasible to estimate the transmissibility and infectivity of prevalent virus [7, 8] . Here, we found the general secondary attack rate of SARS-CoV-2 to contact members in households was 16.3%, which is the highest when comparing with those of two other coronaviruses related respiratory diseases, severe acute respiratory syndromes (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) [9, 10] and is also higher than that of pandemic influenza A in 2009 with 13% [8] . This might contribute to the dramatically higher number of infected cases than the two other coronaviruses related diseases.

121804,"As the mechanisms for the associations between COVID-19 pandemic exposure and mental health problems in the general population are largely unknown, this study examined whether alexithymia was able to explain this relationship. This cross-sectional study was the first to investigate the role of alexithymia as a mediator between COVID-19 pandemic exposure and mental health problems in a university student population, from which it was found that the students who reported probable depression or PTSD exhibited higher alexithymia and especially DIF and DDF than students who did not report such symptoms. It was also found that PTSD and depressive symptoms were strongly correlated with DIF and DDF. The regression analyses revealed that DIF or DDF were independently associated with PTSD or depressive symptoms in the home-quarantined university students, the SEM and mediation analysis found that alexithymia was a mediator between COVID-19 pandemic exposure and PTSD or depressive symptoms, and PTSD was also found to partly mediate the relationship between alexithymia and depressive symptoms. A moderate correlation was found between the DIF and DDF subscale scores and PTSD or depressive symptoms, and DIF and DDF were also found to be independently associated with PTSD or depressive symptoms, which was consistent with several other studies that had examined the associations between alexithymia and psychological distress measures in both clinical and general populations (Ciarrochi, Heaven, & Supavadeeprasit, 2008; Lipsanen, Saarijärvi, & Lauerma, 2004; Marchesi, Fontò, Balista, Cimmino, & Maggini, 2005) . One of the reasons for this could have been the commonalities between emotional identification and expression problems, alexithymia and mental health problems (Berking & Wupperman, 2012; Pandey, Saxena, & Dubey, 2011) . Another explanation could be that people with alexithymia and especially DIF and DDF have problems identifying and communicating their emotions because they fail to link their affective states to the specific situations, memories or expectations that triggered these affective states (Rieffe et al., 2010) . In other words, a person that scores high on the DIF or DDF subscales may find it difficult to differentiate between emotions and verbalization without realizing exactly what has caused these feelings (Leising, Grande, & Faber, 2009 ). Inevitably, an impaired ability to identify the causes of one's negative emotions might also prevent a person from adequately and adaptively handling that specific situation (Rieffe et al., 2010) , which could result in a continuous negative cycle that may eventually develop into depression or other emotional disturbances. The alexithymic difficulties in identifying and describing emotions have been associated with irrational social beliefs (Culhane & Watson, 2003) and specific memory process impairments related to happiness, which could increase (Takahashi, Hirano, & Gyoba, 2015) the risk of negatively interpreting social interactions. Therefore, the results of this study provided strong evidence that alexithymia and the associated emotional recognition and emotional expression difficulties contribute significantly to mental health problems (Berking & Wupperman, 2012) and could be used to identify vulnerable mental health groups. The finding that alexithymia was a mediator between exposure and mental health supported findings in previous studies that found that alexithymia mediated interpersonal trauma and depression (Hébert et al., 2018) and earthquake trauma and PTSD (Tang, Xu, & Xu, 2020) . The first important path in this study was that the number of exposures led to a more severe alexithymia (Eichhorn, Brähler, Franz, Friedrich, & Glaesmer, 2014) . In public health crises such as the COVID-19 pandemic, the self-quarantined students probably attempted to adapt by suppressing, denying, or distancing themselves from their own emotional needs (Spaccarelli, 1994) . These coping mechanisms, although beneficial in emotionally unsafe environments, may result in poor emotional awareness when employed over time, possibly giving rise to alexithymia (Canning, Canning, & Boyce, 1992) . Therefore, it is likely that alexithymia may develop as part of a coping mechanism (Parker, Taylor, & Bagby, 1998) to avoid exploring the fear and panic associated with COVID-19. Consistent with these interpretations, alexithymia has been found in people trying to cope with the emotions associated with an overwhelming stressor (Devine, Stewart, & Watt, 1999; Karukivi et al., 2010) . Therefore, in accordance with previous findings (Craparo et al., 2014; Güleç et al., 2013) , it can be concluded that traumatic events can cause emotional disturbances that people seek to cope with by withdrawing from identifying and/or describing their emotions. Therefore, identifying high-exposure students and lowexposure students is important when seeking to develop preventive measures and/or interventions against COVID-19 pandemic-related alexithymia symptoms. The second path found was that alexithymia increased the risk of depression, which was consistent with a previous study on alexithymia and depressive feelings (Lankes, Schiekofer, Eichhammer, & Busch, 2020) . Alexithymia is an emotional identification and expression deficiency that is characterized by a reduced ability to identify and describe feelings (McCaslin et al., 2006) . People with alexithymia may find it difficult to take advantage of social support (Wells, Rehman, & Sutherland, 2016) , may develop hostile interpersonal styles (Grynberg, Luminet, Corneille, Grèzes, & Berthoz, 2010) , and may fail to recognize their own emotions and those of others or the appropriate responses to those emotions (Kojima, Senda, Nagaya, Tokudome, & Furukawa, 2003) . Low social support has often been associated with depression (Stice, Ragan, & Randall, 2004) , and it has been proven that people with depressive symptoms typically engage in emotional inhibition strategies to deal with their symptoms and have significant difficulties in subjectively identifying and describing their emotions (hwa Son et al., 2012) . The third path found was that PTSD indirectly accounted for the link between alexithymia and depressive symptoms in the home-quarantined university student sample. It was found that alexithymia had a strong direct effect on PTSD, which was consistent with previous studies in which it was found that alexithymia contributed significantly to numbing and hyperarousal PTSD characteristics (Declercq, Vanheule, & Deheegher, 2010) . Not surprisingly, PTSD was also found to strongly predict depression in the self-isolated university students (Ginzburg et al., 2010; Tang et al., 2017) . Therefore, the current findings reconfirmed that PTSD and alexithymia both play an important role in the development and/or maintenance of depression in the acute stage following a trauma event. Within the context of these limitations, the results of this study suggested that alexithymia and especially DDF and DIF, which have been somewhat overlooked in previous studies, was highly associated with the development of PTSD or depressive symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, in terms of psychological services for university students, future studies could engage youths with COVIDrelated PTSD or depression in exercises to identify their own emotions and the emotions of others. Future longitudinal studies are needed to examine whether a lessening of DIF and DDF results in decreased psychological problems. This study extended past research and suggests that following a deadly pandemic, depression may occur shortly after the onset of PTSD symptoms. As alexithymia was found to be significantly associated with the participants' post COVID-19 pandemic mental health issues, alexithymia needs to be considered part of the etiology of trauma-related mental health problems in vulnerable groups. ","It was also found that PTSD and depressive symptoms were strongly correlated with DIF and DDF.<q>As the mechanisms for the associations between COVID-19 pandemic exposure and mental health problems in the general population are largely unknown, this study examined whether alexithymia was able to explain this relationship.<q>Another explanation could be that people with alexithymia and especially DIF and DDF have problems identifying and communicating their emotions because they fail to link their affective states to the specific situations, memories or expectations that triggered these affective states (Rieffe et al.

121983,"In this paper, we utilized a prospective space-time scan statistic to detect emerging clusters of COVID-19 in the United States at the county level, providing results at two distinct time periods. To our knowledge, this study is the first one that utilizes space-time scan statistics to detect emerging clusters of COVID-19 in the United States. The prospective scanning statistic is a valuable surveillance tool to monitor disease outbreaks as they unfold (Kulldorff & Kleinman, 2015) . We suggest that prospective scanning statistics should be utilized in the suite of tools available to public health departments and researchers. It is important to conduct rapid statistical analysis to supplement basic case and disease rate maps available to better understand the highest risk areas of COVID-19; and how risk will progress throughout the duration of this pandemic. Since March 18th, 2020, each of the 50 U.S. states and Washington D.C. reported a confirmed case of COVID-19 (Dong et al., 2020) . The prospective approach utilized in this study can be useful for state and local health departments to monitor the outbreaks in a timely fashion. The main strength of the prospective approach is the ability to add updated COVID-19 counts and rerun the statistic to identify new Fig. 3 . Spatial distribution of emerging space-time clusters of COVID-19 at the county level from January 22nd-March 27th, 2020. emerging clusters; while also tracking the previously detected clusters to determine if they are growing or shrinking in magnitude. ng so can help determine if current mitigation and isolation techniques are effective at curbing the spread of COVID-19. We demonstrate the notion of the prospective approach by presenting results between January 22nd -March 9th, 2020, and January 22nd -March 27th, 2020. The updated results in section 3.2 showcase the evolution of the COVID-19 outbreaks in the U.S., while 18 more clusters were detected using the updated daily case data. Notably, Manhattan became the epicenter of COVID-19 in the U.S., with a staggering 25% of the confirmed cases across the country. Furthermore, New Orleans and the Fort Lauderdale/Miami areas became hotspots in the southern U.S. Wayne County, Michigan contains Detroit, which also was detected as one of the major hotspots in the U.S when adding the updated daily cases to the prospective scan statistic. One way to further evaluate the evolution of the detected clusters is to relax the statistical significance required (i.e. p < 0.05) and rerun the analysis at numerous spatial and temporal scales. As a result, we can identify locations that may become significant in a few days or a week's time but is beyond the scope of this exploratory paper. Furthermore, the incidence rates are not uniform across the U.S. Population density, age groups, and state and local mitigation measures will influence COVID-19 transmission and the magnitude of current and newly detected spacetime clusters. Healthcare facilities and resources will continue to be tested as more cases are suspected and confirmed with increases in testing (Heymann & Shindo, 2020; Yee et al., 2020) . Isolation measures and intensive contact tracing can successfully control COVID-19 outbreaks and reduce the burden facing hospitals and healthcare providers (Hellewell et al., 2020) . Enhanced hygiene and stricter social distancing measures are required to reduce SARS-CoV-2 circulation, especially when community transmission is detected (Dalton, Corbett, & Katelaris, 2020) . Availability of public datasets are also critical to increase surveillance efforts across the globe and corresponding areas facing substantial increases in transmission (Sun, Chen, & Viboud, 2020) . Confirmed case counts are not enough to understand the true magnitude of the COVID-19 pandemic. Compiling datasets that include suspected, probable, and negative test counts can substantially improve surveillance efforts and our understanding of COVID-19 transmission dynamics (Lipsitch, Swerdlow, & Finelli, 2020) . Despite the strengths of our study, there are limitations worth mentioning. First, there are many counties that were included in the clusters that did not contain any reported cases of COVID-19; however, this is due to the scanning process (an artifact of the statistic) and is circumvented by reporting the relative risk for the locations that belong to each cluster. Second, the case data only include confirmed cases and it is important to highlight that suspected and probable cases are not considered due to unavailability and uncertainty. Therefore, the true magnitude of the COVID-19 pandemic and will not be known for some time. Third, more local-level surveillance and studies are required to understand the transmission dynamics of the current and future emerging clusters; as SaTScan is an exploratory statistic. Fourth, COVID-19 is more severe for the elderly and those with preexisting medical conditions. Future studies can implement case/control cluster techniques with death and case counts (e.g. space-time Bernoulli models), while simultaneously adjusting for age and other relevant covariates. It is also possible to adjust for younger age groups to examine if mitigation guidelines have been successful in any way. Finally, this study utilized COVID-19 case data up until March 27th, 2020. Therefore, the magnitude and number of emerging clusters in our county-level analysis is likely much higher as cases continue to increase across the U.S. We utilized publicly available case data from Johns Hopkins University's Center for Systems Science and Engineering to detect emerging space-time clusters of COVID-19 at the county level in the United States for two separate time periods. We suggest that the counties belonging to emerging clusters should be prioritized when allocating resources and implementing various quarantine and isolation measures to slow viral transmission. COVID-19 and general infectious disease surveillance can benefit from our prospective approach by monitoring outbreaks as they happen as new data becomes available. We emphasize the importance of focusing surveillance on emerging and active clusters during epidemics, essentially dismissing previous clusters that do not threaten public health that would appear in a retrospective analysis. Furthermore, data sharing and availability is crucial and allows a variety of researchers to contribute to our knowledge of COVID-19 and epidemiology, in general. Geographers can play a vital role in mitigating disease transmission, and this study is one example of the plethora of methods that can be implemented in a limited timeframe to effectively inform public health officials and decision-makers about spatial and space-time transmission dynamics.

122067,"We used the various online sources along with the data from government organizations for ten countries to screen the flights and passengers form 24 airports connecting various international airports in India. As of 4th March 2020 India has started the thermal screening of passengers arriving from 12 countries, viz. China, South Korea, Japan, Italy, Iran, Singapore, Thailand, Malaysia, Hong Kong, Vietnam, Nepal, and Indonesia. It is, however, not clear if the passengers either travelling and/or transiting through any of the airports form middle east, especially Dubai, were also being subjected to thermal screening. If that was not the case, it is very important to mention that nonscreening of passengers arriving through large transit hub like Dubai (DXB) and were infected could have remained undetected, which later on went on to became positive cases. On the other hand, the stamping of the passengers initiated by authorities in India came as one of the most effective steps, as long as it was stringently executed by authorities and followed by passengers for the self-quarantined for the prescribed period. We strongly emphasize that this was one of the most effective way to contain the spread due to importation of the infected passengers in two following ways. a. a full database of the passenger was being obtained at the time of the screening, and b. it is much easier and feasible to track the very same passenger for next 14 days, which is the advisable quarantine period. Such a screening and additional measures like stamping need not be restricted for the passengers arriving only from largely affected countries but must be extended to the passengers coming from large transit hub in future. For example, at the time of initiating the thermal screening for the passengers arriving from Singapore, there were not many cases registered in Singapore or other east Asian countries. As per our understanding such a measure was implemented primarily to identify the passengers arriving from China, which was epicenter of pandemic, transiting through one of the east Asian countries particularly Singapore airport. Overall, we believe that the effective measures taken by the government and authorities at various international airports in India were adequate and effective, although they were restricted only to the passengers arriving from largely infected countries. We, however, also note that the screening and quarantining of the passengers arriving from major transit hub could also have been strictly implemented from the very beginning. We also recommend that international flight operations in India could be cautiously opened in phased manner. We are also of the opinion, based on our analysis, that only one airport can be considered for international operations until the global pandemic is substantially brought under control. Neverthless, these policies are just suggestions and can be reviewed periodically. It is very important to note that analyses presented here involve the modeling and estimation based on combination of various different data sources. Under such a situation, where large datasets from various sources is combined to derive certain index, requires a lot of assumptions to consider, and pose various limitations. All these simulations and subsequent estimation heavily rely on the accuracy and reasonable assumption of passenger seats and flight data. In this way, we are not aware of any particular methodology to validate our model, except that comparing the derived importation risk index with actual number of passengers, which for our study is in good agreement. Nevertheless, our results provide data and methodology, which in a nominal way could be used for effective measures and mitigation policies to be implemented at travel hubs for effective containment of travel related risk of infections. Lastly the study presented here completely relies on the data available at this period of time and can be further tuned in future as and when additional data is available, which may substantially alter the results/conclusions presented here.

122272,"We aimed to present an initial perception of the transmission dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 in Hubei Province, China, and to enable a quantification of the potential risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission outside China, especially when an infected patient from China arrives in developed countries. We used confirmed data from the clusters of COVID-19 cases that occurred from January 11 to February 6, 2020 in Hubei Province, China. Many researchers have warned the possibility of outbreak outside of China. Thompson calculated the potential transmission when the patients arrived in other countries [11] . The risk of outbreak according to the imported cases, the connectivity of the country with China, and the efficacy of control measures is estimated [12] . In addition, studies have been conducted on the impact of international travel and border control measures on the spread outside China (global spread) [13, 14] . In this study, we used mathematical modeling and stochastic simulation to estimate the reproductive number and analyze interventional measures. The reproductive number for SARS-CoV-2 transmission dynamics is estimated approximately as 4, which is significantly higher compared to that of the previous SARS epidemic in China [15] . This Table 2 propensity of individual events Event Propensity implies that human-to-human transmission is significant in Hubei Province. Unless additional interventional strategies are implemented, there will be a significant increase in the daily incidence of new cases. However, several control policies are being implemented in China, such as public education on disease prevention and environmental hygiene. It is possible that the transmission rate and reproductive number have been decreased such that the number of new cases will be less than the number in the model prediction. The reproductive number derived in this work facilitates the evaluation of control measures, such as quarantine or transmission-intervention strategy. To reduce the reproductive number to less than 1 with a single intervention measure, we need to either reduce the rate of transmission by more than 75.72% or shorten the duration from infection to quarantine to less than 29.1 h. From January 31, 2020 onward, a real-time confirmatory procedure has been instituted whereby the time to laboratory confirmation can be reduced to 6 h [16] . Moreover, a rapid diagnosis test kit has been provisionally approved, and this new diagnostic method has become available since February 7, 2020, which could possibly enable faster diagnosis and quarantine [17] . If two strategies are implemented simultaneously, the requirement for each intervention strategy will be reduced when compared to the requirement for a single-intervention strategy. For example, if the rate of transmission is reduced by 10%, the quarantine from symptom onset needs to be implemented within 32.37 h. In this study, we assumed that the probability of transmission from exposed individuals was zero because of insufficient epidemiological evidence that could be applied in the model. However, if we assume that exposed individuals have a 20% rate of transmission compared to symptomatic individuals, the reproductive number would be reduced to 3.4796. Furthermore, our model assumes that quarantined individuals would not transmit the disease. Ignoring this assumption would result in a higher reproductive number. This study was conducted with an aim to understand the requirements of sufficient preparedness to counter the spread of SARS-CoV-2 infection outside China; thus, we assumed the highest rate of transmission. Moreover, a stochastic simulation was conducted to measure the probability of an outbreak and its size when a person The WHO has warned of the possibility of global spread to other countries, and public health authorities in these countries are expected to develop preparedness strategies, such as thorough campaigns for enhancing personal hygiene, screening the national borders, and quarantine of individuals with suspected infection or exposure, to respond to disease spread. In South Korea, the first case of COVID-19 was reported on January 20, 2020, and a total of 24 confirmed cases, who are mostly individuals who returned from the Chinese city of Wuhan, have been reported as of February 7, 2020. Among these cases, nine were identified as local transmissions (human-to-human transmission) arising from contact with patients from China or with a secondary infectiontransmitted person in South Korea [18] . Given that the average duration from symptom onset to quarantine is approximately 24 h in South Korea, the rate of transmission is considered to be approximately 50% lower than that in Hubei province. In the United States, one case of local transmission has been identified from among 11 confirmed cases with the SARS-CoV-2 infection [19] . The local transmission of infected case per import case is 1/11, and this implies that the rate of transmission is reduced by approximately 90% compared to that in the Hubei Province, if a patient can be quarantined within 24 h after symptom onset. Results from our risk estimation of the COVID-19 outbreak outside China accentuate the importance of quarantine control, such as through specific guidelines with regard to visitors who have traveled from China. The results of our stochastic simulation emphasize that rapid quarantine before the rate of community transmission increases is crucial to prevent a COVID-19 outbreak outside of China. Even if the rate of transmission is assumed to be similar to that in Hubei Province, the probability of no local transmission is approximately 54.9% with the implementation of a 24-h quarantine strategy. In addition, there is only a 7% chance of seeing more than 20 cases of local transmission. Thus, quarantine is implicated as a significantly important measure to minimize community transmission. This study has some limitations. First, our model was developed with limited confirmed data from the Hubei Province of China; given that the outbreak has not ended, the model dynamics could change as new confirmed cases are added. Second, more detailed patient information, particularly the dates of symptom onset and exposure, were unavailable at the time of analysis. Third, this study was conducted on the basis of data from confirmed COVID-19 patients with symptomatic onset who underwent testing. However, some cases of asymptomatic infection have been identified [20, 21] and, given the availability of options for assessment at present, it is difficult to explicitly estimate the possibility of transmission or the number of asymptomatic infections based on the observational empirical data. Nonetheless, even a model with limited data, such as the one in this study, can allow an early assessment of the transmission dynamics of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic in the Hubei Province, China. This study describes an outbreak of the SARS-CoV-2 that originated in the Hubei Province and estimates the reproductive number. The epidemic has spread significantly due to failures in early diagnosis and rapid quarantine. In view of the difficulty in controlling this outbreak, our results lead us to strongly recommend that an infected person be quarantined as soon as possible after diagnosis to reduce the possibility of SARS-CoV-2 transmission outside China.

Isolation of individuals in combination with fear of contagion, quarantine and stigma, as well as with potential (mis)information overload (“infodemic”)(1), however, causes chronic stress and is associated with a burden on mental health, posing risk factors for anxiety and depression. It is well understood that chronic stress is a major modulator of immunity(2) and thus directly influences probability of infection.","It is well understood that chronic stress is a major modulator of immunity(2) and thus directly influences probability of infection.<q>The Covid‐19 epidemic necessitates the application of strict isolation strategies to curb virus spreading.

123038,"In this study, we retrospectively reviewed 142 patients and 11 medical staff members who were exposed to a COVID-19+ ophthalmologist. No case of validated disease transmission was identified among patients or medical staff. One patient reported suggestive symptoms, but his RT-PCR results came back negative and he had fully recovered from the symptoms within few days. As the COVID-19 pandemic evolved and was starting to emerge in Israel, we have changed our day to day conduct in the ophthalmology clinic. Physicians were instructed to refrain from staying together in the same room or less than 2m distance from each other as much as possible, the importance of hand hygiene was further emphasized, social encounters (in staff rooms, etc.) were reduced to a minimum, and telemedicine was encouraged. Furthermore, clinic visits and slit lamp exam (with enlarged breath shields) were significantly reduced. Staff was allocated to three separate groups, and interactions among these groups were prevented. In the retina clinic, optical coherence tomography was often the sole criteria when deciding if an intravitreal injection is necessary for recurrent patients. The majority of patients that were in contact with the COVID-19+ physician in the current study underwent intravitreal injection. The use of a surgical mask during the injection preparation and procedure is advised in order to minimize the spread of droplets containing oral contaminants from the staff [17] . As part of the standard practice of intravitreal injection in our clinic, the injections are performed in dedicated rooms equipped with a fan-filtering unit (FFU) with highefficiency particulate air (HEPA) filter, where the injecting ophthalmologist and other members of the medical staff in the room are wearing surgical masks and a non-talk policy is taken. Stricter protective measures are taken for surgical procedures. These standard safety measures conceivably prevented SARS-CoV-2 transmission to patients and coworkers alike. This is further supported by a case report by Kangqi et al., where out of 41 healthcare workers that were exposed to a confirmed COVID-19+ patient, none was infected; 85% of the workers were protected by a surgical mask only, and the rest by N95 masks [18] . Importantly, surgical mask or gloves were not routinely worn at the time of the incident for standard slit lamp exam or PRP laser treatment (these protection measures were later employed), and minority of the patients wore masks. Altogether, 19 patients were cared for by a COVID-19+ physician while he was symptomatic and while both parties did not wear masks. In theory, these patients had a greater chance of being infected, yet, none had developed COVID-19. Caveats of the study include its retrospective design. Not all of the patients that have been in contact with the COVID-19-positive physician had performed RT-PCR tests for COVID-19 infection. As was suggested by other reports, there might be some patients that have been infected but remained asymptomatic [7, 19] . In addition, virus transmission may vary among patients and ""super-spreaders"" may exist. Accordingly, if the COVID-19+ staff member would have been a ""super-spreader,"" the outcome of the scenario might have been different. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to report the outcome of exposure of patients and staff to COVID-19+ staff member in the setting of an ophthalmologic clinic. The transmission rate in this report was very low while standard safety measures such as social distancing, hand hygiene, and mask wear during intravitreal injections were taken. More studies of this nature are needed in order to shed more light into the risk of transmission of COVIC-19 in the setting of ophthalmic care.

123682,"In this paper, we propose an epidemic model for networked population with recurrent mobility pattern. A heterogeneous network is used to represent the structure containing different connections. There are two types of edges, social connections among individuals and mobility connections between individuals and common areas. A detailed formulation by discrete-time Markov chain method to describe the dynamics of epidemic spreading is given, and we derive theoretical results about epidemic threshold. Several simulations on both Erdös-Rényi and power-law social networks are conducted and experimental results verify the correctness of our model and analysis. The non-monotonic relationship between epidemic threshold and mobility possibility indicates there is an optimal value which will make virus hard to spread. The influences of different values of isolation factor which restricts infected individuals from getting into common areas are analysed, and more obvious dispersion appears in power-law network because of heterogeneity of degree distribution. In addition, we demonstrate and prove the exponential decay of infection when epidemic rate is less than threshold. In summary, this pa-per not only provides an approach to model epidemic spreading in networked population with recurrent mobility pattern, but offers a tool to analyse different network structures and social measures, such as restricting infected individuals.

123979,"Similar to SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 has been reported to be highly communicable in hospital setting (10, 11). High attack rate of SARS-CoV-2 among healthcare workers with direct patient care has been observed worldwide, including China, Italy, and United States, etc. Our study examined the seroprevalence of the 105 HCWs exposed to COVID-19 patients without wearing PPE at early period of outbreak in a tertiary hospital of China. Of note, 56 HCWs were exposed to COVID-19 patients as colleagues, while 49 HCWs were exposed during performing direct care for patient or general service. Despite the swab samples from all HCWs collected at twice were negative for SARS-CoV-2 RNA, our serological analysis indicated 17.1% of asymptomatic or subclinical infection of SARS-CoV-2 in hospital setting. Consistent with the efficient transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2, our serological analysis in the hospital setting highlighted a higher percentage of asymptomatic or subclinical SARS-CoV-2 infection than that of SARS-CoV (12) (13) (14) (15) and MERS-CoV (16) . Our data suggested that those with asymptomatic or subclinical infection of SARS-CoV-2 were able to be seroconverted. All the nasopharyngeal swab samples collected twice were found to be negative for SARS-CoV-2. This could because that the modest level of viral load from nasopharyngeal swabs was beyond detection. Also, the nasopharyngeal swab samples were not longitudinally collected and the positive samples might be missed. Therefore, serological testing is an ideal approach to assess the proportion of people who might experience the asymptomatic or subclinical infection of SARS-CoV-2, which is critical to understand the viral transmissibility and disease burden during COVID-19 pandemic. Previous studies on human coronaviruses have shown that NP protein and RBD region are highly immunogenic, which have been successfully applied in EIA-based approach for serological analysis (14, 17, 18) . In order to eliminate the possibility of cross-reactivity with other human coronaviruses, RBD and NP protein were used as two antigens in our assay, similar to a recent published study (19) . We found that all the healthy controls in 2019 and the non-COVID-19 pneumonia patients were 100% found to be negative, while 93.3% of serum from COVID-19 patients were proved to be positive, suggesting our ELISA assay has high sensitivity and fine specificity. By using EIA assay, 19 samples were discovered positive for detectable IgM or IgG responses to both RBD and NP protein, while the antibody responses among these HCWs were relatively lower compared with COVID-19 patients. Meanwhile, 18 out of 19 sera samples displayed neutralization activities. Consistent with recent findings (19), the level of neutralization activity was associated with anti-NP IgG response and anti-RBD IgG response. Whether those seropositive HCWs acquired protective immunity from SARS-CoV-2 infection remains unknown. Active surveillance and longitudinal followup to close contacts should be attached more importance.

Our study results revealed that attitude toward epidemic outbreak has a strong mediation effect between the role of E-Govt and online social presence during outbreaks, indicating that other governments and organizations can follow China's safety model. The Chinese government allowed full opportunity to be online and for online users to promote hand washing and mask wearing during the COVID-19 outbreak. As for as effect of 2019-nCoV-WOM and online social presence is concerned, our study findings are supported a the previous study [102] in which human voice and WOM were found to have a positive impact on social presence. Our findings showed that 2019-nCoV-WOM has a positive effect on online social presence. Online social presence is increasing worldwide. Social media has become increasingly important, especially for COVID-19 information. In this study, we determined the impact of the role of e-government and COVID-19 word of mouth on online social presence. We estimated the mediation impact of epidemic protection and attitude toward epidemic outbreaks on online social presence. The key results showed that the role of e-government and COVID-19 word of mouth positively impacted online social presence. Similarly, epidemic protection and attitude toward epidemic outbreak showed positive mediation impact on online social presence. From estimated results, we outline some implications and policy suggestions: During quarantine, people have more free time to participate in social media, which increases their desire to be present online. For themselves and society, they want to participate in disease protection and to provide suggestions to perform positively during the difficult time caused by COVID-19 quarantine. People can obtain basic information and protection measures from e-government and obtain specifics about the issue. For practical implementations during epidemic outbreaks, the results suggest that the health authorities and government should pay more attention to managing the attitude toward outbreaks and its relationship with the role of e-government. People's perceptions about the government will help build their willingness toward long-term pandemic control.

124560,"The new coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has required the implementation of severe mobility restrictions and social distancing measures worldwide. While these measures have been proven effective in abating the epidemic in several countries, it is important to estimate the effectiveness of testing and tracing strategies to avoid a potential second wave of the COVID-19 epidemic. We integrate highly detailed (anonymized, privacy-enhanced) mobility data from mobile devices, with census and demographic data to build a detailed agent-based model to describe the transmission dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 in the Boston metropolitan area. We find that enforcing strict social distancing followed by a policy based on a robust level of testing, contact-tracing and household quarantine, could keep the disease at a level that does not exceed the capacity of the health care system. Assuming the identification of 50% of the symptomatic infections, and the tracing of 40% of their contacts and households, which corresponds to about 9% of individuals quarantined, the ensuing reduction in transmission allows the reopening of economic activities while attaining a manageable impact on the health care system. Our results show that a response system based on enhanced testing and contact tracing can play a major role in relaxing social distancing interventions in the absence of herd immunity against SARS-CoV-2.","The new coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has required the implementation of severe mobility restrictions and social distancing measures worldwide.<q>While these measures have been proven effective in abating the epidemic in several countries, it is important to estimate the effectiveness of testing and tracing strategies to avoid a potential second wave of the COVID-19 epidemic.<q>We find that enforcing strict social distancing followed by a policy based on a robust level of testing, contact-tracing and household quarantine, could keep the disease at a level that does not exceed the capacity of the health care system.

Since its identification in late December 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei Province, People’s Republic of China, the number of cases imported into other countries is increasing, and the epidemiological map is changing rapidly. On the other hand, body temperature screening (fever) is the major test performed at points of entry, i.e., airports, in the returning travelers in most of the countries with limited resources. However, the recent report on asymptomatic contact transmission of COVID-19 and travelers who passed the symptoms-based screening and tested positive for COVID-19 using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) challenges this approach as body temperature screening may miss travelers incubating the disease or travelers concealing fever during travel. On this note, travel restrictions to and from high risk areas and/or 14 days quarantine of travelers coming from high risk areas are recommended to prevent possible importation of COVID-19. Currently, RT-PCR is a reliable test in detecting both symptomatic and asymptomatic COVID-19.","On Thursday, 30 January 2020, World Health Organization declared Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-2019) a Public Health Emergency of International Concern.<q>Since its identification in late December 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei Province, People’s Republic of China, the number of cases imported into other countries is increasing, and the epidemiological map is changing rapidly.<q>On this note, travel restrictions to and from high risk areas and/or 14 days quarantine of travelers coming from high risk areas are recommended to prevent possible importation of COVID-19.

125919,"The results and related discussions reported in this section regard the data collected through a questionnaire submitted from 15 March to 20 March 2020 to ILI and ILA. Moreover, a further analysis of the results distinguishing ILI-MAR and ILI-LAR was carried out in order to highlight possible differences in risk perceptions related to COVID-19 in Italy. This work provided preliminary insights, which might support decision makers to face future sanitary emergencies, by investigating the public perception of health risk of COVID-19 in Italy. To this purpose, a questionnaire was designed and, consequently, administered within the period of lockdown and quarantine in Italy to almost 9000 Italians living in Italy (ILI) and abroad (ILA). The investigated aspects regarded the level of acceptance and the level of knowledge, as well as some effects of this public health emergency to the feelings, concerns, and behaviors of ILI and ILA. Notably, it is worthy to report that the higher the level of knowledge regarding the Italian situation, the higher the uncertainty perceived by the respondents, as well as the level of acceptance of the mitigation measures. Probably, the better awareness about this complex and hazardous situation leads people to be more uncertain and to accept more strict mitigation measures, such as lockdown and quarantine. Moreover, some differences emerged between the responses of Italians living in more affected regions (ILI-MAR) and Italians living in less affected regions (ILI-LAR). As reported within the study, another aspect influencing the perception of the respondents regards the main mass media (such as television, social networks, and newspapers) adopted to collect information about the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in Italy. Generally, interviewees who used newspapers as a main source of information, in particular ILI-MAR, were more aware about the COVID-19 pandemic in Italy. On the contrary, it would seem that the prevalent use of television and social networks, in particular among ILI-LAR, contributes to a lower level of knowledge and to elicit a prevalent state of fear in individuals. This study confirms the key role of mass media on the risk perception, level of knowledge regarding the emergency situation, the level of acceptance of mitigation measures, and the perceived feelings by the Italian population. Consequently, the diffusion of fake news and misleading information may result in an incorrect perception of risk. For this reason, governments should implement measures to face with this issue as the Italian Government has already began to do. However, it is a tricky topic since these measures can limit the freedom of expression guaranteed by the national and international legislations. Finally, first insights about the perceived future effects of Italian population caused by the outbreak were given. In detail, analyzing data regarding the variation of interpersonal distances, it seems that the spread of the virus in Italy could cause a change of Italian cultural behaviors, e.g., varying such distances. However, there is the need to further investigate such potential variations, inasmuch as there is no evidence that perceived changes in patterns of behaviors will be permanent.

126477,"A novel Coronavirus, 2019‐nCoV, has been identified as the causal pathogen of an ongoing epidemic, with the first cases reported in Wuhan, China, last December 2019, and has since spread to other countries worldwide, included Europe and very recently Italy. In this short report, phylogenetic reconstruction was used to better understand the transmission dynamics of the virus from its first introduction in China focusing on the more recent evidence of infection in a couple of Chinese tourists arrived in Italy on 23rd January 2020 and labeled as Coronavirus Italian cases. A maximum clade credibility tree has been built using a dataset of 54 genome sequences of 2019‐nCoV plus two closely related bat strains (SARS‐like CoV) available in GenBank. Bayesian time‐scaled phylogenetic analysis was implemented in BEAST 1.10.4. The Bayesian phylogenetic reconstruction showed that 2019‐2020 nCoV firstly introduced in Wuhan on 25 November 2019, started epidemic transmission reaching many countries worldwide, including Europe and Italy where the two strains isolated dated back 19 January 2020, the same that the Chinese tourists arrived in Italy. Strains isolated outside China were intermixed with strains isolated in China as evidence of likely imported cases in Rome, Italy, and Europe, as well. In conclusion, this report suggests that further spread of 2019‐nCoV epidemic was supported by human mobility and that quarantine of suspected or diagnosed cases is useful to prevent further transmission. Viral genome phylogenetic analysis represents a useful tool for the evaluation of transmission dynamics and preventive action.","A novel Coronavirus, 2019‐nCoV, has been identified as the causal pathogen of an ongoing epidemic, with the first cases reported in Wuhan, China, last December 2019, and has since spread to other countries worldwide, included Europe and very recently Italy.<q>In this short report, phylogenetic reconstruction was used to better understand the transmission dynamics of the virus from its first introduction in China focusing on the more recent evidence of infection in a couple of Chinese tourists arrived in Italy on 23rd January 2020 and labeled as Coronavirus Italian cases.<q>A maximum clade credibility tree has been built using a dataset of 54 genome sequences of 2019‐nCoV plus two closely related bat strains (SARS‐like CoV) available in GenBank.

126652,"According to the report of Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) [2] , by February 11, 2020, there were 44 672 patients diagnosed as Covid-19, the severe type accounted for 19.1% and the mortality rate was 2.3%. In our department, severe type accounted for 53.8% (7/13), and the morality rate was 30.8% (4/13), which was significantly higher than the reported results. Meanwhile, 15.4% (2/13) of the infected health care staff were in severe stage, slightly lower than the reported result. The age, smoking history and comorbidities could all contribute to the different outcome of Covid-19 between patients and health care staff. In our study, we found that chest operation was significantly associated with death in COIVD-19 patients, and COPD is significantly associated with severe Covid-19 and death. Operation would lead to lung function impairment and decreased immunity. These results indicate that SARS-CoV-2 infection is severe after thoracic operations, and could lead to a poor outcome. Liu et al found that CRP, LDH, and lymphocyte count may be predictors of the severity of lung injury [3] . However, there is no significant correlation between the laboratory results and the severity of Covid-19. Jiang et al reported that PCT was increased in Covid-19 patients undergoing thoracic surgery [4] . In our study, an increase of PCT was not observed in Covid-19 patients. The discrepancy may be explained by small sample size. Covid-19 is mainly manifested as fever, accompanied by cough, fatigue, muscular soreness, chest depression, shortness of breath, diarrhea and other symptoms [1] . Postoperative patients may also have fever, cough and chest condition, which should be differentiate from Covid-19. Postoperative infection is mainly due to insufficient drainage and mostly caused by bacteria, commonly occurring 3 to 7 days after operation, accompanied with cough with sputum, elevated WBC count. While most Covid-19 patients had normal or reduced WBC count, and lower lymphocyte count. Early chest CT of Covid-19 shows localized ground glass shadows and interstitial changes, which are mainly in the dorsal or periphery part of the lung [5] . Furthermore, multiple infiltrating shadows and lung consolidation can be seen in both lungs. Pleural effusion is rare in severe cases [6, 7] . Some early Covid-19 may present as single or multiple GGO-like changes, which needs to be identified from lung cancer [8] . Some mild Covid-19 may progress to severe stage within a few days, and repeated chest CT is necessary. SARS-CoV-2 is highly infectious and is susceptible to all populations. Respiratory droplets and contact transmission are the main transmission routes, and aerosol transmission is also possible [1] . Infected patient is the main source of transmission, even in asymptomatic stage. Thoracic surgery requires patients to do respiratory function exercise after operation, including productive cough. Cough training will produce a large A: 38-years-old man, a small patch of mixed GGO was first observed in his right upper lobe, then the lesion was markedly progressed in the extent and density (January 30, 2020), and 12 days later, the lesion was completely absorbed after treatment (February 11, 2020); B: 30-yearsold man, the initial chest CT showed single GGO in his right lower lobe (January 23, 2020), and the first followup CT demonstrated multiple GGOs and extensive consolidations in the bilateral lower lobes. Meanwhile, the patient had normal body temperature without dyspnea (February 2, 2020). After supportive treatments, most of lesions were markedly absorbed, but the RT-PCR test of SARS-CoV-2 was still positive (February 14, 2020); C: 63-year-old man, a patch of pure GGO and subpleural interstitial changes were observed before the operation (January 3, 2020). Multiple patches were found 2 days after the operation (January 19, 2020) and the disease was rapidly progressed, appearing as multiple GGOs with crazy-paving sign and consolidations (January 21, 2020); D: 56-year-old woman, chest CT was normal before the surgery (January 15, 2020). Multiple patches of consolidations and GGOs were found in bilateral lungs (February 7, 2020), indicating a disease progression. Chest X-ray showed ""white lung"" (February 24, 2020) before death. amount of droplets and aerosols to the surrounding space, which can increase efficacy of exposure. To et al [9] found that sputum was an important source of transmission. Therefore, Covid-19 patients are highly contagious in department of thoracic surgery. Tuite et al [10] found that the average basic infection number R0 of SARS-CoV-2 was 2.3 on January 24, 2020, and the effective infection number Re was reduced to 1.5 after effective protective measures were taken on February 3, 2020. Therefore, effective protective measures can reduce R0. However, with daily standard protection equipment, health care staff are highly susceptible to Covid-19 [11] . We suggest thoracic surgeons should delay the selective operation and confine operation, and strictly grasp the indications of emergency operation during the outbreak. Asymptomatic patients should be concerned, and routine blood test, chest CT and SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid examination should be performed before emergency surgery. ""Super spreader"" indicates patient potentially transmits infection to more than 10 people. To our knowledge, no ""super spreader"" has been reported in China yet. Retrospective analysis of 25 cases of Covid-19 in our department revealed 11 SARS-CoV-2 infected cases with traceable exposure history with ""Patient 01"". ""Patient 01"" was a 63-year-old smoking male with lung cancer who had COPD. The preoperative evaluation of lung function is sufficient for lobectomy. Before the operation was performed, his CT image showed a patch opacity in the right lung and interstitial abnormalities in both lungs, the early signs of Covid-19. He was misdiagnosed before operation. Eleven confirmed Covid-19 cases occurred after the operation date of ""Patient 01"", most likely due to aerosol and droplets generated from his cough. Due to insufficient preparation, inappropriate protective measures were implemented at the beginning of outbreak and caused a large number of infection among hospitalized patients and health care staff. Unfortunately, ""Patient 01"" had rapid progression and died from respiratory failure 5 days after operation. He was considered as a ""super spreader"" in the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 infection in our department. In summary, SARS-CoV-2 is highly contagious. Hospitalized patients and health care staff in the epidemic are at high risk of infection. Patients infected with Covid-19 in perioperative period have high risk of death. Therefore, implementing comprehensive protective measures such as quarantine and disinfection are essential to control nosocomial infection.

126933,"As said, one of the aims of the research was to discuss the spread of coronavirus in Italy To investigate the incidence of citizen mobility within the spread of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, the mobility habits trend was preliminary estimated applying the equation (3). As said, through the Official National Monitoring Observatory ""Audimob"" of Isfort (2020), were estimated the mobility rates of the Italian ""active population"" (14-80 year-old population) before and during the national lockdown (as imposed by DPCM of 8 March 2020). Before the COVID-19, within the 14-80 year-old Italian population, 38 million residents (80% of the total) made at least one trip per day, while after the lockdown ordinance (DPCM, 8 March 2020) a significant reduction in mobility habits was observed and in few days a reduction to about 18 million people trips/day was observed (-42%). The estimates for the period before COVID-19 were used to evaluate the ADMR t rate, while those made in the first lockdown period (8 March 2020) were used to validate the %Var t,i estimates. Results in term of daily mobility rates performed by Isfort (2020) J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f significant in regions in central Italy (-51%), and less marked in the southern regions and the islands (-36%), while the northern regions fell just below the national average (-42%). As regards the age of the interviewees, starting from the restrictions the collapse in mobility was clear, especially among the over-65s where it fell by three-quarters: fewer than 15% of citizens made at least one trip by private or public transport during the lockdown. The reduction in the mobility rate was also striking among the young and very young, where the majority are schoolchildren or university students. Looking at the employment status of the interviewees, the mobility rate during the lockdown was still around 50% among workers (a little higher among employees than the self-employed), who recorded a 35% decrease in trips, just 5-7 points below the general 2 average. On the other hand, the trips of retirees were almost eliminated: their mobility rate fell from 66% pre-COVID-19 to 16% under lockdown. There was also a very marked reduction in J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f student mobility (from 73% to 26%), which was of course massively affected by school closures (DPCM of 9 March 2020). For each of the 20 Italian regions, the 14-80 year-old population mobility habits and its day by day evolution before, during and after (beginning of business recovery ""Phase 2"") the COVID-19 pandemic in Italy was therefore estimated through the equation (3) found.) show that the estimated mobility habits trend is consistent with those of the available databases, in addition to those of the Isfort (2020) investigation. The research discussed in this paper concerns the topics of both the ""atmosphere"" (air quality and temperature impacts) and the ""anthroposphere"", in the sense of the Earth's research area dealing with the part of the environment that is made or modified to satisfy human activities and habits, where transportation system and the corresponding people mobility trips cover a central role. Precisely, the aim of the paper was to investigate the incidence of citizens' mobility habits within the spread of the Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic for the Italian case study. The conjecture that the number of new certified cases of coronavirus in one day is directly related to the number of trips made several days before, in addition to environmental and other context factors, was investigated. Another issue discussed in this paper and unexplored in the literature is the appropriate definition and estimation of the positivity detection time and its correlation with mobility habits. The thesis was that this time period generally exceeds the incubation time due to many external factors such as false negative test results to COVID-19 or people who, albeit infected, are asymptomatic and/or initially show only mild symptoms, and therefore do not resort to health care. To pursue the research aims, quantitative estimation was made through a multiple linear regression model.

127119,"This paper reports on a case series of BPD triggered by psychological distress derived from the current COVID-19 pandemic. Other authors have reported cases similar to ours, and it is likely that this could be a generalized phenomenon in countries severely affected by the coronavirus pandemic 6 . Thus, these exceptional circumstances being experienced around the world could lead to a significant increase in the incidence of psychotic disorders. In fact, there is already preliminary evidence in this respect in China, the country where the pandemic originated, and where an increase in the number of cases of first-episode schizophrenia has been observed in the months since the outbreak of COVID-19 8 . The current pandemic, as other public health crises recently experienced, such as the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) or Ebola, is leading to negative psychological effects in the population, not just because of fear of infection, but usually also because of the Government implementation of isolation and quarantine measures to avoid the spread of the disease 9 . Such imposed home confinement restricts the freedom, routines and rhythm of conventional life and involves forced separation from family and friends that causes an increase in uncertainty about the unknown, as well as an overall feeling of loss of control 9 . The fear of stigmatization and financial loss may substantially enhance this emotional distress in the population 9 . Moreover, in today's age of digital information and social networks, the proliferation of fake news and conspiracy theories would contribute even further to increasing worry and social alarm 6 . This acutely stressful scenario could play a relevant role in the genesis of new-onset psychoses and might also be an important risk factor for clinical decompensation in individuals with previous psychotic disorders 10 . The relationship between adult life events and subsequent 7 onset of psychosis has received little attention by researchers, although meta-analytical evidence suggests around a threefold increase in risk of psychosis in those experiencing stressful events 11 . The presence of these adverse psychosocial factors is also associated with higher frequency in the development of brief psychotic disorders than with schizophrenia or affective psychosis 1 . Along this line, emotional reactivity to stress constitutes the substrate underlying the concept of brief reactive psychosis 1 . Thus, in keeping with stress-diathesis models 12 , the emergence of psychotic symptoms in these individuals with reactive psychosis might be associated not only with the acute stress related to the COVID-19 crisis (which would act as a stressor or state-dependent characteristic) but also with preexisting psychological or biological abnormalities (that would act as susceptibility or trait-like diathesis). With regard to the description above, it should be noted that the increased emotional reactivity observed in individuals with brief reactive psychosis could also render them more vulnerable to impulsive behavior and lead to suicidal ideation when they must deal with highly stressful events such as the COVID-19 pandemic. In this vein, acute stress has been significantly associated with an increase in risk of suicide in persons with short-lived psychotic disorders 13 , and suicidal behavior has also been reported under forced quarantine similar to what we are now experiencing 9 . Therefore, it is paramount to assess suicidal symptoms in this population with brief reactive psychosis, especially in emergency settings where this task can often be passed over because of the rapidly changing psychopathology in such clinical cases 12 . Other important points to keep in mind are the risk of recurrence and the diagnostic instability of such short-lived psychotic disorders 14 . Although brief reactive psychoses have traditionally been considered clinical conditions with good prognosis, in almost half of such cases, their evolution over time is toward severe mental disorders, mostly schizophrenia or, to a lesser extent, bipolar disorder 1, 14 . The presence of hallucinations and schizophreniform symptomatology at the onset of psychosis, as well as later relapse, are factors associated with an increased risk of developing chronic psychotic disorders during follow-up 15, 16 . Moreover, long hospitalizations and the prescription of high dosages of antipsychotic medication seem to be predictors of poor prognosis in these short-lived psychotic disorders 17, 18 . It would therefore be J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 8 necessary to prepare preventive approaches and close follow-up of this population with reactive psychosis when the COVID-19 crisis has ended, due to the abovementioned risk of recurrences and transition to long-lasting psychotic disorders of these individuals. Summarizing, we conclude that the current COVID-19 pandemic and the mandatory nationwide quarantine enforced by authorities to control spread of the virus constitute a risk factor for the development of reactive psychoses. Such psychotic conditions are associated with a high risk of suicide, high rate of relapse and low diagnostic stability, making close clinical monitoring necessary in both the acute phase and in long-term follow-up.

128113,"There are several uncertainties as to how we will conduct these clinical, didactic, business and social activities as this COVID-19 global pandemic abates and social distancing guidelines are relaxed. We anticipate changes in the way we interact with our patients and other providers, the way we design patient workflow, the way we conduct our teaching sessions and, how we perform procedures in different clinical settings. The objective of this paper is to review some of the changes to consider in clinical and academic oral and maxillofacial surgery workflow to make this transition smoother, efficient, and less risky for our patients and health care personnel. New infection control policies should be strictly enforced and monitored in all clinical and non-clinical settings, with an overall goal to decrease the risk of exposure and transmission. Screening for Covid-19 symptoms, testing when indicated, and, establishing epidemiologic linkage, will be crucial to contain and prevent new COVID-19 cases until there is a vaccine or an alternate solution. Additionally, we will have to take into consideration the shortage of essential supplies such as drugs, personal protective equipment (PPE), the design and ventilation of workspaces and waiting areas, increase in overhead costs and possible absence of staff, if quarantine is necessary. This shift in our workflow and patient care paths is likely to continue in the short-term at least through 2021 or next 12-24 months. We have to prioritize surgery balancing patient preferences and healthcare personnel risks. We have an opportunity now to make changes and embrace telemedicine and other collaborative virtual platforms for teaching and clinical care.

128693,"Large families, including three-generation families in a single dwelling, should be monitored when the index case is found. Presymptomatic and symptomatic family members could be quarantined for an appropriate duration which, in our experience, is 2 months. Keywords: COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, family cluster, prolonged quarantine Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) became a pandemic in 2020 1 . Severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) transmits via social activity of family, friends, and co-workers 2, 3 . Families are a transmission route for SARS-CoV-2 because of close contact 4 . The current public policy is quarantine for at least 14 days, based on the incubation period 5 or until the patient has tested negative three days in a row using the SARS-CoV-2 reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Monitoring the viral load will be a valuable method to reduce the optimal quarantine days, especially in asymptomatic carriers 6 . Identifying asymptomatic carriers within a family is important to guide quarantine policy 7 . In East Asia, grandparents, parents, and children living together is a common tradition, a pattern also seen in Taiwan 8 . Our study aimed to investigate a three-generation family cluster of COVID-19. We report a family cluster with six individuals infected with COVID-19 in Taiwan. Details on the onset date of clinical symptoms, throat swab conversion, and course of disease were collected from medical records retrospectively. The household cluster with COVID-19 infection status is summarized in Table 1 and Supplemental Figure 1 In the household of this three-generation Taiwanese family, the infection rate was 60%. The probable cause of transmission would be normal family interaction, such as taking care of older family members and routine visits. The ratio of males to females was 4:2, and the age range was 11-85 years. The prevalence of asymptomatic disease was 33.3% (2/6). Our report shows that the youngest asymptomatic case had shorter throat swab conversion time and disease course. In contrast, elderly family members may experience severe pneumonia, particularly with comorbid diseases, and death 9 . Elder patients had longer throat swab conversion and prolonged potential quarantine duration even after symptoms had improved. This highly contagious disease, when found in a traditional family structure, transmits to other household members of different ages and has the potential to infect all family members. If there is an insufficient quarantine period, the grandparents with pneumonia who are admitted to the hospital could be the source of nosocomial infection, and the parents will then transmit it to their colleagues. In Taiwan, a high attack rate was observed within 5 days of detection of a symptomatic index case than observed >5 days 10 . The attack rate was higher among household family contacts than that in health care settings. Presymptomatic and symptomatic patients have a risk of transmission to their family, as per epidemiologic studies in Taiwan. In our report, the longest throat swab conversion was 5 weeks, and the disease course was 2 months. This case only includes 6 individuals, which limits efficient external validity of the results. However, three generations family clusters may be a strong transmission factor of COVID-19 in East Asia countries, as different from that of Western countries. The possibility of different living arrangements being a factor in the transmission of COVID-19 is a topic that should be studied in the future. We propose three practical policies. First, if the index case was found, immediate examination of three generations of family members, especially if they live together, should be conducted. Second, presymptomatic and symptomatic family members could be quarantined at hotels with suitable social distance or be isolated at the hospital until their three sequential throat swabs show negative results. Finally, the effective quarantine duration remains a mystery. In our experience, the possible duration would be 2 months.

128833,"As there is no vaccination and proper medicine for treatment, the recent pandemic caused by COVID-19 has drawn attention to the strategies of quarantine and other governmental measures, like lockdown, media coverage on social isolation, and improvement of public hygiene, etc to control the disease. The mathematical model can help when these intervention measures are the best strategies for disease control as well as how they might affect the disease dynamics. Motivated by this, in this article, we have formulated a mathematical model introducing a quarantine class and governmental intervention measures to mitigate disease transmission. We study a thorough dynamical behavior of the model in terms of the basic reproduction number. Further, we perform the sensitivity analysis of the essential reproduction number and found that reducing the contact of exposed and susceptible humans is the most critical factor in achieving disease control. To lessen the infected individuals as well as to minimize the cost of implementing government control measures, we formulate an optimal control problem, and optimal control is determined. Finally, we forecast a short-term trend of COVID-19 for the three highly affected states, Maharashtra, Delhi, and Tamil Nadu, in India, and it suggests that the first two states need further monitoring of control measures to reduce the contact of exposed and susceptible humans.","We study a thorough dynamical behavior of the model in terms of the basic reproduction number.<q>To lessen the infected individuals as well as to minimize the cost of implementing government control measures, we formulate an optimal control problem, and optimal control is determined.<q>Further, we perform the sensitivity analysis of the essential reproduction number and found that reducing the contact of exposed and susceptible humans is the most critical factor in achieving disease control.

129502,"This study comprehensively discussed the short-term impact of the COVID-19 on the Chinese environment from the perspective of time and space. The main conclusions of this paper are as follows. (1) The outbreak of COVID-19 improved China's air quality in the short term and significantly contributed to global carbon emissions reduction. From the time dimension, China's energy consumption dropped sharply during the outbreak of COVID-19, especially the total coal consumption. And COVID-19 effectively suppressed the GHG emissions such as CO 2 . However, the observed data indicate that this beneficial effect only occurs during quarantine. As some regions in China lifted the lockdown and enterprises resumed production, people and goods began to flow on a large scale. Meanwhile, declining energy consumption is showing an upward trend, and traffic congestion is gradually returning to the level before quarantine. It can be deduced from this that when China completely lifts the lockdown and resumes production, its energy use and GHG emissions are likely to exceed the level before the outbreak. (2) The COVID-19 significantly reduces the concentration of NO 2 in the atmosphere. This reduction initially occurred near Wuhan and eventually spread to the whole country. From a spatial perspective, the reduction of environmental pollutants initially appeared in areas with severe epidemics because they firstly implemented strict restrictions. Subsequently, more and more regions adopted quarantine measures and implemented traffic control. As a result, the air quality throughout the country improved significantly. This phenomenon seems to imply a close correlation between the economy and environmental pollution. The reduction in economic activities and traffic restrictions directly affects the changes in China's energy consumption, and effectively reduce the generation of environmental pollution. (3) This study enriches the theoretical research on economic and environmental pollution in the context of extreme events. The COVID-19 outbreak in 2020 is an extreme event and a global emergency public health event. The systematic analysis of the relationship between economic growth and environmental pollution during the outbreak can not only provide a reference for other countries to assess the impact of COVID-19 on the environment, but also enrich the theoretical research on the relationship between economy and pollution from an emergency-economyenvironment perspective.

129645,"Our primary findings demonstrate that (a) COVID-19 anxiety was associated with PSU severity and (b) COVID-19 anxiety mediated relations between predisposing general anxiety with PSU severity. However, when adjusting for general anxiety and depression on PSU, only general anxiety (but not COVID-19 anxiety) was significantly related to PSU severity. We found possible prevalence of at least moderate anxiety in 24% of participants, and at least moderate depression in 12% of participants. These findings roughly correspond to other COVID-19 community estimates, ranging from 23-28% for moderate anxiety and 17-48% for moderate depression Wang et al., 2020) . Results on anxiety and depression prevalence in other countries affected by COVID-19 should become available in the near future. Supporting H1, we discovered that COVID-19 anxiety was associated with PSU severity in bivariate analyses and SEM using our hypothesized Research Model. Anxiety correlates with PSU severity across the literature (Elhai et al., 2019a; . The relationship between COVID-19 anxiety with PSU severity fits with the I-PACE conceptualization of responses to environmental stressors driving excessive internet use to alleviate negative emotion (Brand et al., 2019; Brand et al., 2016) . Thus, in order to manage anxiety from COVID-19 and associated social isolation, especially in light of home quarantine and absence of numerous other activities, many people may engage in PSU. In fact, research shows that social isolation particularly influences negative affectivity (Hawkley and Cacioppo, 2010; Leigh-Hunt et al., 2017) . In our revised SEM, however, when adding and controlling for general anxiety and depression as predictors of PSU severity, COVID-19 anxiety no longer related to PSU. Thus while COVID-19 anxiety on its own (in SEM) was significantly related to PSU severity, controlling for general anxiety and depression rendered this relationship nonsignificant. Despite significant concerns about COVID-19, people have other everydaylife worries and anxiety (captured by our general anxiety assessment) that have not ceased, but probably increased, with COVID-19's onset. For example, everyday anxiety involving social and intimate relationship formation and maintenance (Lindesay et al., 2006) would naturally exacerbate with home quarantine , and increase the fear of missing out on rewarding experiences (Elhai et al., 2020b; Elhai et al., in press-b) . Similarly, existing anxiety regarding finances, employment, and economic stability (Lindesay et al., 2006) have risen because of the economic toll of the COVID-19 pandemic (Pew Research Center, 2020). Such everyday anxieties, exacerbated because of the outbreak, may supercede COVID-19-specific anxiety, especially in low mortality risk COVID-19 groups, resulting in adverse outcomes such as PSU. But, specifically fearing death from COVID-19 (from medical vulnerability, or excessive worry) may especially result in greater PSU severity to alleviate negative emotion, consistent with our findings from bivariate and SEM models. It is plausible that a feedback loop may operate, whereby people manage their COVID-19 anxiety by excessively using their smartphones, but in-so-ng inadvertently learn more about COVID-19 from news, further fueling their anxiety and increased smartphone use. In fact, more frequent social media exposure to COVID-19 has been shown to be positively associated with anxiety symptoms . However, contrary to such a feedback loop, we did not find COVID-19 news exposure related to PSU severity. People likely use many other features of their smartphones to cope with negative emotion from COVID-19, including non-social features such as entertainment from TV and movies (Kang et al., 2020, March 26) , even though increased non-social smartphone use is most related to PSU severity (Elhai et al., 2020a; Elhai et al., 2017) . These findings are comparable to findings on anxiety resulting from social media use during prior recent pandemics (discussed in Taylor, 2019, pp. 74-76) COVID-19 anxiety was bivariately related to general anxiety and depression severity, consistent with H2 and Ahorsu et al. (in press ), but only related to general anxiety in our SEM models. These findings generally fit with the I-PACE conceptualization of psychopathology, such as anxiety and depression influencing excessive internet/smartphone use. In fact, anxiety and worry are known to cause greater anxiety from a viral outbreak (Asmundson and Taylor, 2020a; Taylor, 2019) , especially among those with health anxiety misinterpreting physical sensations as viral symptoms (Asmundson and Taylor, 2020b) . Therefore, people with pre-existing anxiety in particular may excessively worry about COVID-19, driving overwhelming demand for medical services and hospital beds (Asmundson and Taylor, 2020a) . Achieving the right balance between promoting social distancing but not excessive worry is clearly important. We discovered that COVID-19 anxiety mediated relations between general anxiety and PSU severity in our hypothesized Research Model, supporting H3. This finding is consistent with the I-PACE conceptualization of affective/cognitive responses (including responses to environmental stressors) as mechanisms explaining the psychopathology-excessive internet use relationship (Brand et al., 2019; Brand et al., 2016) . Prior work supports this conceptualization for affective/cognitive responses (e.g., Elhai et al., in press-a; Wegmann et al., 2017; Wolniewicz et al., 2020) . However, mediation results were not supported for depression in the hypothesized model, nor for either psychopathology predictor in the revised SEM. The research reported in our paper has several limitations. We used a convenience sample from only one large city in China. Because of quarantine, we were unable to interview participants in-person; therefore, we were limited to online selfreport scales, while structured diagnostic interviews would be more accurate. Relevantly, we used self-reported problematic smartphone use, while objective measurement is more accurate (Ryding and Kuss, 2020) . Additionally, our data were collected cross-sectionally and, therefore, causal interpretations cannot be confidently made. Nonetheless, our results provide initial data on mental health status of people affected by COVID-19, and relations between COVID-19 anxiety with PSU severity as a coping mechanism. These results provide a foundation from which we and other researchers can pursue further investigation of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on smartphone use generally and in the context of developing strategies to reduce COVID-19-related PSU in particular.

129850,"Bats have been recognized as a natural reservoir and vectors of a variety of coronaviruses, and these viruses have crossed species barriers to infect humans and many different kinds of animals, including avians, rodents, and chiropters [83 , 84] . While the origin of COVID-19 is still being investigated, COVID-19 has features typical of the Coronaviridae family and was classified in the beta-coronavirus 2b lineage. COVID-19 can be transmitted between humans. Interventions, including intensive contact tracing followed by quarantine and isolation, can effectively reduce the spread of COVID-19, with the effect of travel restrictions. Wearing masks, washing hands and disinfecting surfaces contribute to reducing the risk of infection. Human coronaviruses can be efficiently inactivated within 1 min using surface disinfection procedures with 62-71% ethanol, 0.5% hydrogen peroxide or 0.1% sodium hypochlorite [85] . Identification of the causative viral pathogens of respiratory tract viral infections is important to select an appropriate treatment, control the pandemic, and reduce the economic impact of COVID-19 on China and the world. In acute respiratory infection, RT-PCR is routinely used to detect causative viruses from respiratory secretions. The positive rate of PCR from oropharyngeal swabs is not very high. In this situation, more swab testing is needed to clarify diagnosis. Typical CT findings can help early screening of suspected cases and diagnosis of COVID-19. The COVID-19 infection has a clustering onset and is more likely to affect older males (average age 51 years) with comorbidities [86] . No evidence supports adverse birth outcomes, intrauterine infection, or vertical transmission of COVID-19 [87] . However, viral infections can be acquired when the infant passes through the birth canal during vaginal delivery or through postpartum breastfeeding [88] . The most common symptoms were fever, cough, expectoration, headache, myalgia or fatigue, diarrhea, and hemoptysis [89] . Some people may experience severe acute respiratory distress syndrome. Histological examination of lung biopsy samples showed bilateral diffuse alveolar damage with cellular fibromyxoid exudates [90] . Other organs are also susceptible to COVID-19. The single-cell RNA-seq data was used to analyse receptor ACE2 expression to reveal the potential risk of different human organs to COVID-19 infection [91] . COVID-19 uses the same cell entry receptor as SARS-CoV, ACE2, which regulates both cross-species and human-to-human transmissions [80] . Proximal tubular cells also express higher levels of the ACE2 receptor, which leads to susceptibility to COVID-19 [91] and induces kidney injury. Data from 33 patients with a complete clinical course were analysed, and the levels of blood urea and creatinine were higher in non-survivors than in survivors [92] . All patients with COVID-19-infected pneumonia received antibacterial agents, 90% received antiviral therapy, and 45% received methylprednisolone [92] . Clinical trials are underway to investigate the efficacy of new antiviral drugs, convalescent plasma transfusion, and vaccines. Most of the trials were initiated by investigators and the study period is 1 to 11 months. Although the final results of these studies will take a long time to complete, the interim research data may provide some help for the current urgent demand for therapy [93] . The COVID-19 pandemic is a public health emergency of international concern, and all countries need a coordinated international effort to fight COVID-19. The transmission of pneumonia associated with SARS-CoV-2 has not yet been eliminated. In the absence of vaccines and antivirals, isolation and quarantine are achieving remarkable results. It is necessary to strengthen the monitoring of COVID-19 and to develop drugs and vaccines against the COVID-19 infection as soon as possible.

130030,"In this study, the MH parameter optimization algorithm and an improved SEIR model was used to predict the epidemic spreading trends in six African countries (South Africa, countries are likely to be quickly curbed with finite infected. Fortunately, the South Africa and Senegal are in line with this scenario. If the response speed of the governments to take prevention measures is slow and there are loopholes in the intervention measures (such as lower testing rate), the spread of the epidemic may meet the second scenario (mitigation) and the basically control time will be delayed by about 10 days by comparison with the first scenario. The results showed that Algeria, Nigeria and Kenya are adopted the palliative measures, and the curves are accord with this scenario. By comparison, the third scenario (mildness) is the worst, with the outbreak being basically contained in late May, when the number of infections doubled. Presently, the changes of the epidemic spread in Egypt is similar to the third scenario, so it is necessary to timely adjust the strategies to make the curve as close as possible to the second scenario. Besides, the epidemic will be probably uncontrolled without the rapid public health response, along with the poor awareness of the disease, insufficient prevention and control measures, and the lack of self-protection awareness. Although the relevant national departments (such as Egypt) have issued strict prevention and control measures, the containing effects on the spread of the virus are not significant according to the simulation and prediction results. Therefore, stronger, earlier interventions and a sense of public self-protection will be the essential measures to fight this disaster (John et al., 2020) . It should be pointed out that this prediction is a conservative estimate under the condition of the uncertainty of the data (such as low testing rate).

130597,"""All models are wrong, but some are useful"". This famous statement, attributed to the statistician George Box, sums up the usefulness of our model. Although it is not possible to predict the exact number of infected individuals, the model allows describing, in a qualitative way, the influence that different measures can have to mitigate the spreading of the coronavirus during a sports competition. In that sense, we first investigated the effects of reducing the number of days between matches. Interestingly, we observed that this fact resulted in a substantial reduction in the number of infected players at the end of the season (see Fig. 2A ). This result could seem counterintuitive, since reducing the frequency of matches would promote the spreading speed of the coronavirus between teams. However, the fact that the season would be more compressed also results in a reduction of the exposure time to external infections, being the latter a factor with a major influence on the final number of infected players. Next, we investigated the consequences of modifying the number of days between PCR tests. Let us remark that antibody and antigen tests should be ruled out in this context because they are not effective until the disease is well advanced. As expected, we observed that the tests should be as accurate as possible and should be carried out continuously along with the competition, with the optimum scenario being one test per day (see Figs. 2B-D). The analysis of the statistical behaviour of the numerical results yields that, in spite of the complexity of the model, the system at the end of the season can be described as a compound Poisson process (see Fig. 3 ). Regarding the large unpredictability associated to it we conclude that, while qualitative results are clear and lead to behaviour strategies easy to follow by the sports organizations, obtaining precise predictions for a single realisation -the real case-is not possible. This is in agreement with recent work that warns about the strong sensitivity to parameter values in epidemics modelling [24] . We must also note that applying all the measures suggested by the model involves a cost. On the one hand, reducing the time between matches can be very physically demanding. The recovery time after a match would be reduced and the risk of injury would increase. To reduce this risk, teams should increase player rotations. Regarding the tests, football clubs should provide the necessary support and means to carry out such a high number of tests in such a short time. Without an adequate policy in this regard, the risk of reinfection in a competition would skyrocket. Players will also pay a personal cost to control the eventual spreading of coronavirus. Minimising their contacts with other individuals would mean limiting their travels, public events and, in general, reducing interactions with people outside the family environment. In fact, maintaining them in confinement during the rest of the season would be obviously the optimum situation. Finally, although the results shown here are focused on the resumption of the men's Spanish national league, the conclusions are equally valid for the women's competition. Furthermore, the model could be adapted to any competition in which matches involve some physical contact between players, such as basketball, handball or rugby. ","Although it is not possible to predict the exact number of infected individuals, the model allows describing, in a qualitative way, the influence that different measures can have to mitigate the spreading of the coronavirus during a sports competition.<q>In that sense, we first investigated the effects of reducing the number of days between matches.<q>""All models are wrong, but some are useful"".

131531,"China's containment effort has strikingly curtailed morbidity and mortality from COVID-19 and stopped community transmission of SARS-CoV-2. At the same time, almost the entire Chinese population remains susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 and is dependent on public health measures for protection, while vaccines, treatments, and minimally intrusive suppression measures are being developed for long-term prevention and control. The successful containment effort builds confidence in China, based on experience and knowledge gained, that future waves of COVID-19 can be stopped, if not prevented. Case identification and management, coupled with identification and quarantine of close contacts, is a strategy that works. Other countries that successfully contained COVID-19 with case and close-contact identification and management include Iceland, Mongolia, Singapore, South Korea, and Vietnam. Singapore maximised detection of suspected patients through a public prevention clinic network and tightly implemented, legally supported home quarantine orders for patients with mild illness. 60 South Korea greatly expanded the scope of testing to detect cases as early as possible. 61 More than 600 screening sites capable of taking SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid tests were established, including public health-care clinics, drive-through centres, and walk-in screening sites. Across South Korea, more than 15 000 screening tests could be done in a day. Based on the triage system, patients with mild COVID-19, particularly those younger than 50 years, were instructed to stay in designated places or remain home instead of hospitals. Additional measures included suspension of classes, lockdowns of serious outbreak areas, and banning of gatherings. 61 The core intervention in these countries has been timely detection and management of suspected and confirmed cases and identification and management of their close contacts. An alternative to containment and suppression is mitigation, which seeks to reduce health effects and decrease the epidemic peak by protecting vulnerable populations and avoiding overwhelming the health-care system, thereby slowing and reducing transmission. Core interventions are focused on treatment of severe cases and implementing NPIs, rather than optimising detection and management of every case and close contact. With mitigation, mild cases can go undetected and serve as sources of infection, supporting community transmission. Mitigation might allow development of herd immunity over a long time, but at a great cost in terms of number of cases, morbidity, and mortality. 37 Experience with influenza A is that NPIs (without case finding, isolation, and contact tracing) can reduce spread by up to 50%, 62 which is potentially insufficient to alleviate critical medical needs caused by the COVID-19 epidemic. 37 With ongoing virus transmission, the COVID-19 pandemic might continue indefinitely until relieved by an effective vaccine response. In summary, we are now facing a totally new, extraordinarily complex, and highly damaging virus. Countries are in different phases of the epidemic: early stage, plateau phase, or having just gained first-phase victory but facing additional waves from imported cases. Countries need to implement measures tailored to epidemiological circumstances and system capacities, but successful practices in several countries, including China, Singapore, and South Korea, show that-at the individual level-identification and management of infected people and their close contacts are practices that work. 37, 60, 61 WHO is committed to providing technical leadership supporting Member State implementation of the International Health Regulations and innovation to refine evidence-based prevention and control strategies for COVID-19. We have a firm belief that through international collaboration, sharing, and innovation, and with UN leadership, the trajectory of this pandemic can be changed for the better.

The first cluster was cases 19 to 23. The infectious source was a Taiwanese passenger from Zhejiang. The second cluster was cases 24 to 26 and the third cluster was cases 27 to 32. The infectious sources of the latter clusters are currently uncertain. All contacts of three clusters have been isolated and no new confirmed cases have been identified to date. Some measures which have reduced the spread of these three clusters included: First, high suspicion of COVID‐19 for unexplained pneumonia is very important for early detection. Second, immediate epidemic investigation is taken especially COVID‐19 is infectious during the incubation period. Third, when the second and third clusters could not find infectious sources, CECC's press conference let the public know immediately the epidemic situation, so that people could raise their awareness and seek medical treatment or quarantine.","Since the first case of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) was identified in Taiwan 2020.<q>This study aimed to report family cluster infections and observe subsequent development.<q>The first cluster was cases 19 to 23.

131793,"Medical outcomes included cumulative incidence, cumulative mortality, and number of ICU beds needed.   ()   .   To our knowledge, this is the first study to propose an agent-based microsimulation model of the epidemic of COVID-19 in New York City to predict the potential impact of quarantine duration (from 4 to 16 weeks), the type of quarantine lifting (1-step lifting for all individuals versus a 2-step lifting according to age), post-quarantine screening of all symptomatic individuals, and the use of a hypothetical effective treatment against COVID-19, on the disease's cumulative incidence and mortality, and on the number of ICU beds needed. The variation of each model parameter value by ±20% had limited impact on outcome estimates (i.e., less than 4,000 per 100,000 for incidence and 11 per 100,000 for mortality), suggesting the robustness of our results. We projected that quarantine, while efficient to contain the viral spread, is unable to prevent a rebound of the epidemic once lifted, resulting in a similar, albeit delayed, overwhelming of ICUs. Based on our model, a 2-step quarantine lifting according to age, i.e., a 3-week quarantine period for younger individuals and an additional 8-week quarantine period for older people, would be associated with better outcomes, including a lower cumulative incidence, mortality and number of ICU beds needed, than a 16-week quarantine followed by a lifting for all individuals. An age cut-off of 60 years instead of 70 years did not substantially modify the mortality and incidence, but was associated with a reduced number of ICU beds needed. Although post-quarantine screening of all symptomatic individuals could bring some benefits after a quarantine lifting for all individuals, we found that this strategy may be ineffective after a 2-step quarantine lifting according to age, and potentially deleterious if herd immunity effect does not had sufficient time to be established in the younger population when the quarantine is lifted for the older population. Finally, an effective treatment against COVID-19 would considerably improve the consequences of the epidemic, even more so if ICU capacity is not exceeded.   ()   Our findings reinforce that SARS-CoV-2 infection represents a major public health threat for NYC, as this infection may cause a very high number of deaths, estimated by our model at about 30,000 deaths in this city if no quarantine had been ordered and if ICUs had been overwhelmed. In line with prior work (4, 7, 8) , our findings suggest that quarantine, while an effective strategy to reduce the strain on healthcare systems by delaying the epidemic peak, is unable to prevent a rebound of the epidemic once lifted, regardless of its duration. Importantly, based on our model, we found that a two-step quarantine lifting, i.e., a 3-week quarantine period for individuals aged less than 70 years and an additional 8-week quarantine period for people aged 70 years and over would be associated with better outcomes, including a lower cumulative incidence, mortality, and number of ICU beds needed, than a one-step quarantine lifting for all individuals, even when considering quarantine duration as long as 16 weeks. Furthermore, this strategy may potentially attenuate the severe economic and social consequences that a prolonged quarantine of the full population, including workers, would cause. As previously suggested (51), these results could be explained by the herd immunity effect, i.e., the reduction of the infection as a result of the indirect protection observed in the unimmunized segment of the population in which a large proportion has been infected and therefore immunized (51), as reflected by the predicted flattening of the cumulative incidence curve around 77% of the population with this strategy. Indeed, once the quarantine is lifted for younger healthy individuals in whom the risk of developing severe or critical symptoms or dying from SARS-CoV-2 is the lowest (4), most of them would inevitably -in the absence of a vaccine -become infected and immunized, and could be adequately treated since ICUs are not expected to be overwhelmed, even during the peak incidence. Once most of them are immunized against COVID-19, the herd immunity effect is likely to prevent older adults from becoming infected when the quarantine would be secondarily lifted for them, i.e., 8 weeks later in our scenario. This strategy may prevent the risk of a second epidemic peak in this frailer   ()   .   population, and thus lessen subsequent mortality (4) and higher ICU-bed occupancy. Specifically, based on our model, the cumulative mortality in NYC would be expected to be about 9,350 deaths with this scenario, contrasting with the 29,750 deaths that would have been reached if the quarantine was lifted for all individuals after 16 weeks with no specific postquarantine measures. When considering an alternative age cut-off of 60 years instead of 70 years, our model did not predict a substantial modification of mortality and incidence, but a substantial decrease in the number of ICU beds needed. Although screening and isolation of symptomatic patients and of diagnosed patients' contacts were associated with an attenuation of the epidemic course and a reduced mortality after a one-step 16-week quarantine lifting, this strategy may not prevent ICUs from being overwhelmed and would even be potentially deleterious after a 2-step quarantine lifting according to age. Specifically, in this scenario using a 70-year of age cut-off, this strategy would result in an 18% increase in mortality, probably because it delays the herd immunity effect in the younger population, leading a greater proportion of vulnerable older adults to be exposed to COVID-19. An extension of the quarantine period for the older people until the younger population is largely immunized would probably diminish this increased mortality. These findings may be explained by the assumption in the model and supported by prior studies (41, 52) that asymptomatic undiagnosed patients are responsible for a large hidden epidemic that exacerbates as soon as the confinement ends. Even when a much lower transmission rate was considered in the model for asymptomatic individuals, we found that disease progression persisted. However, the efficacy of this strategy is highly dependent on the assumption of the true diagnosis rate, which will be better estimated once results of large-scale studies using antibody-based tests for COVID-19 become available. Our study has several limitations. First, the model was calibrated on the diagnosis and mortality rates available from the CDC (6). However, we cannot exclude the possibility that   ()   .   these parameters are underestimates. Nevertheless, the observed differences across scenarios remained unchanged overall when considering a much higher and unlikely (26, 41, 42) diagnosis rate of 1 in 10, except for the efficacy of the post-quarantine screening on the course of the epidemic, which was much greater under this assumption, contributing to the robustness of our conclusions. Second, the contact matrix was approximated using multiple assumptions for each type of contact. However, we found that the model calibrated well, suggesting that although the assumptions made for unknown parameters, such as the frequency of meeting friends or the number of people met during shopping, can be criticized, the overall model, for which most parameter values were based on prior findings (eTable 1), may adequately predict the course of the COVID-19 epidemic in NYC. Third, we considered that infected people could develop immunity for at least several months following standard assumptions (53) . However, post-COVID-19 immunity length remains unknown (54) . Fourth, although the main differences observed were substantial and remained similar to a ±20% variation of each model parameter value, suggesting the generalizability of our results to other locales, future studies using this model and adjusting it to other city's characteristics would be useful to verify this assumption. Finally, as with any simulation model, the results should be interpreted as estimates. SARS-CoV-2 represents a major public health threat in NYC and worldwide. While quarantine is very efficient to contain the viral spread, we projected that it is insufficient to prevent a second epidemic peak once lifted. However, we found that a two-step quarantine lifting according to age was associated with a substantially lower cumulative mortality and incidence, up to 71% and 23%, respectively, as well as lower ICU-bed occupancy, than lifting quarantine in a single step for the full population. Although the post-quarantine screening was associated with a diminished epidemic rebound, our findings suggest that this strategy may not prevent ICUs from being overcrowded and may even become potentially deleterious after a 2step quarantine lifting according to age if herd immunity effect does not had sufficient time to   ()   .   be established in the younger population when the quarantine is lifted for the older population. We hope that this model, the source code for which is publicly available, will be helpful to policy makers who face this devastating epidemic, and that the model will provide a useful framework to researchers to help inform future much-needed studies.

132020,"Covid-19 is a non-orthopaedic disease but is affecting the community of Orthopaedics as much as every part of our daily living. In this Editorial the different aspects of changes in our routine are described, based on the experience of this Editor in Germany. I will try to give you a bit of background information first, as the situation is very much dependent on the specific phase of the pandemic and your place of work. The experience for an Orthopaedic Surgeon in New York or Madrid may differ from that of an Orthopaedic Surgeon in Singapore, or South Korea. As Europe is, at least at the moment, the most affected continent, it hopefully is an interesting topic for all of you. The Covid-19 pandemic is affecting all aspects of our lives, therefore this editorial is divided into 4 sessions: Role as surgeon, as doctor, as teacher, and as family member. Most countries have stopped elective surgeries and by that relegated Orthopaedic surgeons to a minimum of work. Keeping contact to patients with digital tools might be an option to achieve an organised restart after the end of the lock down period and to keep treating patients through that phase. For many Orthopaedic surgeons, the principal task now is being part of an interdisciplinary team that is headed by colleagues from Internal Medicine or Anaesthesiology. Wards from the Orthopaedic department are reorganised as quarantine wards for Covid-19 patients. Worldwide all conferences have been cancelled and nobody knows for how long this will continue. Education now has become fully digital, allowing to present and communicate without real limitations compared to conventional conferences. Some teaching options, such as hands-on workshops, fellowships, etc. are ceased and cannot be replaced by digital options. Due to social distancing families are spending much more time together than before, while some family members, especially the people at risk (elders, ones with a fragile health) cannot be visited for a long time. Get togethers with friends as well as community meetings are completely suspended. For some of them, digital technology is the only option to minimize the problem of social distancing. Overall, it has to be stated, that all parts of our lives as an Orthopaedic Surgeon are affected by the Covid-19 pandemic. As nobody knows how long these restrictions need to remain in place we have to accept them and work on improving this specific situation by following the rules. Hopefully, a vaccine will be developed in the near future, allowing us to return to a “normal” life. Nevertheless, it will never be like it was before.","Covid-19 is a non-orthopaedic disease but is affecting the community of Orthopaedics as much as every part of our daily living.<q>The Covid-19 pandemic is affecting all aspects of our lives, therefore this editorial is divided into 4 sessions: Role as surgeon, as doctor, as teacher, and as family member.<q>In this Editorial the different aspects of changes in our routine are described, based on the experience of this Editor in Germany.

132137,"This study suggests that the COVID-19 epidemic has, before implementation of quarantine measures, affected the number of seniors attending group physical activity programs in the two study territories. This was mostly due to the fear of meeting potentially infected people. Another result of our study is that despite the decline in older adults' participation in group physical activities before the quarantine, they expressed the need to perform physical activity at home. Although quarantine is a measure to protect older adults from COVID-19, staying at home can lead to negative consequences such as reduced physical activity and sedentary behavior. It can also increase the risk of injury due to a lack of adapted equipment or poor knowledge of the physical exercises to perform. Moreover, social ties are essential to encourage older adults to perform physical activity [14] . Reduced social ties for older adults during quarantine could lead to a significant decrease in physical activity. In addition, loneliness could accelerate physical and cognitive decline in older adults [15] . The need for physical activity expressed by older adults raises the question of how older adults can be physically active in the current quarantine period. There is a need to help older adults integrate simple, safe ways to stay physically active in a limited space. A national policy to support older adults for physical activity at home appears essential in this context. In France, based on individuals' initiatives, local structures have sent booklets of physical activity advice and exercises to older adults. There are currently several online physical activity support systems. Some of them are very interesting, such as FFPEVG video clips [16] , the website of the French Ministry of Sports [17] , or the United Kingdom National Health Service guide [18] aiming to encourage older adults to perform physical activity at home. Our study suggests that older adults do not want to use these online tools. Given the results of our study, it seems necessary to globally communicate how important it is for older adults to maintain physical activity at home. Among older adults, there are cultural, sociological, and economic differences that need to be considered when developing targeted messages that echo a target audience's existing views and practices, to produce more powerful persuasive effects. Behavioral segmentation can help better understand and target messages for high-risk subgroups [19] like older adults. In conclusion, we are concerned about the level of independence and mental health status of older adults after the end of quarantine if there is no appropriate campaign to promote physical activity at home for them.

132327,"Notre étude démontre une diminution de la perception de la qualité du sommeil chez près de la moitié des participants en période de confinement. L'analyse multivariée a identifié une association nette entre la détérioration du sommeil en confinement et les comportements du sommeil, et une exposition à la lumière tandis qu'on note seulement une tendance pour les conditions de confinement. Certains éléments identifiés en analyse monovariée : l'âge et le sexe, le pratique de sport et le lieu de confinement, n'ont pas été retenus comme facteurs explicatifs par l'analyse multivariée. En revanche, il existe une forte association entre la diminution du temps du sommeil estimé par les patients et le sentiment d'une détérioration de la qualité du sommeil pendant le confinement, alors qu'une augmentation de la durée du sommeil est au contraire un facteur protecteur. L'appréciation du sommeil est subjective, et l'estimation de la durée du sommeil par un patient sous-estime souvent la durée réelle du sommeil [16] , surtout chez les insomniaques [17] . Or la plainte de diminution de la durée du sommeil chez nos participants ayant une détérioration de la qualité du sommeil est accompagnée d'une modification des Nous avons démontré une association importante entre l'exposition à la lumière, les comportements du sommeil et la qualité du sommeil. L'horloge biologique dépend d'un signal lumineux fort le matin pour la mise à jour de l'horloge centrale. Une exposition à la lumière intense le soir a deux effets sur le sommeil : tout d'abord un effet stimulant direct sur les systèmes d'éveil ce qui permet aux utilisateurs de rester plus vigilants et de se coucher plus tard [23] . Par ailleurs, une exposition à la lumière le soir décale l'horloge biologique par le blocage de la sécrétion de mélatonine, rendant l'éveil du matin plus tardif [24] [25] [26] . Une exposition limitée à la lumière de jour a été retrouvée chez 50 % de nos participants, couplée à une utilisation majorée des écrans le soir : 52% de nos participants (vs 23 % avant le confinement) ont utilisé leurs écrans pendant plus de trois heures le soir. Nous avons montré un lien direct entre une utilisation intense des écrans le soir (plus de trois heures) et un coucher plus tardif, et cette utilisation intense est aussi identifiée par l'analyse multivariée comme facteur associé à une détérioration du sommeil. Notre étude confirme qu'une détérioration de la qualité du sommeil est associée à une exposition peu importante à la lumière de jour, même en contrôlant l'exposition à la lumière le soir. L'intensité de la lumière du jour est importante : une exposition intense à la lumière du jour peut partiellement pallier une exposition intense à la lumière artificielle le soir [5, 6] . D'autres synchronisateurs peuvent remplacer la lumière, notamment ceux liés aux activités professionnelles ou sociales [27] . Or ces rythmes sont affaiblis en confinement, ce qui ne peut qu'aggraver les effets d'un environnement lumineux inadapté et provoquer l'apparition de décalages très marqués : 41% de notre population se couchait plus tard pendant le confinement, dont 6 % après 04h00. Le confinement est une période stressante, surtout pour les couples confinés avec leurs enfants, qui vent souvent cumuler travail, garde de leurs enfants, voire école à la maison. Le stress stimule les systèmes d'éveil et rend l'endormissement plus difficile : il est souvent un facteur déclenchant des insomnies ; ce lien entre stress, anxiété et insomnie a aussi été retrouvé dans d'autres études de confinement [9, 11, 12] . Un sommeil court et un éveil plus matinal sont des symptômes de stress ou de dépression [28] , et l'apparition des troubles dépressifs a été souligné dans les études de confinement [14] . Or nous n'avons pas évalué la dimension du stress, de l'anxiété ou de l'angoisse, qui aurait pu permettre d'anticiper un risque de décompensation psychiatrique. L'irrégularité des horaires notamment un jet-lag social important est connu dans les troubles de l'humeur, notamment chez les patients bipolaires [29] . Une durée du sommeil courte [30] , l'insomnie, les troubles circadiens et les troubles psychiatriques sont fortement liés, et les interventions qui améliorent les troubles du sommeil améliorent souvent les troubles psychiatriques [31, 32] . A contrario, on peut s'interroger sur la persistance ou non de ces troubles du sommeil après la période de confinement, sachant que les personnes chez lesquelles ils persisteront seront plus à risque suicidaire [33] . Une détérioration de la qualité du sommeil en confinement est un constat important, surtout pour les personnes qui dorment moins : le sommeil joue un rôle important dans les défenses immunitaires. Une revue récente conclut que non seulement le risque d'infection mais aussi la sévérité de l'infection par le SARS CoV-2 est influencée par la qualité du sommeil [34] , d'où l'importance de maintenir un sommeil de qualité en confinement. Les limitations de notre étude sont liées à notre méthodologie. Il n'est pas possible de déterminer le taux de réponse au moyen de questionnaires diffusés au travers des réseaux sociaux, sauf à disposer de dispositifs de traçages qui ne sont pas à la disposition du public, mais les études concordent sur un taux de réponse plus faible pour les enquêtes en ligne [35] . Nos profils d'âge et de sexe ne correspondent pas à ceux de la population française : les femmes et les personnes d'âge moyen sont sur-représentées et nos résultats ne sont pas généralisables au niveau national. Les difficultés démographiques associées aux questionnaires en ligne sont bien connues [36] . Une participation aux enquêtes en ligne diminue à partir de 50 ans [37] et une sur-représentation des femmes est souvent retrouvée, bien que les résultats soient hétérogènes concernant les études dans le domaine de la santé [38, 39] . En outre, notre étude est subjective et aucune évaluation objective du temps du sommeil n'a été faite. Enfin, nous nous sommes centrés sur les comportements du sommeil pour disposer d'un questionnaire court, facile à remplir afin d'optimiser le nombre de réponses et de ce fait d'autres facteurs explicatifs, notamment psychologiques sont manquants. Néanmoins nos résultats, qui mettent en exergue les effets néfastes de l'irrégularité des horaires, de l'insuffisance de sommeil, et d'une exposition à la lumière inadaptée, sont en accord avec les conseils des experts publiés en 2020 pour optimiser le sommeil en période de confinement qui proposent des horaires fixes, un temps passé au lit adapté aux besoins du sommeil et une exposition optimisée à la lumière [40] .

Our analysis allowed us to identify/predict the turning point, to predict the further spread, the duration and the final size (the attack rate) of the outbreak of COVID-19 in those six countries we studied. We found that among those six countries, France would ). If the current government actions remain unchanged, the outbreaks would likely to end at the beginning of June (ranging from May 21 to June 10) and the average duration of the outbreaks is 127 days (ranging from 115 to 138 days). It is seen from Tables 1 and 2 that the estimated parameter γ 1 's are all negative (except for Italy's, which is close to zero), and all γ 2 's are positive. This implies that if there were no major enforcement actions on control strategies such as lockdowns, social distancing, stayhome-advises/orders, then the COVID-19 would have spread exponentially. For example, the total confirmed cases in the USA would have passed 1, 000, 000 on April 05, 2020. This indicates that the interentions/actions greatly reduced the outbreak sizes and flatted the epidemic curves. Our prediction is based on the assumption that the current government interventions/actions would be imposed until the estimated end dates of the outbreaks. If those interventions were lifted or removed earlier cautiously based on scientific evidences, we would not expect any dramatic differences. On the other hand, if those interventions were lifted or removed earlier hastily without scientific support, our prediction would provide a reference to assess consequences of such irresponsible decisions.

132449,"Demographic COVID related information: to collect data on gender, age, education, occupation, and region of origin, a questionnaire including demographic information was administered. A section aimed to evaluate contact on COVID-19 infection was included. Generalized Anxiety Symptoms: the General Anxiety Disorder questionnaire (GAD-7) [10] was administered. The GAD includes 7 items on a 4-point Likert scale ranging from 0 (never) to 3 (nearly every day). The total score ranges from 0 to 21, with higher scores indicating more severe functional impairments as a result of anxiety. For this study, we defined a GAD-7 total score of 10 points or higher as an index of the presence of generalized anxiety symptoms [11] . Psychological Well-Being: to measure general psychological well-being or distress, the Psychological General Well-Being questionnaire (PGWB) was adopted [12] . The PGWB consists of 22 items, divided into six dimensions: Anxiety, Depressed mood, Positive wellbeing, Self-control, General health, and Vitality. Responses are given on a 6-point Likert scale ranging from 0 to 5. The total score ranges from 0 to 110. A global score and measures for each dimension are calculated, with higher scores indicating greater well-being. In our study, PGWB scores lower than 60 indicated a higher level of distress according to Chassany et al., [13] Sleep Quality: sleep characteristics have been assessed through the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) [14] , an 18-item questionnaire used to measure sleep quality. The PSQI includes items evaluating sleep quality, sleep duration, sleep latency, habitual sleep efficiency, sleep disorders, the use of sleeping medications, and daytime dysfunctions. Each dimension scored between 0-3, with a total score ranging from 0-21. Higher scores indicate lower sleep quality. A global PSQI score higher than 5 points indicates poor sleep quality [14] . Moreover, to analyze variables not considered by the PSQI, we included in the survey some items focused on assessing sleep fragmentation (interruptions of sleep during the night), nap duration, the percentage of sleep efficiency and the total sleep time in minutes. COVID-19 as a risk factor for PTSD occurrence: PTSD related to COVID-19 (COVID-19-PTSD; a modified version of PTSD Checklist for DSM-5; PCL-5) [15] is a selfreported questionnaire designed ad hoc to assess specific symptoms concerning the COVID-19 emergency, similar to PTSD symptoms, according to DSM-5 criteria. The questionnaire includes 19 items structured on a 5-point Likert scale (from 0= not at all to 4= extremely). The psychometric qualities of this questionnaire indicate a monofactorial structure, explaining 49% of the variance and a Cronbach's α equal to 0.94 [16] . The rapid human-to-human transmission of COVID-19 has greatly influenced national and international policies. To the best of our knowledge, our study is the first to report the psychological effects of the COVID-19 emergency in Italy, approximately two months after the Sars-COVID-2 outbreak and one month after mandatory strict isolation and social distancing dispositions of the Italian Government. These severe measures were taken to avoid further spread of the COVID-19 epidemic, including the request to isolation at home for both people infected by the virus and people without infection, prohibiting all gathering activities, and mandating the wearing of surgical masks in public places. As this is the first instance in Italy that such contention measures were adopted, this study aimed to document the well-being of the Italian population forced to quarantine through the context of sleep quality, generalized anxiety symptoms, and psychological distress. The results revealed that 57.1% of the respondents experienced poor sleep quality, 32.1% had high levels of generalized anxiety symptoms, 41.8% experienced psychological distress, and 7.6% reported relevant PTSD symptomatology linked to the COVID-19 diffusion. Studies on the Italian population underlined a 30% prevalence of sleep problems [17] , with 10.3% anxiety disorders [18] , and 29.3% experiencing psychological distress [19] . However, the use of various questionnaires to assess these psychological dimensions and the different samples in the studies made a statistical comparison impossible. However, it is possible to observe that our results showed a substantially worse psychological condition during the actual emergency. Finally, it is impossible to differentiate whether the results are attributable to the fear of the epidemic or the restrictive measures imposed by the Italian government. Characteristics of the sample (eg, younger age, being female, having uncertainty about the possibility of contracting the infection by COVID-19, or having had direct contacts with people infected by COVID-19) appear to relate with wore psychological conditions. Individuals with these characteristics are more likely to develop sleep problems, anxiety symptomatology, and psychological distress, similar to what has been reported in previous studies on the COVID-19 or the SARS outbreak [20, 21] . The results of the present study have shown that two out of three Italians had disturbed sleep during the COVID-19 outbreak, although the comparison with previous data from the general population underlined significant differences only in sleep latency and daytime dysfunctions. However, significant differences were reported in sleep quality considering Italian territorial areas with a worse status in North Italy, according to the most widespread and the highest number of deaths due to COVID-19 in this Italian territorial area. Extensive research has documented the importance of sleep in restoring neurobehavioral functions and many psychological aspects, including emotion regulation, depression, and anxiety [22] . Moreover, other psychological conditions, such as PTSD and other stress-related disorders, are significantly associated with an impairment of sleep quality [7, 22] . Reduced sleep quality negatively affects life satisfaction, health status, social, and emotional domains [23, 24] . Additionally, studies have reported an association between poor sleep quality and high risk of falls, infections, or the cold virus as a consequence of a reduction of the immune response Considering other psychological variables, one out of three Italians showed higher generalized anxiety symptoms, and two out of five Italians perceived psychological distress and lower well-being during the COVID-19 pandemic. As reported by studies on natural disasters, war crisis, and other epidemic emergencies [26, 28] , these situations are associated with high levels of anxiety and distress, which represent some of the precursors of the PTSD onset. In our sample, these results have been confirmed. Sleep quality, generalized anxiety, and psychological distress were associated with PTSD symptomatology. Our findings confirmed the results of previous studies on the priority role of disturbed sleep in contributing to the development of PTSD symptoms [29] . Moreover, we confirmed the results of preceding studies on the Chinese population who reported high concomitance of sleep disturbance, psychological distress, and anxiety in the general population during the COVID-19 outbreak, with an increased risk of PTSD occurrence [20, 30] . Although further longitudinal studies are necessary, the present findings make us worry about the possible development of PTSD in the Italian population consequent to the COVID-19 emergency. To better understand the current Italian status, one aim of this study was to compare our data with previous ones reported by researches on the general population and collected under usual conditions [11, 13, 14] . Our results, as expected, indicated poor sleep quality, higher levels of generalized anxiety, and higher psychological distress in the Italian population involved in the COVID-19 emergency. Although these results should be considered with caution, given some characteristics of the samples considered, they further confirm the stressful impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the well-being of the Italian population. The uncertainty of the epidemic progression, together with the restrictive measures adopted by the Italian Government, is causing higher psychological pressure due to the fear that the epidemic is hard to control. In the first few weeks alone, the COVID-19 pandemic has already had dangerous effects on the Italian population. Our findings suggest that symptoms highlighted above can be a potent risk factor for the development of psychological diseases as previously reported for the Chinese population and accordingly with other studies on epidemic and quarantine conditions [3, [31] [32] [33] . Considering the perception and the effects of the COVID-19 epidemic in the different territorial areas, people who reside in North Italy, considered the principal Italian core of the emergency, characterized by the highest number of infections and deaths [2] , compared to Centre and South Italy, reported the worst sleep quality and psychological symptomatology. These results are consistent with a study about the psychological impact of the SARS, which demonstrated that residents in the region with the high prevalence of SARS cases have shown higher psychological consequences and were prone to develop PTSD symptomology [34] . People living in high infection-prevalent locations perceive themselves to be at higher risk of infection, as confirmed by the low general health perception reported in the PGWB. Conversely, the lockdown of the transport hub and the overload of the public health system in most cities of North Italy could have led to a detrimental psychological impact on residents impacting on sleep quality and psychological symptomatology. Yet, this relationship has not been clarified. Some studies suggested that people who were repeatedly exposed to traumatic events were prone to suffering from many psychological problems [35] . Other researchers found no relationship between the prolonged exposure to critical events and the gravity of psychological symptoms [36] considering exposure to epidemics [37] . As stated previously, further studies are needed to explore the psychological distress associated with the exposure history of epidemics, considering the restrictive measures adopted to contain the contagion. Although the findings of the current study appear relevant in the current COVID-19 emergency, some limitations need to be considered. First, the data and results were derived from a cross-sectional design, making causal inferences challenging. In addition, the adoption of the online survey limits the generalizability of the results, although it currently represents the best solution for data collection in times of social distancing. Accordingly, a recruitment bias emerged in our sample, which is characterized by a high number of young adults, mainly students, and women. This aspect should be considered in the interpretation of the results. Especially those variables that were compared with previous data collected on the general population, because these characteristics could be associated with an increased risk of psychopathological conditions. The risk factors analyses have also suggested it. Moreover, some aspects (eg, younger age or being female) could have affected the individual responses to the actual emergency. Considering the statistical comparisons with the general population data, the absence of percentage data on the considered dimensions in the general population did not allow us to compare our percentages in the investigated diseases with the prevalence of sleep disturbance, generalized anxiety, and psychological distress in the general population. Previous studies have shown that the epidemic diffusion of viral diseases (eg, SARS, Ebola) can be related to anxiety, depression, distress, sleep disorders, and post-traumatic stress disorders, not only for the medical impact of the infection but also for the impact of quarantine measures aimed to reduce the outbreak [3] . Accordingly, studies conducted in China on the effect of the COVID-19 diffusion on psychological dimensions and well-being highlighted similar results [8, 9] . This study, for the first time, confirmed similar results considering the Italian population, and investigates some aspects of the role of extreme situations on the variables under investigation. Generally, there is still a lack of relevant research on the targeted intervention on psychological aspects during the COVID-19 epidemic. However, it should be essential to increase the number of these studies, not only in the Italian population but also in the other countries in which the COVID-19 emergency is spreading. These results appear relevant to predispose effective psychological interventions focused on the improvement of the psychological well-being and in the reduction of risk of occurrence of stress-related disorders. Interventions of this kind are recommended, especially considering vulnerable populations. Table 5 .

133305,"The power-law growth of the cumulative number of confirmed infected individuals by the COVID-19 until March 27, 2020, is shown to be the best descriptive scenario for the countries Brazil, China, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Spain, Republic of Korea, and USA. Distinct power-law exponents for the countries are found and summarized in Table I . The power-law behavior suggests that the underlying propagation dynamics of the virus around these countries follows scale free networks, fractal kinetics, and small world features. 5, 6, 9 While power-laws with distinct exponents may look visually similar, it is necessary to quantify this similarity. For this, we compute the Distance Correlation 10-12 between all countries mentioned above (not shown). However, we use results for the DC from representative countries from four continents, namely, Brazil, Italy, Japan, and USA (see Fig. 2 ). They show that the power-law growth between these countries are highly correlated, even between North and South Hemispheres. The high correlation between the powerlaw curves of different continents strongly suggest that government strategies can be applied with success around the whole world. Furthermore, we propose a variation in the well known SEIR epidemic model 19, 20 for predictions using (or not) distinct government strategies applied on March 28, 2020. We apply numerically distinct strategies to flatten (or not) the power-law curves. Even though the social isolation, a well known benefit, is very powerful to flatten the curves, we found other strategies which lead to comparable results. For Italy and France, for example, the best scenario was obtained when reducing the social interaction to θ = 0.8 (light blue curves). However, if 5% of the asymptomatic and mild symptomatic individuals are identified and isolated everyday (κ a = 0.05), asymptotic values of the same order of magnitude for the symptomatic cases were obtained even if θ = 1.0 (magentadashed curve). On the other hand, for Brazil and USA, our simulations confirm that to keep the social distance is essential to decrease the asymptotic number of infected individuals, and even better results could be obtained by increasing the tests to identify and isolate asymptomatic and mild symptomatic individuals (compare light blue and orange curves). The above combination between social interaction and the huge degree of isolation of infected individuals could be implemented to prevent economic catastrophes because people are not working. In other words, let some essential individuals go back to work (increasing θ ) and, simultaneously, increase by a huge amount the number of daily tests and isolation of infected individuals. This could furnish an efficient scenario to flatten the power-law. Nevertheless, we point out again that our main results confirm that the social isolation of individuals is by far the best efficient strategy to flatten the curves.

133340,"Public health measures were decisive in controlling the SARS epidemic in 2003. Isolation is the separation of ill persons from non-infected persons. Quarantine is movement restriction, often with fever surveillance, of contacts when it is not evident whether they have been infected but are not yet symptomatic or have not been infected. Community containment includes measures that range from increasing social distancing to community-wide quarantine. Whether these measures will be sufficient to control 2019-nCoV depends on addressing some unanswered questions.","Public health measures were decisive in controlling the SARS epidemic in 2003.<q>Isolation is the separation of ill persons from non-infected persons.<q>Whether these measures will be sufficient to control 2019-nCoV depends on addressing some unanswered questions.

133542,"Adopting precautionary regulations such as social isolation, increasing sanitation, and employing strict quarantine measures have proved to be beneficial in containing the virus. Further research needs to be conducted to help discover therapeutic modalities and improve outcomes. As described in the Results section, there have been a total of 156,622 confirmed cases of COVID-19 spread across 154 countries worldwide. These cases occurred over the course of 53 days and spanned over six continents through person-to-person transmission, highlighting an extremely high infectivity rate [11] . The 5,845 deaths caused by COVID-19 as of March 14, 2020, equate to around 3.7% of all infected cases. This is relatively better than the rates of previous SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, which reached 10% and 35%, respectively [8] . This is also complemented by a high recovery rate, where more than 75,000 patients fully recovered from the disease. Nevertheless, precautionary measures remain an obligation, and prevention protocols need to be set, regardless of the relatively favorable prognosis of this disease, when compared with its predecessors. The initial 22 days of reporting showed a significant increase in the overall disease cases worldwide. This was explained by the continuous and chain-like human-to-human transmission at the birth site of the disease in China, along with poor restrictions on travel and transit [12] . This led to a rapid and prevalent spread that reached many nearby regions and countries. However, a significant decrease in incidence followed during the next 11 days, mainly due to decisions taken by the Chinese government and the Chinese CDC [13] . These decisions ranged from raising awareness, disinfection, and declaring states of emergency, to building make-shift hospitals for patient management [3, 14] . This helped contain the disease in China and led to an eventual decrease in incidence. Nevertheless, a subsequent significant increase in worldwide incidence ensued as of day 33 onward due to the rapid spread of the disease across the Chinese borders. Many countries did not possess the required resources and facilities to face such a pandemic and were, thus, vulnerable to its high infectivity. The main countries affected outside of China are Italy in Europe and Iran in Asia, where cases continue to increase at an alarming rate. What is even more concerning is that the percentage of deaths from resolved cases in the latter countries is prominently high. In Italy, the death rate fluctuated at the beginning, increasing and then decreasing, before witnessing a steady rise that has been going on up until day 53. It is evident that the Italian healthcare system was taken by surprise with respect to the viral outbreak, and this lack of preparation explains the initial increase in death rates [15] . The subsequent decrease can be explained by the initial attempts at containment proposed by the Italian government; however, oversaturation of the hospitals and facilities caused a subsequent rise in the death rate that has been going on steadily [16] . On the other hand, Iran had a mortality rate of 100% during the first couple of days of reporting. This can be warranted as under-reporting from the Iranian government due to lack of screening resources possessed at the time as well as the vulnerable healthcare system present, which could not properly contain or adequately treat the disease in the affected populations [17] . Subsequent continuous decrease in mortality rates coupled with increases in recovery rates followed up until the most recent reports. COVID-19 has become a worldwide pandemic affecting all inhabited continents of Earth. Although Asia was the epicenter of the disease during the start of the COVID-19 pandemic with the major outbreaks in China, Iran, South Korea, and Japan, other continents must not be forgotten. With the containment that occurred in China and the decreasing death rates in Iran, attention has shifted to European countries exhibiting increasing incidence such as Germany, France, and Switzerland. The significance of fighting COVID-19 more aggressively in Europe revolves around the old-age structure found in its countries, which means that there are more vulnerable people affected [18] . Africa, on the other hand, suffers from abysmal medical infrastructure and would require international aid to help stop preventable deaths caused by the disease [19] . Parallels can be drawn to South America, which only further proves that this pandemic will not end except with a collective global effort. We must adhere to infectious control guidelines in order to help contain the disease and decrease the number of people being hospitalized. People exposed to the virus and showing symptoms must undergo polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test and, if positive, be isolated and treated. If the test turns out negative, it is advised to remain in home quarantine for 14 days. People who are exposed to the virus but do not show any symptoms must remain in home quarantine for 14 days. People who exhibit symptoms but have not been exposed to the disease must check with a medical doctor, implement safety precautions (proper coughing and sneezing etiquette), and avoid going out unless necessary. Finally, those who show no symptoms and have not been exposed to the disease are recommended to practice continuous hand hygiene and adhere to precautionary measures (washing hands with soap for at least 20 seconds, use of antiseptics, avoid touching the face, etc.). Avoiding unnecessary social interactions is also essential for the prevention of exposure. The lessons that can be learnt from the Chinese model are that good isolation, quarantine, and sanitization are the best measures against this global disease. Although this virus has affected many countries and populations, there is still a lot to be known regarding its pathogenicity and viral characteristics. More research and studies must be conducted to help fight off this virus, discover possible vaccines or cures, and establish safety plans for future epidemics or pandemics [20] [21] [22] . COVID-19 has impacted the world in a way that could not have been predicted. Its rapid expansion over six continents, and in such a short period of time, delineates its high infective potential. The high mortality rates observed in some nations served to show how unprepared our healthcare systems were when facing such a global pandemic. Nevertheless, the healthcare plans adopted by China have proved that social distancing, increasing sanitation, and employing full quarantine can be very beneficial for containing this pandemic. As the worldwide incidence rate increases, governments are urged to take strict measures and enforce stringent precautions to help contain the disease, limit its spread, and decrease its subsequent mortality rate.

In the first section, we focused on the outbreak that occurred aboard the Diamond Princess and described the history of ongoing infections by reviewing publicly accessible newspaper reports and government public relations. In addition, we presented issues that must be scrutinized from the perspectives of public health (in the Facts to Be Examined section) and public health ethics. Finally, in terms of public health preparedness in the future, we highlighted the need for international collaboration and global justice. Because information on the biological nature and epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19 is complex, ethical requirements include optimizing isolation conditions, giving consideration to the QOL to those who are isolated, and ensuring the transparency of information disclosure. Considering that a cruise ship is a miniature international society, international coordination and global justice are needed to reduce social and economic disparities.

133814,"Media reports play increasingly important roles in the outbreak of the COVID-19 epidemic, which can be used to provide the public with information about the dynamic situation of the epidemic and the effective prevention and control measures proposed by experts. It follows from the Pearson correlation and the cross-correlation analyses that the number of daily news items at the ten most popular websites (news.cn, sina.com, cnr.cn, youth.cn, Chinanews.com, gov.com, 163.com, people.com, sohu.com, globalhealth.net.cn) complexity, and we will address the effects of these important factors on the emerging infectious disease in near future. Secondly, we have assumed the exposed individuals do not to infect others in our model(??). However, if the exposed (latent) individuals are assumed to infect others, even if infectivity is very low, it will certainly affect the severity of the epidemic. This study presents a novel methodology through using cross-correlation analysis and embedding the function of individual behavior changes (media impact) into the SEIR-type model, showed that combining statistical analysis with a mathematical model are beneficial for analyzing media impacts. It demonstrated that the media reports and these control measures affect the accumulated number of hospital no-tifications by reducing the transmission rate (increasing the individual behaviour change constant), the contact rate and quarantined duration of uninfected contacts individuals, and also increasing the quarantined rate of exposed individuals. All these results confirmed the importance of the responses of individuals to the media reports, and the crucial role of experts and governments in promoting the public under self-quarantine. Therefore, for mitigating COVID-19 epidemic, the media publicity should be focused on how to guide people's behavioral changes by experts, and the management departments and designated hospitals of the COVID-19 should take effective quarantined measures, which are critical for the control of the disease.

134091,"The focus of our analysis was not towards predicting the burden of COVID-19 cases but to identify rational intervention strategies that might work towards control of the outbreak in India. We modelled the potential impact of containment strategy of point-of-entry screening and a mitigation response through symptomatic screening on hypothetical COVID-19 transmission scenario in India. Our results suggest that in order to have an appreciable effect on delaying the establishment of transmission of COVID-19 in India, airport arrival screening will need to have near-complete capture of incoming COVID-19 cases, including asymptomatic cases. Although not practically feasible using the currently available tools, our results provide a hypothetical illustration of the additional benefit of identifying asymptomatic cases: if they escape any containment effort, they would tend to negate the effects of that effort, by the onward transmission that they can cause. Presently, there is no accurate, rapid test for COVID-19 that could be deployed in this setting, to reach the required levels of detection among asymptomatic cases; the only way to reach 90 per cent diagnosis among asymptomatic arrivals may be through isolation and quarantine of all arrivals from specified origin airports. Resources may be better spent on the mitigation of infection in the community. Recent studies indicate that airport screening may not be able to sufficiently detect COVID-19-infected travellers. Quilty et al 19 estimated that 46 per cent (95% confidence interval: 36 to 58) of infected travellers would not be detected by thermal screening at airport exit and entry, depending on incubation period, sensitivity of exit and entry screening and proportion of asymptomatic cases. Gostic et al 20 estimated that travel screening would miss more than half of the infected travellers on account of being asymptomatic and being unaware of exposure, emphasizing the need for post-travel symptom tracking among them. Our study adds to this by considering the population implications of such leakages in arrival screening. Our analysis shows that, even if symptomatic cases are comprehensively identified and quarantined, the delay in epidemic timing within India would be in days and not weeks. According to the data shared by the Delhi Health Department 21 , till February 13, 2020, 17 of 5700 (0.3%) passengers, who had arrived from China and other COVID-19-affected countries prior to the beginning of airport screening from January 15, 2020, were found symptomatic and hospitalized, while the rest were advised for home isolation. The status of another 885 passengers remains unknown 21 . Entry screening or travel restrictions may be beneficial in reducing the risk of outbreak in countries with relatively low connectivity to China, and our study illustrates the critical importance of community-based measures to detect potential cases and prevent transmission. We also examined the potential impact of quarantine of symptomatics, in controlling transmission within India, with a focus on four major metropolitan areas. Our results suggest that it may be possible to interrupt the transmission of COVID-19 in India, but only in the most optimistic scenarios (for R 0 and for coverage). Even with high R 0 and suboptimal coverage, symptomatic quarantine can still achieve meaningful reductions in peak prevalence, resulting in 'spreading out' of the outbreak. This would make it easier to cope Fig. 5 . Projected duration of epidemic (days) for the scenarios with and without symptomatic quarantine at 50 per cent coverage in three days by R 0 and relative infectiousness of asymptomatic cases. Here, the 'epidemic duration' is measured as the duration (in days) over which the prevalence of symptomatic infection is >1 case. with the peak demand on health services. However, such measures would have very little effect on the overall epidemic size. The actual numerical impact will be highly sensitive to the natural history of COVID-19, the parameters for which are very uncertain at present. The WHO Scientific and Technical Advisory Group for Infectious Hazards has recommended continuation of the containment strategy and monitoring for the community transmission of COVID-19 22 . It recommends close monitoring of the effectiveness and social acceptance of public health strategies to control COVID-19 transmission in the light of its evolving epidemiological understanding, including engagement of vulnerable populations, and intensified active surveillance 22 . Continuous follow up of passengers returning from COVID-19-affected countries and their contact tracing for the emergence of suggestive symptoms would put a high strain on the healthcare system, more so in the eventuality of the introduction of community transmission. The increasing numbers would make it impractical to use laboratory testing to confirm each case, and therefore, use of symptomatic surveillance should become the primary public health strategy to detect and respond in the most effective and timely manner. We could draw examples from the syndromic surveillance approach for influenza-like illness in the context of H1N1 23 . In practice, this could be achieved either through public advisories for sick individuals to self-quarantine, along with active engagement with the community, or through intensive surveillance for symptoms, followed by testing and quarantine. A combination of both approaches is likely to be needed, although promoting self-quarantine is likely to be more sustainable in the event that transmission becomes widespread. Engagement of local volunteers and community-based organizations can provide the much-needed boost to the efforts of the public health system. Considering the widespread use of mobile phones in the country, mobile applications can be used to self-monitoring and sharing of symptom information on a real-time basis. The same was done for monitoring the passengers on the cruise ship off the Japanese coast 24 . With the evolving understanding of COVID-19 epidemiology, especially the proportion of asymptomatic infected cases, it is difficult to predict the number of beds required or ventilators necessary for COVID-19 cases at this stage. As per reports from other affected countries, we may expect eight to ten severe and 40-50 non-severe COVID-19 cases for every death 25, 26 . In a closed setting of similar nature as that on the cruise ship 'Diamond Princess,' we may expect 26 per cent of the entire population to get infected and one in 450 infected individuals to die 27 . We deduce that around five per cent of the infected patients will require intensive care and half of those admitted in the intensive care unit will require mechanical ventilation. Over time, once the model is validated, appropriate numbers can be generated for healthcare planning. It is pertinent that frontline healthcare workers are identified and trained before the outbreak sets in. Health and life insurance should be announced for healthcare workers if they contract COVID-19. Considering the reports of a high number of infected healthcare workers, measures should be taken to build biosecurity wards and prepare for the outbreak in earnest. Resources should be earmarked; adequate supplies should be procured before the outbreak gains momentum. Healthcare workers should be trained in the use of personal protective equipment, screening of asymptomatic contacts, isolation measures and management of COVID-19 cases. Public health measures should be initiated at multiple levels, including but not limited to public messaging, and community health worker-based education. Limitations of the model: As with any modelling study, our analysis has some limitations to note. The mean duration of asymptomatic and symptomatic stages is very much uncertain. Some infections may be subclinical and never develop symptoms. In the port-of-entry screening model, we adopted simple assumptions on the number of daily arrivals from non-coronavirus-affected areas due to lack of data. However, considering that we have only used data for airport arrivals and in particular from China, these assumptions are likely to be underestimates in the current situation where people are travelling from many other countries that are now reporting COVID-19 cases, and are thus conservative with respect to our conclusions; higher numbers of daily arrivals would tend to narrow the gap in epidemic timing, between baseline and interventional scenarios. Other important uncertainties include natural history parameters, for example, the average duration of infection; the incubation period and the case fatality rate. Though we have tried to address some of these uncertainties through examining different scenarios for transmission, yet we caution that our model findings may also be sensitive to these other parameters. As more data become available about this new virus, subsequent modelling work can be refined accordingly. For the country-level model, for simplicity, we created hypothetical scenarios only in four metropolitan areas that have the highest population density. These areas cover only about seven per cent of the total population of India. We ignored the rural population surrounded by these areas and their connectivity. Future work to address this gap will benefit from more systematic information on the rates of population flow between these different settings, data that were not available for our current study. We have simplified our meta-population model by considering constant connectivity between different cities, ignoring age-dependent mobility among the population. How seasonality will change the endemicity of COVID-19 is still unknown and hence not considered in the model. Although there appear to be differences in the immune responses of children compared to adults, for simplicity, this model has not accounted the disease prevalence with age structure. Comparison of our projected figures with data from countries such as Japan, the Republic of Korea and Iran can help to validate our model, assuming similar transmission dynamics in India. It may be noted that our analysis is based on the available global epidemiological parameters from the initial phase of the outbreak. However, we believe that the predicted direction of the model-based impact of the proposed interventions would remain unaffected, although the onset, magnitude and timing of the simulated epidemic may change, even with the use of updated parameter values from the evolving global situation of COVID-19 epidemic. Validation of mathematical models using real-time data is important to gauge the accuracy of predicted transmission dynamics of infectious diseases. While some models for Ebola virus disease 27 provided fairly reasonable estimates, recent COVID-19 models 28 were inconsistent in their prediction. Public health implications: At present, it is not clear to what extent the COVID-19 epidemic would establish itself in India. As the introduction of cases may take anywhere from a minimum of 20 days to a few months to be visible, we need to enhance surveillance and prepare the community in a proportionate way that is neither alarmist nor complacent. The critical concerns are the efficiency and timeliness of quarantine and isolation and the challenges of detection of COVID-19 with symptoms similar to many other lower respiratory tract infections. There is a need to engage community-based organizations that can take up the work of symptomatic surveillance, as well as raising awareness of the need for self-quarantine where possible, and referral to hospital where necessary, till infection is confirmed. Till that time, assurance of food and supplies should be given following examples of such practices in Kerala 29 . It is pertinent to engage with the media on a proactive basis with the provision of facts promptly such that reporting of these events does not create a picture of the overwhelming burden of COVID-19 in the country and lead to undue anxiety among the population that may negatively influence self-quarantine. Health authorities need to be on alert and be prepared to closely monitor the situation with the establishment of an intensified surveillance. We advocate for a rational, flexible and resilient approach that is sensitive to the outbreak stage as the health system prepares for the control of COVID-19 transmission in India. ","Our results suggest that in order to have an appreciable effect on delaying the establishment of transmission of COVID-19 in India, airport arrival screening will need to have near-complete capture of incoming COVID-19 cases, including asymptomatic cases.<q>Presently, there is no accurate, rapid test for COVID-19 that could be deployed in this setting, to reach the required levels of detection among asymptomatic cases; the only way to reach 90 per cent diagnosis among asymptomatic arrivals may be through isolation and quarantine of all arrivals from specified origin airports.<q>The focus of our analysis was not towards predicting the burden of COVID-19 cases but to identify rational intervention strategies that might work towards control of the outbreak in India.

134112,"The SARS-CoV-2 outbreak started in Wuhan City, China, in December 2019. It is now a global pandemic, with 1,773,084 confirmed cases, 111,652 deaths, and 467,074 recoveries (as of 13 April 2020). The virus has the potential for rapid and extensive spread between people and countries. There are a lot of misleading information and knowledge gaps on the newly emerged SARS-CoV-2. Therefore, we reviewed the latest updates about different aspects including epidemiology, source of infection, transmission dynamics, zoonotic potential, virus characteristics, and discovery of novel strategies for disease control to avoid spillover of infection in the future. Bats play an important role in the transmission of the infection to humans. Coronaviruses are genetically diverse and have a high tendency towards frequent genetic mutations and gene recombination, which increases the risk of interspecies transmission. Information about the incubation period can help in establishing an effective quarantine for asymptomatic carriers, thus preventing the virus spread. From our perspectives and based on the currently available information about the virus and its epidemiology, the control of the SARS-CoV-2 requires an effective and global disease coordination effort including multidisciplinary research efforts (One-Health approach) through collaboration between governments, epidemiologists, virologists, health authorities, veterinarians, and physicians. At this stage of the disease outbreak, developing vaccines is crucial to limit the spread of the infection.

135197,"In this paper, the parameters of the system are mainly chosen by two means including the references and the PSO algorithm. Usually, the parameters can be set according to the existing work. For instance, the contact and infection rate parameters are defined according to Refs. [26, 29] . Also, there are some other references which show some parameters of the system. Moreover, since there is actual COVID-19 data from Hubei province, we use the PSO algorithm to estimate the parameters of the system. As shown above, the system has rich dynamics with the given parameters, especially when the parameters b 1 , b 2 and v have seasonality and stochastic infection. The existence of chaos is verified by the 0-1 test, and complexity of the generated time series is measured. Here, different sets of parameters are summarized in Table 6 . It should noted that, when the parameters are set as the set A, they seem ''large.'' However, those parameters should be multiplied by S/N. Thus, they are reasonable for the proposed model. According to our analysis, it shows that chaos are found in the system with those ''large parameters.'' In fact, we want to explore the nonlinear dynamics of the proposed system and to study how does chaos occur in the system. Figure 12 shows the evolution of the system with different parameters. The parameters used the Set D, and different colors lines in the figure including magenta color lines (M), blue color lines (B), red color lines (R) and green color lines (G) are obtained using the following parameters: It shows that the number of infected class (I 1 , I 2 ) and hospitalized class (H) is different with different parameters. When u ¼ 0:0009, there is a peak value for I 2 . It means that if the hospital reception capacity is limited, the infected class (I 2 ) will increase dramatically. However, when u ¼ 0:8, the infected class (I 2 ) keeps a relative low level; thus, the infection can be controlled well. As shown in Fig. 12 , when a ¼ 0:5, it is quite difficulty for the system to become convergent. The reason is obvious because those recovered can be infected again, and a closed loop system is observed. Because no reports show that the recovered class is immune to the COVID-19, we need to be aware of those recovered to be infected again. Here, the evolution of the system with parameters of set E is shown in Fig. 13 , which shows how all the classes of the system affect the dynamics. Generally, all the classes except the recovered class R will converge to zero. However, Fig. 13 is simulated with external input K ¼ 100 and a ¼ 0:5. Since there is no evidence that the recovered class is immune to the virus, this makes the system hard to converge. Thus, it shows in Fig. 13 that these variables converge to zero slowly. In the early stage of the COVID-19 epidemic, the epidemic situation in Hubei province presents an uncontrollable trend. However, due to the low population contact rate, high hospitalization rate and high cure rate, the epidemic was quickly controlled after 20 days. Therefore, the government's attention, people's self-awareness and sufficient medical resources are the key to eliminate the threat of COVID-19. To get better estimation results, we need to built a proper model and also need to set proper parameters for the systems. To the knowledge of authors, the parameters of the system change as time since the control from the government is different along with time. Thus, we can also treat the parameters as functions of time. If the values of b 1 , b 2 and v are large, the system can even become chaotic. When q 2 takes larger values, it means that there are more people which have like COVID-19-symptoms. In fact, the government should take stronger and harsher measures to increase isolation, especially there are many potential infections. Meanwhile, if the quarantine is done well, the values of b 1 , b 2 and v will be also much smaller; thus, it is helpful to control the spread of the epidemic disease. In this paper, a SEIR model is proposed for the COVID-19. Parameters of the system are estimated by the PSO algorithm, and dynamics of the system is investigated. Finally, how the parameters affect the dynamics of the system is discussed and the control strategies are presented. The conclusions of this paper are given as follows. (1) The proposed model has considered the quarantine and treatment, so it is more suitable for the dynamics of the epidemic of COVID-19. (2) The PSO algorithm provides a good way for parameter estimation of the SEIR model. And according to the application to the data of Hubei province, the accuracy is acceptable. The main trends of the epidemic evolution are illustrated. (3) Nonlinear dynamics of the system is investigated by means of bifurcation diagram, MSE algorithm and 0-1 test algorithm. It shows that, for the given parameters, if there exists seasonality and stochastic infection, the system can generate chaos. (4) Some control suggestions are suggested based on the proposed model. Meanwhile, we found that the dynamics of the system is different with different sets of parameters.

135299,"By comparing cases from the Third Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yatsen University between January 22 to February 18, 2020 and Wuhan Jinyintan Hospital between January 1 to January 25, 2020, this study revealed the changes in pathogenicity and epidemic characteristics of COVID-19 in the epidemic process. Both hospitals are designated hospital for COVID-19. Although small in number, the Guangzhou patients were a random sample at an early stage when cases started being imported into a major city. The different admission time in the two hospitals could represent two stages of the epidemic, while treatment and follow-up time are the same, which may well reflect the changing clinical and epidemiological characteristics of the disease. The median ages of cases in Wuhan reported by Cao and Zhang were 49.0 and 55.5 years respectively 8, 22 , while patients in Guangzhou were relatively younger, with the median age of 43.2 years. There have been reports of cases in children, indicating all ages are susceptible [24] . Compared with patients in Guangzhou, patients in Wuhan were more severe, reflected by that Wuhan patients had a higher incidence of dyspnea and ARDS, higher levels of inflammatory biomarkers and worse prognosis. These differences could be due to age and pre-existing conditions [8, 25, 26] . However, in the present study, we did not observe an evident difference in underlying disease between Guangzhou patients and Wuhan patients. We speculate that the differences may be related to that the diminishing pathogenicity of the virus after transmission of multiple generations [5, 27] , however, further studies are required to confirm this hypothesis. Besides, patients in Guangzhou were more aware of the disease; thus, they visited the hospital at the earlier stage with less severe symptoms. Furthermore, given the experience in Wuhan, the health authorities in Guangzhou were wellprepared for the epidemic and were able to carry out comprehensive screening, early case identification and contact tracing and timely treatment. In terms of clinical characteristics, we observed that the gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhea and vomiting were more prevalent in patients with later-onset in Guangzhou. Meanwhile, fecal RNA was positive in 4 out of 7 patients, indicating the possibility of gastrointestinal transmission. Xiao Fei also confirmed gastrointestinal infection by detecting SARS-CoV-2 in feces and gastrointestinal tissues [28] . These findings have important implications for patient triage and hospital risk zoning. Gastroenterology outpatient medical staff could be at higher risk when encountering COVID patients, thus more aggressive PPE protection and proactive patient screening are necessary. In addition, sufficient education and protocols should be given to caregivers who could be exposed to the patients' vomits and feces directly, and feces disposal should be managed properly to reduce environmental harzards. More importantly, we found that two patients' fecal virus RNA turned negative 5 and 6 days later than the nasopharyngeal swab respectively, suggesting that transimission of virus is possibly prolonged, and fecal virus RNA may be an indispensable indicator for lifting quarantines. Given that some ""recovered"" cases being tested positive again a few days after discharged have been reported recently [29], our findings highlight the importance of fecal virus test for patient management and quarantines. The health authority may also have to re-consider quarantine strategy for possible extended case management time and burden when distributing health resources. Our findings also suggest that the modes of transmission have changed considerably with the spread of the disease. A large fraction of early reported cases in Wuhan were linked to Huanan seafood markets, whereas none of cases in Guangzhou had a history of exposure to wildlife markets. Furthermore, 10 patients from Guangzhou were involved in seven cases of clustering. This finding suggests strong community transmission poses a great challenge to the entire prevention and control. It resonates with the concept that the transmissibility increases while virulence decreases as virus spread [30] . As indicated by Tang's research, the L type of SARS-CoV-2 prevalent in the early stages of the outbreak in Wuhan, decreased after early January 2020, while the S type, which is less aggressive, have increased in relative frequency due to relatively weaker selective pressure [31] . Thus early detection and timely isolation is vital before a case becomes a cluster. It also raises the concern that the risk and benefit should be balanced in home quarantine for confirmed cases which could result in family case clusters. At present, symptomatic, support treatment and airway maintenance are the main treatments, as there is no proven effective antiviral therapy. It is claimed that kaletra, remdesivir and chloroquine phosphate have antiviral effects from preliminary studies [32, 33] , but the results of clinical trials are yet to be released. Patients in Guangzhou mainly use kaletra + arbidol, some with severe pulmonary inflammation added interferon atomized inhalation, which has also achieved good treatment effect. Nevertheless, further research with control groups would be helpful to differentiate whether the effect is caused by drugs or patients' self-recovery of the disease. Our study has limitations. First, the number of patients was small. Second, Wuhan cases are from published data, and more detailed information, such as the final prognosis of patients, could not be obtained. In summary, our results suggest that the virulence of SARA-CoV-2 is possibly waning in the process of transmission and the clustering occurrence is becoming the primary model of transmission. In addition, our observation that fecal virus RNA turned negative later than the nasopharyngeal swab justifies that the concern of faecal-oral transmission and suggest that fecal virus RNA should be assessed before lifting quarantine.

137248,"During an outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 with local transmission, an RSW to cohort all inpatients admitted from the community with respiratory symptoms may enhance case detection and reduce the potential of nosocomial transmission. 23 Despite the apparent low yield of testing in the RSW, our efforts were part of the national strategy of containment of this novel pathogen at that juncture of the outbreak. Our institution drew on experience with SARS, in which exposed patients were triaged, quarantined, and cohorted in open-plan wards, 24 to conceptualize the RSW. This approach allowed high-risk COVID-19 suspects to be prioritized for management in limited isolation facilities while maintaining vigilance by managing potentially at-risk patients in designated zones to contain the risk of nosocomial transmission. Aggressive case detection through screening of all patients presenting with acute respiratory infection has been advocated as a potential containment strategy. 11, 25 Our institution employed this strategy over a 6-week period, successfully containing a cluster of COVID-19 infection with potential nosocomial transmission and avoiding patient-HCW transmission amongst exposed staff. Although 5 previously unsuspected cases surfaced in the RSW over the 6-week period, only 13 patients were potentially exposed due to enhanced cohorting, whereas a single patient that surfaced in our institution's cohorted general ward resulted in the potential exposure of 18 patients. 18 Given the importance of adequate PPE, 26 even a single case of COVID-19 can result in the quarantine of large numbers of HCWs if detected late, further straining hospital resources. 27 However, our study also reflects the practicality and costs of such a resource-intensive effort. Beds set aside for the RSW comprised almost 10% of our institution's bed capacity. Beds were freed up by reducing elective surgery; however, this method would not be sustainable in the long run. Almost two-fifths of patients entering the RSW were subsequently deemed not to have pneumonia or URTI, despite being originally triaged to these wards from the ED. This was unavoidable as during the outbreak our ED needed to quickly admit patients with suspected respiratory symptoms rather than risk potential exposure in the crowded ED. The requirement for 2 negative tests 24 hours apart reduced bed turnover, reflecting the cost of an aggressive containment strategy. Several strategies might have reduced resource utilization; however, they would have compromised case detection. For instance, reducing the number of negative COVID-19 tests from 2 to 1 would have reduced testing yield 20 ; the first COVID-19 case detected in our RSW would have been missed using such an approach. Focusing on febrile patients, as in SARS, was also a consideration. 6 Only 40% of patients admitted to our RSW had fever (>37.9°C) at presentation to the ED. However, our first case did not present with fever and would have been missed using this strategy. Our study has several limitations. In our hospital, PCR testing for SARS-CoV-2 was utilized as a diagnostic modality. However, given that the diagnostic yield would likely be dependent on the quality and type of respiratory tract sample, as with other coronaviruses, 28 COVID-19 cases may have been missed due to sampling issues. Additionally, emerging data suggest the possibility of transmission in presymptomatic patients. 29 Patients with atypical symptoms and presymptomatic patients could have been missed, similar to our institution's experience with SARS, in which the index patient in our institution presented in a surgical ward. 30 Although we did not screen all admissions for COVID-19 due to the logistical challenges involved, 115 patients tested for SARS-CoV-2 did not have symptoms on admission and 378 patients were deemed not to have a diagnosis of pneumonia or URTI on evaluation in the RSW; none of these patients tested positive. A risk-stratified approach of limiting testing to patients with respiratory symptoms on admission, as well as patients who developed respiratory symptoms within a pre-defined incubation period, 22 might offer a balanced approach to containing COVID-19 during an outbreak with community transmission. In our institution, recognizing the possibility that not all COVID-19 patients may be contained within the isolation ward or RSW, the usage of surgical masks in all clinical areas was made a mandatory minimum for all HCWs. Our results also reflect the experience of a healthcare institution in a COVID-19 outbreak during which the prevailing national strategy was one of containment 13 ; exhaustive testing and surveillance may not be feasible in a healthcare system that is overwhelmed. 10 In conclusion, the strategy of using an RSW was successful in containing patients with COVID-19 in designated areas where enhanced PPE and infrastructural enhancements could potentially reduce nosocomial transmission. A strategy of testing all admitted patients with pneumonia/URTI picked up unsuspected cases of COVID-19, allowing for rapid institution of measures to reduce potential onward transmission.

137526,"BACKGROUND: Little is known about the natural history of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection or its contribution to infection transmission. METHODS: We conducted a prospective study at a quarantine center for COVID-19 in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam. We enrolled quarantined people with RT-PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, collecting clinical data, travel and contact history, and saliva at enrolment and daily nasopharyngeal throat swabs (NTS) for RT-PCR testing. We compared the natural history and transmission potential of asymptomatic and symptomatic individuals. RESULTS: Between March 10(th) and April 4(th), 2020, 14,000 quarantined people were tested for SARS-CoV-2; 49 were positive. Of these, 30 participated in the study: 13(43%) never had symptoms and 17(57%) were symptomatic. 17(57%) participants acquired their infection outside Vietnam. Compared with symptomatic individuals, asymptomatic people were less likely to have detectable SARS-CoV-2 in NTS samples collected at enrolment (8/13 (62%) vs. 17/17 (100%) P=0.02). SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in 20/27 (74%) available saliva; 7/11 (64%) in the asymptomatic and 13/16 (81%) in the symptomatic group (P=0.56). Analysis of the probability of RT-PCR positivity showed asymptomatic participants had faster viral clearance than symptomatic participants (P<0.001 for difference over first 19 days). This difference was most pronounced during the first week of follow-up. Two of the asymptomatic individuals appeared to transmit the infection to up to four contacts. CONCLUSIONS: Asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection is common and can be detected by analysis of saliva or NTS. NTS viral loads fall faster in asymptomatic individuals, but they appear able to transmit the virus to others.","RESULTS: Between March 10(th) and April 4(th), 2020, 14,000 quarantined people were tested for SARS-CoV-2; 49 were positive.<q>BACKGROUND: Little is known about the natural history of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection or its contribution to infection transmission.<q>Of these, 30 participated in the study: 13(43%) never had symptoms and 17(57%) were symptomatic.

137551,"Our results suggest that first state COVID-19 case announcements do lead to a widespread increase in the extent to which people seek out information about the epidemic. We find that announcements of first cases have the biggest effect on searches for basic information about the virus and its symptoms, suggesting that people attempt to educate themselves about COVID-19 and its effects. However, first case reports do not lead to a differential increase in searches involving large-scale NPIs (e.g., school and workplace closures) that will likely have important consequences for everyday life. This may be because first cases are reported relatively early in the epidemic when many of these more serious mitigation strategies are not yet part of public discourse. Finally, although one might expect official news to reduce concerns related to false messages, we do not find much indication that state announcements of first COVID-19 cases affect searches questioning whether the epidemic may be a hoax. Overall, our analysis of internet search data suggests that government information disclosure does help focus public attention on the crisis. Our evidence also indicates that people seem to mainly react by seeking information on what they can and should do in response to the epidemic. One conjecture is that policy makers may be able to take advantage of a brief period of active information seeking following focal events (first cases and first deaths) to provide clear advice regarding the actions people can undertake to avoid risk.

Many areas throughout the world are now experiencing the COVID 19 outbreaks with government and policy authorities taking many aggressive isolation or restriction measures, drastically reducing also patient’s visits and limiting only to the most urgent ones such as oncological visits or emergencies. Several studies have demonstrated a relationship between increased weight, obesity, diabetes, hypertension and inflammatory skin diseases. Furthermore, weight loss interventions have been shown to improve psoriasis, as well as hidradenitis suppurativa, and increase responsiveness to treatment of this conditions. We suppose that due to aggressive isolation or restriction measures, in the next future dermatologist will face with a common worsening of chronic skin inflammatory conditions due to reduced physical activities, increased intake of calories with the derived increase body weight and always more frequent treatment discontinuation.

139797,"Pandemics, like other disasters, have been a part of human history for centuries. However, response to pandemics necessarily differs as it requires separation, isolation and quarantine. Beyond the potential community protective effects attributed to quarantine, the risk to quarantined individuals needs to be identified [8] . This study in children and adolescents raises important concerns regarding the effectiveness and applicability of quarantine in recent era. Ministry of Health and Family Welfare of India directed in its advisory that asymptomatic contacts of potential Covid-19 patients were required to remain in quarantine for 14 d after their last exposure [1, 4] . It is obvious that implementation of quarantine for preventing transmission at community level will be only effective when we adhere to its compliance. But there are many limitations of such hypothetical agreement of quarantine adherence. As this study shows, compliance with all requirements was as low as 7.43%, indicating that quarantine in its present form would be of limited value in controlling transmission. Family members were at a higher risk since the compliance was only 17.35%. Compliance in relation to preventing community transmission was significantly higher (17.35%) than household transmission (10.71%). As a whole, most of the children and adolescents were non-compliant, potentially putting their family and community at risk. Results of present study in relation to compliance of quarantine requirements are lower than the previous studies [9, 10] . Unfortunately almost half were supposing that they were protecting themselves in quarantine (Table 1) . Here it is observed that there remains a significant chance of improvement in compliance. This can be achieved by improved knowledge about the disease and a better understanding of quarantine measures. A previous study reported that when asked about specific problems related to quarantine, the two most frequently cited ""major"" problems were emotional difficulties related to the confinement and not getting paid because they had to miss their duty [9] . In the present study the most common difficulty for children and adolescents was not going out to socialise. Children who were quarantined at facility/centre might be more susceptible to mental health problems than children who were quarantined at home because of their higher risk of infection and fear caused by parental separation [11, 12] , however, the authors did not analyse these relationship in their study. So beyond the potential community protecting effects attributed to quarantine, the risk of quarantined children needs to be identified. The consistency of the psychological problem in children and adolescents is very high in the present study group. In this study, most (around 68%) of quarantined children showed some or other form of psychological distress which is much higher than the non-quarantined group with statistically significant difference in most of the feelings (Table 2) . Other studies related to psychological impact in quarantined adults generally reported a high prevalence of symptoms of psychological distress like the present study. These studies reported emotional disturbance, depression, stress, low mood, irritability, insomnia, posttraumatic stress symptoms, anger and emotional exhaustion. Quarantine studies also found a range of other feelings such as, confusion, fear, anger, grief, numbness and anxiety related insomnia [8, 9, 13, 14] . A study on children also found that the mean post-traumatic stress scores were four times higher in children who had been quarantined to those who were not quarantined [8] . Long term behavior changes after the quarantine period, such as vigilant hand washing and avoidance of crowds have been reported [15] . However, point to be noted here is that non-quarantined children also show a higher level of stress during Covid-19 period. Previous studies from India have reported psychological distress in 13 to 45% of school children and adolescents [16, 17] . Higher level of psychological problems in these children can be attributed to restriction of activity, school closure and confinement at home due to nationwide lockdown. So, this study also provides comparable data of psychological impact of pandemic within the non-quarantined group. The distribution of different feelings and emotions in this study matches with previous studies [8, 9] though frequency of worry, helplessness and fear was much higher in the present study. On detailed interview, the authors found that children and their parents were more concerned about financial loss, loss of father's job, future uncertainties and unavailability of daily needs like food and water. Here, most children were related to families of migrant workers. Thus, socioeconomic and financial status of parents also has a significant role as a stressor in quarantine period. Financial loss, as a result of quarantine was found to be a risk factor for symptoms of psychological disorders, anger and anxiety [18, 19] . Although great efforts have been made by the Government of India across country, it is almost impossible to provide psychological interventions nationwide because most local support focuses only on meeting basic needs of children. In one study, inadequate basic supplies like food, water and clothes during quarantine was a source of frustration, anxiety and anger even after four to 6 mo after release [18] . To minimise the psychological effects we should increase children's access to disease information via comic books and videos and timely referral to psychiatrist. Social media could play an important role, allowing people who are quarantined to update their loved ones about themselves. So, having a working mobile phone is now a necessity, not a luxury. There are several limitations of this study. The sample size was small but it included wide range of adolescent age group. Socioeconomic details such as education and household income were not collected in the comparable group which could be helpful in planning future requirements in respect to quarantine. Furthermore, analysis of the quarantined household members and household composition was not done. This study relies on children's, adolescents' and their parents' retrospective perception of feelings and behaviors associated with stressful experiences which could be flawed due to recall bias and social desirability. In conclusion, this study suggests that understanding, compliance and knowledge regarding quarantine behavior is poor in the reported group; also the psychological impact of quarantine is wide ranging and substantial. Quarantine, in its present form, requires further research to its utility for assessing transmission of Covid-19 especially in a resource-limited country like ours. Revised requirements, improved preparation along with collaborative network of psychiatrists, psychotherapists, researchers and community volunteers can minimise the psychological impact of quarantine experiences.

140044,"Malaysia has implemented multiple measures to contain the Covid-19 pandemic since January 2020, culminating in the execution of the MCO. Though doubts on effectiveness of the MCO were raised at the early stage of its implementation as mass movements persisted, strict enforcement and improved awareness of the impacts of Covid-19 have brought significant improvement in compliance, which has been deemed the main reason behind the decrease in new Covid-19 cases since mid-April. Based on the downtrends of new and active Covid-19 cases, it can be concluded that the MCO has been effective, provided that compliance to the MCO is maintained. The Malaysian experience points to compliance and cooperation of the public as essential elements for the success of interventions by the government to contain Covid-19. Nonetheless, the socioeconomic implications of such interventions require attention and proper handling.

140101,"COVID-19's daily increasing cases and deaths have led to worldwide lockdown, quarantine and some restrictions. This study aims to analyze the effect of lockdown days on the spread of coronavirus in countries. COVID-19 cases and lockdown days data were collected for 49 countries that implemented the lockdown between certain dates (without interruption). The correlation tests were used for data analysis based on unconstrained (normal) and constrained (Tukey-lambda). The lockdown days was significantly correlated with COVID-19 pandemic based on unconstrained (r = −0.9126, F-ratio = 6.1654; t-ratio = 2.40; prob > .0203 with 49 observations) and based on Tukey-lambda (r = 0.7402, λ = 0.14). The lockdown, one of the social isolation restrictions, has been observed to prevent the COVID-19 pandemic, and showed that the spread of the virus can be significantly reduced by this preventive restriction in this study. This study offers initial evidence that the COVID-19 pandemic can be suppressed by a lockdown. The application of lockdown by governments is also thought to be effective on psychology, environment and economy besides having impact on Covid-19.","COVID-19 cases and lockdown days data were collected for 49 countries that implemented the lockdown between certain dates (without interruption).<q>COVID-19's daily increasing cases and deaths have led to worldwide lockdown, quarantine and some restrictions.<q>This study aims to analyze the effect of lockdown days on the spread of coronavirus in countries.

These are science informed policy questions that will have to take into consideration a large degree of uncertainties in outcomes. The first question is on when to lift the Enhanced Community Quarantine (ECQ) as informed by epidemiological modelling. The second deals on how the Philippines can respond to a future pandemic crisis. We review the Philippine government's responses and introduce the complicating scientific, social, and political contexts for both questions and address proposals for strengthening the science advisory structures. We propose a permanent science advisory body for emergencies with the widest source of expertise as needed.","ABSTRACT In this paper we examine two policy questions about the COVID 19 pandemic in the Philippines.<q>These are science informed policy questions that will have to take into consideration a large degree of uncertainties in outcomes.<q>The first question is on when to lift the Enhanced Community Quarantine (ECQ) as informed by epidemiological modelling.

140874,"The rapid expansion of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been observed in many parts of the world. Many newly reported cases of COVID-19 during early outbreak phases have been associated with travel history from an epidemic region (identified as imported cases). For those cases without travel history, the risk of wider spreads through community contact is even higher. However, most population models assume a homogeneous infected population without considering that the imported and secondary cases contracted by the imported cases can pose different risks to community spread. We have developed an “easy-to-use” mathematical framework extending from a meta-population model embedding city-to-city connections to stratify the dynamics of transmission waves caused by imported, secondary, and others from an outbreak source region when control measures are considered. Using the cumulative number of the secondary cases, we are able to determine the probability of community spread. Using the top 10 visiting cities from Wuhan in China as an example, we first demonstrated that the arrival time and the dynamics of the outbreaks at these cities can be successfully predicted under the reproduction number R(0) = 2.92 and incubation period τ = 5.2 days. Next, we showed that although control measures can gain extra 32.5 and 44.0 days in arrival time through an intensive border control measure and a shorter time to quarantine under a low R(0) (1.4), if the R(0) is higher (2.92), only 10 extra days can be gained for each of the same measures. This suggests the importance of lowering the incidence at source regions together with infectious disease control measures in susceptible regions. The study allows us to assess the effects of border control and quarantine measures on the emergence and global spread of COVID-19 in a fully connected world using the dynamics of the secondary cases.","The rapid expansion of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been observed in many parts of the world.<q>Many newly reported cases of COVID-19 during early outbreak phases have been associated with travel history from an epidemic region (identified as imported cases).<q>We have developed an “easy-to-use” mathematical framework extending from a meta-population model embedding city-to-city connections to stratify the dynamics of transmission waves caused by imported, secondary, and others from an outbreak source region when control measures are considered.

141595,"After the first case of COVID-19 was detected in New York on March 1, 2020, there continues to be a rapid increase in the number of infections and deaths in the ensuing weeks. As of April 26, 2020, there were 288,045 positive cases in the state of New York. There were 16,966 COVID-19related deaths reported with two fatalities in children younger than 10 years (further details on mortality not available). We describe a case of neonatal COVID-19 infection during the early weeks of recognized widespread community transmission in New York. To the best of our knowledge, this is one of the first few reported neonatal cases of COVID-19 infection in the United States. SARS-CoV-2, belonging to the genus Betacoronavirus, is a single-stranded ribonucleic acid (RNA) virus. The virus is transmitted across humans, primarily through respiratory droplets and contact. Infants and children affected by this virus usually have a history of exposure to a sick contact. There is no clear evidence of vertical transmission despite some reports suggesting this possibility in neonates [3] [4] [5] . The median incubation period is five days with a range of two to 14 days [6] . To date, there are 11 published cases of neonatal COVID-19 detected by SARS-CoV-2 PCR [3] [4] [5] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] . Six of them presented within three days of life whereas the others presented between five and 28 days of life. Seven out of the 11 neonates had fever as the presenting complaint. Eight of the neonates were born to mothers who tested positive for COVID-19. The clinical characteristics of eight infants, along with the infant described in the current report, are summarized in Table 2 . Complete details on the other three cases were not available and hence not included in the table. Three separate neonates with COVID-19 presenting within the first two days of life were also reported in media, complete details of which were not available. Serological evidence of COVID-19 with elevated immunoglobulin-M levels was shown in three neonates but with negative PCR testing [12] [13] . There is a lack of definitive evidence pointing towards in utero SARS-CoV-2 transmission at this time [14] . Patek et al. (10) Coronado et al. [15] . The common clinical manifestations of fever, cough, or shortness of breath were observed only in 73% of the cases, indicating that children may not always present with the classic symptoms, unlike adults. The severity of illness and the rates of hospitalization were disproportionately higher among infants in the above studies. Fever appears to be the main presenting symptom of COVID-19 in a majority of the neonates described in the literature so far (8 of 12, 66%) and the prognosis seems to be good [3] [4] [5] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] . In summary, even though infants appear to be at a higher risk of severe illness, neonates tend to have a milder infection based on the very limited number of cases published so far. Data from large studies involving adult cases of COVID-19 indicate that the frequent laboratory abnormalities seen in these patients include lymphocytopenia, thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, and elevated inflammatory markers [16] . Laboratory abnormalities of neonatal COVID-19 patients discussed in this review are available in Table 1 . It remains to be seen from larger studies if infected neonates mount the same response as adults, and if the response pattern is the same in neonates presenting early versus late. Thus, based on the limited data available so far, we postulate that neonatal infection can be early-onset (first three days after birth) or late-onset (4-28 days of life). The majority of the cases are due to horizontal spread. At this time, data suggesting the possibility of vertical transmission is equivocal [5, 14, 17] . Data on serological testing from larger cohorts will give more insight into the transmission patterns. There is no evidence that this infection can be transmitted through breast milk [17] . There are several hypotheses explaining the reason for neonates being at lower risk for severe COVID-19. One hypothesis is related to the maturation and functioning of receptors. Angiotensin-converting-enzyme 2 has been proven to be the principal target of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. In neonates, it is possible that the receptor activity is immature or there is an increase in angiotensin-converting-enzyme 2 activity [18] . Another postulation is a higher CD4 to CD8 ratio in neonates. It has been observed that older males with COVID-19 infection had a low CD4 count. Infants, on the other hand, have a high CD4 to CD8 ratio [19] . This change in lymphocyte proportion is related to the changes and involution of thymus in infants. The protective role of maternal antibodies acquired transplacentally is also to be studied. There are also reports of thrombotic complications contributing to the mortality and morbidity in adult COVID-19 patients [20] . If this is true, the possible role of fetal hemoglobin in the milder presentation of COVID-19 in neonates needs to be further explored. The management of a severe COVID-19 infection is still evolving. Remdesivir, an adenosine analog that incorporates into RNA and causes premature termination, is a promising antiviral agent, with preliminary reports suggesting clinical benefit in adult patients. It is available through compassionate use, as well as emergency authorization use, for neonates. Another promising option is convalescent plasma obtained from patients who have recovered from COVID-19 infection with detectable antibodies. It is available as part of clinical trials in many centers. At the beginning of the outbreak, hydroxychloroquine was used as a first-line agent, however, there is insufficient data to suggest any benefit. In addition, COVID-19 pneumonia is associated with a severe inflammatory response, including high pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-6 (IL-6). An IL-6 monoclonal antibody, tocilizumab, is being used as part of clinical trials with benefit. Based on the limited evidence available at this time, the probable mode of transmission of neonatal COVID-19 appears to be horizontal while vertical transmission is a possibility in early-onset infections. Fever is one of the main presenting symptoms of neonatal COVID-19 and its testing should be considered in the evaluation of a febrile infant presenting to the emergency department. Infected infants can shed the virus through the respiratory tract as well as in stool. Thereby, caregivers should take caution with good hand hygiene, particularly when changing diapers. Thus, prompt recognition of illness in this population is essential to limit further transmission in the community. Finally, it is important to understand that these conclusions are based on limited data and our understanding will continue to evolve.

141621,"Since the outbreak of the novel coronavirus in December 2019, the pandemic which started as a very contagious domestic epidemic gave rise to an emergency situation where critical decisions were demanded for. The virus was novel and very little information was known about the epidemic at the early stage. With incomplete information, limited data on hand, and ever changing on the epidemic development, it is extremely hard for anybody to decide using only deterministic approach which foretells precisely the future behaviour of the epidemic. The work reported in this paper is focused on solving the problem of incomplete data available for stochastic decision making. In this paper a composite Monte-Carlo model (CMCM) is proposed to be used in conjunction with GROOMS methodology [23] which finds the best performing deterministic forecasting algorithm. Coupling GROOMS+CMCM together offers the flexibility of embracing both deterministic and non-deterministic input data into the Monte Carlo simulation where random samples are drawn from the distributions of the data from the nondeterministic data sources for reliable outputs. During the early period of disease outbreaks, data are scarce and full of uncertainty. The advantage of CMC is that a range of possible outcomes are generated associated with probabilities. Subsequently sensitivity analysis, what-if analysis and other scenario planning can be done for decision support. As a part of the GROOMS+CMCM methodology, fuzzy rule induction is also proposed, which provides another dimension of insights in the form of decision rules for decision support. A case study of the recent novel coronavirus epidemic (which are also known as Wuhan coronavirus, COVID-19 or 2019-nCoV) is used as an example in demonstrating the efficacy of GROOMS+CMCM. Through the experimentation over the empirical COVID-19 data collected from the Chinese government agency, it was found that the outcomes generated from Monte Carlo simulation are superior to the traditional methods. A collection of soft computing techniques, such as BFGS+PNN, Fuzzy Rule Induction, and other supporting algorithms to GROOMS+CMCM could be able to produce qualitative results for better decision support, when used together with Monte Carlo simulation, than any of deterministic forecasters alone. Forecasting carries very high uncertainty; the forecast results are much influenced by government policy and human intervention factors. The essence is to obtain the most accurate possible results given what is available in the current situation. The main contribution of our methodology is not to pursue an upmost accurate forecasting model; rather, it is on about fusing deterministic and non-deterministic data series into a MC simulation for fuzzy decision making. The experiment reported in this paper represents a typical scenario of decision making for a novel disease in the early days since the outbreak. It does not mean to describe how this COVID-19 progressed, as it still evolves at the time of writing. However, it shows a possible solution in generating future outcomes from the GROOMS+CMCM when the data is limited and incomplete. Early decision making is critical in the initial stage of novel epidemic, using multi-prong data sources, from both deterministic and nondeterministic domains. GROOMS+CMCM was designed to fulfil this solution.

141858,"In current work, we used modeling-based approaches to investigate the impact of asymptomatic and imported cases on the potentially new outbreaks. We developed a model with two novel features: which is consistent with a recent report. 19 From the sensitivity analysis, we found that regulating β 2 or β 3 alone plays neglectable role to block coronavirus outbreak. There is no feasible way to alter total population S and discharge rate λ either. The seemingly only way to impede viral transmission is simultaneously lowering mutual contacts (β i ). We found that the latent periods and outbreak sizes are remarkably sensitive to the contact factor F (note that the surface plot was removed if there was no predicted outbreak). Under strong interventions (F approaches 1), our model predictions suggested that even a total of 500 imported or ASP will not lead to coronavirus outbreak ( Figures 5 and 6 tests should be used for individuals in dense populations (eg, students, teachers, or health-care workers). The extensive tests may help to identify the hidden ASP to impede potential outbreaks. Since April 1, China has begun to include detected asymptomatic cases in daily report. 24 Therefore, strong interventions should be taken especially for ASP owing to the unpredictable and covert features. Liu et al 25 recently showed a model with ""asymptomatic patients."" However, the ""asymptomatic patients"" all become diagnosed ones with symptoms and are more likely to be ""pre-symptomatic."" 26 This is in contrast with the recent definition for ASP. [19] [20] [21] Our model also has limitations. We did not incorporate death into our model similar to some recent models. 8  Despite the limitations above, the current study faithfully fits the epidemic data. Our model has predicted that the asymptomatic cases are factors with higher risk compared with imported cases and emphasized the critical role of strict interventions. The demographic stochasticity is worthy of further investigations using stochastic models. ACKNOWLEDGMENT This work is supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China (31971185, 31970897).

142335,"In the present case series, we reported a super-spreader who transmitted the SARS-CoV-2 virus to twenty-eight individuals and caused twenty-seven COVID-19 cases and an asymptomatic case. Furthermore, another forty-nine individuals were infected by the twenty-eight individuals (thirty-nine COVID-19 cases and ten asymptomatic cases). Fortunately, aggressive contact tracing and testing adopted by our government stopped the SES from further spreading [6] . This case arouses the concern regarding the reason behind the super-spreading ability and highlights the importance of identifying and quarantining any one in close contact with a confirmed COVID-19 patient as soon as possible. Ms. S is a patient in moderate case, which is defined as with respiratory symptoms and pulmonary inflammatory lesion. To understand the reasons underlying the effective transmission ability, we summarized the SARS-CoV-2 viral load in sputum and throat swab samples from Ms. S during her thirty-five days (From January 27 to March 2) in our hospital (Fig. 2) . Ct values are inversely correlated with viral RNA copy number, with Ct value of 30.76, 27.67 and 24.56 corresponding to a gene copy number of 1.5 × 10 4 , 1.5 × 10 5 and 1.5 × 10 6 . The viral load in samples from Ms. S. was high and her virus shedding time was long (40 days, from January 19 to February 27). Additionally, all close contacts of Ms. S (From January 17 to January 27) were isolated and observed for fourteen days, and only her daughter, her husband and twenty-five pilgrims mentioned above including twenty-two pilgrims in the same tour bus with her was infected by SARS-CoV-2, indicating a closed and small space is necessary for high transmission efficiency. Besides, consistent with previous study, we observed a COVID-19 transmission within a family cluster by pre-symptomatic infectors in the SES, indicating the possibility of COVID-19 transmission before symptom onset [7] . Also, we observed a transmission carried by an asymptomatic case [8] , and it is suggested that the infectiousness of an asymptomatic case is comparative to a symptomatic case [3] . However, the infectiousness of an asymptomatic case is still debatable. Limitations of the present should be noted. Firstly, monitoring for genetic adaptation could help to determine whether transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 is evolving and whether variants of the virus are more readily transmitted. However, neither data by wholegenome sequencing nor epidemiologic investigation was available. Secondly, host, pathogens, environmental, and behavioral features of superspreading event were mentioned in the present study. However, detailed information regarding each factor should be further explored. Lastly, despite great effort we have done, the confirmation of the index case is still controversial, more evidence should be added to determine the index case in the SES. The current case and another previously published one during the SARS outbreak [9] suggest that a super-spreader may have the following features: (1) high viral load; (2) longer virus shedding time; (3) a super spreader may not be a severely ill patient, he/she may be active in social activities and have chances to contact many persons within a short period of time. On the other hand, finding out a super spreader may be difficult. Timely tracking each confirmed and suspected patient's recent activities, places visited, and events participated is important. For confirmed patients, timely isolation, without allowing them to attend any social activities, and continuous monitoring their virus load/virus shedding is also important.

142372,"The prevalence rates of anxiety and depression were approximately 8.3% and 14.6%, respectively, in this study, which is lower than that reported in studies of other health emergencies. For example, 39% the public expressed anxiety about avian influenza in France [18] , 48% of the general public had anxiety-depression symptoms after over 1 year of Ebola outbreak in Sierra Leone [19] , 73% of residents had low mood and 57% had irritability during the SARS outbreak in Hong Kong [20] , 16% of the public felt anxious during the early stage of the influenza A (H1N1) outbreak in the Netherlands [21] , and the percentage of 'very' or 'fairly' worried people in the general population fluctuated between 9.6% and 32.9% during the swine flu outbreak in the UK [22] . Possible reasons for these differences are as follows. First, the Chinese government took quick and strong measures to ensure citizens' sense of security and frequently disseminated situation updates of COVID-19. Rapidly sharing information about the epidemic is an effective way to reduce public panic [23] . Second, people have a high cognitive level of COVID-19. The general population's level of knowledge about the disease plays an important role in reaction to an epidemic crisis [18, 24] . In our study, 77.3% of participants thought they had a higher level of knowledge about COVID-19, and the result is consistent with the knowledge test on COVID-19 (the total score was 20), on which 70.13% scored above 15 [25] . Third, China quickly established a psychological assistance system, and 40.4% of participants in this study had received psychological support or counseling. The system might be an effective way to relieve negative emotions of the public. Finally, a possible reason might be the use of different instruments and cut-off points to measure anxiety and depression, different stages of epidemic development, exposure to different epidemics, different study designs, and different cultural backgrounds. However, our estimates are higher than those found in another study that found a 3.7% prevalence of depression symptoms in the general population right after the SARS epidemic in Taiwan [6] . A possible explanation is that people's negative psychological response to the epidemic decreased during the course of the outbreak, and other studies have reported a similar conclusion [26, 27] . In the affected group, the prevalence rates of anxiety and depression were approximately 12.9% and 22.4%, respectively, presenting a prevalence of anxiety higher than the reported 7.6% of the public who had contact with Middle East Respiratory Syndrome patients and who showed anxiety symptoms in e924609-9 South Korea [28] . In the unaffected group, the prevalence rates of anxiety and depression were approximately was 6.7% and 11.9%, significantly lower than in the affected group. This finding is consistent with those reported by other studies. Ko et al. demonstrated that people presenting isolation behavior had higher level of depressive during the SARS epidemic [6] . Jalloh et al. reported that knowing someone quarantined for Ebola was independently associated with anxiety-depression [19] . In total, 34% of horse owners who were quarantined had high psychological distress during the equine influenza outbreak compared with the general population in Australia [29] . In situations where quarantine is considered necessary, a recent review suggests that officials should quarantine each person for no longer than required, provide a clear explanation for quarantine and information about protocols, and make sure that sufficient supplies are guaranteed [30] . In the affected group, the high level of anxiety was correlated with low average household income. The impact of COVID-19 is not only psychological but also economic. Those with low average household income lack the ability to face economic risks; in addition, being quarantined means that they are unable to deal with financial problems by going back to work or applying for a loan, and they cannot estimate how long this impact may last. These may be factors that triggered more anxiety and depression.  This study aimed to assess and compare the prevalence and associated factors of anxiety and depression among the public affected by quarantine and unaffected during the COVID-19 outbreak in southwestern China in early Feb. 2020. The findings showed that the prevalence of anxiety and depression of the affected group are higher than unaffected group. The main factors associated with anxiety and depression in the 2 groups included the severe property damage and low self-perceived health condition. The economic support and medical support should be paid more attention to by the government to improve general population's mental state. ","The prevalence rates of anxiety and depression were approximately 8.<q>3% and 14.6%, respectively, in this study, which is lower than that reported in studies of other health emergencies. For example, 39% the public expressed anxiety about avian influenza in France [18] , 48% of the general public had anxiety-depression symptoms after over 1 year of Ebola outbreak in Sierra Leone [19] , 73% of residents had low mood and 57% had irritability during the SARS outbreak in Hong Kong [20] , 16% of the public felt anxious during the early stage of the influenza A (H1N1) outbreak in the Netherlands [21] , and the percentage of 'very' or 'fairly' worried people in the general population fluctuated between 9.<q>A possible explanation is that people's negative psychological response to the epidemic decreased during the course of the outbreak, and other studies have reported a similar conclusion [26, 27] .

142667,"Abstract The assessment of the incubation period, which is the period between the infection and the illness onset, is essential to identify the sufficient isolation period for infectious diseases. In South Korea, a few cases of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) were identified after the 14-day self-quarantine program, and the length of this quarantine has raised controversial issues for the Korean public health professionals. We estimated the COVID-19 incubation period using the log-normal distribution from publicly available data. The data were obtained from the press release of the Busan city department of public health and news reports. We collected and analysed information for 47 patients with a median age of 30. We estimated that the median incubation period was three days (95% Confidence Interval, 0.6–8.2). We also did not find any significant difference in the incubation period between males and females. Our findings indicate that a 14-day self-quarantine program should be sufficient to prevent spreading in the infection of suspected individuals with COVID-19 in the community.","Abstract The assessment of the incubation period, which is the period between the infection and the illness onset, is essential to identify the sufficient isolation period for infectious diseases.<q>In South Korea, a few cases of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) were identified after the 14-day self-quarantine program, and the length of this quarantine has raised controversial issues for the Korean public health professionals.<q>We estimated that the median incubation period was three days (95% Confidence Interval, 0.

142700,"The worldwide spread of the SARS-CoV-2 infection led the Italian Government to apply unprecedented containment measures. The Decree of the Italian Prime Minister of March 20, 2020 has been issued to state an absolute ban to get away from their home, except to make essential work or activities. Quarantine has upset the normality of Italian daily life, forcing population to social distancing and self-isolation. The precautionary measures have also involved sport-related activities, including walking and running outside. Therefore, home workout remained the only possibility to play sports and stay active during Covid-19 pandemic. In the present work, we analyzed the total MET-min/wk before-and during COVID-19 quarantine and assess the relationship with the psychological well-being of 2524 participants, of which 41.76% was classified as a highly active group. Certainly, our study sample is very limited as compared to other work present in the current literature, such as the work by Jin and coauthors which included more than 500000 individuals, even if the treated topic was different [28] . To date, in Italy is not present a national health monitoring and surveillance system for physical activity, and no studies have collected large data showing the different activity levels of the general public [29] . However, data for the years 2010-2013 from the survey by the Italian Ministry of Health's Behavioural Risk Factor Surveillance System (Progressi delle Aziende Sanitarie per la Salute in Italia (PASSI)) [30] , showed that 36% of Italian adults of 30-60 years and 24% of older adults of aged 60 þ years meet the recommended physical activity levels. Moreover, in line with our results, a very recent study conducted on Sicilian population [31] , showed that before COVID-19 quarantine, 44% and 50% of participants were moderate active and high active, respectively. Although the scientific community has highlighted the real benefits to stay active during the pandemic, our results showed a strong reduction of physical activity levels, especially for vigorous activity and walking. These data reflect the major difficulties to walk and perform an intense exercise at home, compared to moderate activity. The WHO recommends practising at least 150 min per week of moderate to vigorous-intensity physical activity or 75 min of high intensity per week, or a combination of both [29, 32] . Although running, fast swimming, playing basketball, soccer, represent vigorous-intensity activities burn more than 3000 MET-minutes/week, many other intense exercises can be performed staying at home, such as carrying/moving heavy load (>20 kg) or stair walking. Stairs can be found in most private homes, and stair climbing (at least 10 min per day) is considered a vigorous-intensity activity [33] . An opposite trend was found for subjects classified as low active before COVID-19, whose total physical activity energy expenditure during quarantine significantly increased. This phenomenon could be due to a radical change in everyday schedules and habits. People remaining at home spend much more time in low-intensity activities like housework (cooking, washing dishes or gardening). Another reason could be the greater female presence in the study that is generally more prone to do low-intensity activities. Our study also showed that during the pandemic, the physical activity levels significantly decreased in all age groups considered. Moreover, the male group showed highly significant variation between before and during COVID-19 emergency as compared to the female group. Previous works have largely indicated gender differences in exercise habits and motivations for exercise [34, 35, 36, 37] . Men practice physical activity mainly for social and competitive reasons. Moreover, they prefer to practice sports, outdoor and/or in public places like the gym and fitness clubs. Females are more inclined to exercise in home-setting, practising aerobics, dancing, yoga, pilates or circuits with push-ups, squats, planks and jumping jacks. Furthermore, the lower variation in physical activity levels between before and during quarantine found in women is possibly explained by the higher amount of housework physical activity than males [37, 38] . Secondly, we investigated the impact of physical activity on psychological well-being during the pandemic. Our results showed that the reduction of physical activity levels is ever related to the worse status of psychological well-being. The positive effects of regular physical activity on psychological health are indisputable in the field of modern medicine. Regular exercise improves one's self-esteem and a sense of well-being. Individuals who exercise regularly exhibit fewer depressive and anxiety symptoms, thus supporting the concept that physical activity provides a beneficial effect against the development of mental disorders [39] . Several studies have demonstrated that the anxiolytic effects of regular exercise are linked to change in hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and mediation of the 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59  60  61  62  63  64  65  66  67 endogenous opioid system, which are involved in stress reactivity, anxiety, mood and emotional responses [40, 41, 42] . Furthermore, physical activity is implicated in the modulation of different trophic factors, such as brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). BDNF, whose levels are upregulated following exercise, represents the most abundant neurotrophin in the brain, which positively influences both anxiety and depressive disorders [43] . We found that the correlation between the reduction of physical activity and psychological well-being is stronger in the female group. Previous studies have examined gender differences between measures of physical fitness and life satisfaction, that is one of the central constructs in the field of positive psychology. Although most of them reflecting no difference between genders and life satisfaction, some works demonstrated higher life satisfaction measures among females when compared with males. This evidence suggests that reduction of physical activity levels may mostly influence mental well-being of female group [44, 45, 46, 47] . The current study also showed a significant correlation between the change in total activity and the PGWBI score in subjects classified as high active and moderate active as well as in the young adult group. The latter result is supported by previous studies demonstrating the strong relationship between physical activity and psychological well-being in this age group [47, 48, 49] . Although the negative impact on psychological well-being due to the reduction of physical activity levels is a dogma, currently in the literature there is only one study conducted in Canada that can strengthen our present results, regarding the worsen of psychophysical conditions during a period of forced rest due to a pandemic [50] . Generally, it is the individual to choose if perform or not physical activity, but the COVID-19 spread changed the world. Gyms, stadiums, pools, dance and fitness studios, physiotherapy centres, parks and playgrounds were closed, compelling people to find alternatives to exercise. Consequently, different life habits have been affected, with the modification of routines of mobility, physical activity, and habitual exercise protocols. Under such unusual conditions, barriers to keep an active life's style were hard to overcome. For the above reasons, we studied the impact of physical activity on psychological health during Covid-19 pandemic in Italy. The benefits of exercise are proven very helpful, especially in times of anxiety, crisis and fear. There are concerns therefore that, in the context of the pandemic, lack of access to regular sporting or exercise routines resulted in challenges to the immune system, physical health, including by leading to the commencement of or exacerbating existing diseases that have their roots in a sedentary lifestyle. Lack of access to exercise and physical activity had also mental health impacts, compound stress or anxiety that many experienced in the face of isolation from normal social life. Possible loss of family or friends from the virus and impact of the virus on one's economic well-being and access to nutrition exacerbated these effects. The limitations of this study included the over-reporting bias of physical activity as well as to report at the same time point, information related to exercise levels before-and during COVID-19. However, IPAQ questionnaires may supply a reliable approximation of physical activity at a population level, and its validity has been confirmed in different studies [51, 52] . In conclusion, our results, for the first time in the literature, have shown that quarantine in Italy induces a significant reduction of total weekly physical activity energy expenditure in all age groups and especially in men, and this reduction negatively affects the psychological well-being. In fact, physical activity has a profoundly positive impact on psychological health, by enhancing self-esteem and resilience to stress and reducing depression and anxiety. Given the spread of COVID-19, stay at home is a fundamental step to halt the pandemic. However, the clinical relevance of the present study denotes that maintaining regular physical activity is an important preventive strategy for physical and mental health during a forced rest period like the current coronavirus emergency. Then ""stay active to feel better"".

142807,"From all the results in Section 3, we estimate peak periods and summarise other details in Table 4 . In the 2003 SARS outbreak, peak periods lasted for around 60 days in Hong Kong, Singapore and Taiwan; they were longer in China and Canada. In most areas, local governments applied relevant lockdown measures such as school closures, especially in China, Hong Kong and Singapore, although only several schools were closed in Canada and there were no school closures in Taiwan at all. Mortality rates tend to be between 10% to 17% till 11 July; the worst is around 17% in Hong Kong and Canada, yet China's is only 6.6%. Hong Kong and Singapore present good cured rates which are more than 82%, with China's at 92.9%. Singapore and Canada have the highest HCW infected rates, which are more than 41%. (All data in experiments are before 05 July.) There are also some issues found: There is a lack of data to show the impact of school closures in the SARS outbreak, however. Through the experiments, we finalised graphs for visual analysis of the SARS outbreak from five major features. This work is not medical and/or clinical; all outcomes were based entirely on data analysis. Hence, this work is for people who have an interest and addresses final statistical data rather than virology knowledge. We do obtain some insights from the complex raw data via visual analysis, and the visualisation methods could be useful for related research. Since many researchers are interested in COVID-19 studies at this particular period, this work may offer some different views on it. This is also our future work, applying the current research methodology to COVID-19 data analysis, and seeing if we can discover something new in the COVID-19 outbreak from a visual analysis perspective.

143168,"SD measures have been implemented to different degrees by countries and regions affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. Interventions have been most stringent in Hubei province (China), where intensive travel restrictions have affected 40-60 million residents 16, 17 Many SD interventions have focused on public messaging to encourage positive behaviour change. For example, encouraging individuals to work remotely, avoid crowded areas, and restrict non-essential travel. As such interventions are not enforced, its effectiveness will be dependent on public compliance. A recent YouGov survey found that risk perception differed by country 24 . A higher proportion of respondents in Asian countries reported being concerned about their risk of being infected compared to European or North American countries. This is also reflected in self-reported positive behaviour changes. A majority of respondents in Asia surveyed reported avoiding crowded places (e.g. 83% in Hong Kong). Advocating for remote working have led to the greatest positive behavior in mainland China and Hong Kong, with 67% and 45% reportedly avoiding going to the office, respectively. These high figures compared to other countries in Asia may be due to implementation of remote working for government offices. Outside of Hubei province, China where the long-term implementation of substantial SD layered with the strict movement restrictions in Wuhan City and Hubei have reduced the reproduction number R 0 , estimated to be greater than 2 during the early stages of the outbreak, it is likely too early to be able to evaluate or quantify the true effectiveness of specific SD interventions on the epidemic in affected countries or regions 25-27 . Indeed as most countries have implemented a range of nonpharmaceutical measures such as travel restrictions, health screenings, and advice such as hand and cough hygiene intended to prompt behaviour change, it is difficult to quantify the effectiveness of SD in the absence of other control  No competing interests were disclosed.

143772,"To the extent that interventions based on contact tracing can be implemented, they can help mitigate the spread of COVID-19. Our results suggest that individual quarantine may contain an outbreak of COVID-19 with a short serial interval (4.8 days) only in settings with high intervention performance where at least three-quarters of infected contacts are individually quarantined. However, in settings where this performance is unrealistically high and the outbreak of COVID-19 continues to grow, so too will the burden of the number of contacts traced for active monitoring or quarantine. In such circumstances where resources are prioritized for scalable interventions such as social distancing, 16 we show active monitoring or individual quarantine of high-risk contacts can contribute synergistically with social distancing. There may be such synergy in the data released by the WHO mission to China in February 2020. 17 In Guangdong, WHO reports that the proportion of fever clinic testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 declined from 0.47% on 30 January to 0.02% on 16 February, during a period of intensive social distancing interventions. 17 If one assumes that these social distancing interventions reduced transmission of nearly all infections that could cause attendance at a fever clinic, one might expect a lower total number of attendees, with proportionate declines in all infectious fever causes that are affected by social distancing. If one assumes that most fever causes are affected by social distancing, the declining proportion of SARS-CoV-2 among fever cases may reflect the benefits of interventions aimed specifically at this infection, which is to say case-based interventions like active monitoring, individual quarantine, and isolation. The effectiveness of individual quarantine versus active monitoring, targeted by contact tracing, heavily depends on the assumptions regarding the serial interval, the amount of transmission that occurs prior to symptom onset, and the feasibility setting. Under our fitted disease natural history parameters for serial interval scenario 1, with a shorter mean serial interval and hence substantial presymptomatic infectiousness, individual quarantine was considerably more effective than active monitoring at reducing onward transmission by an infected contact. To offset this relative benefit of individual quarantine compared to active monitoring, perverse incentives to avoid quarantine would have to be correspondingly larger. Both scenarios were fit using an incubation period with mean = 5.2 days among 451 lab-confirmed cases from Wuhan; 12 other recent estimates of the incubation period of COVID-19 include a mean of 6.4 7 .

144124,"This follow-up study reports the largest cohort so far regarding the posthospitalization features of COVID-19 patients. We have systematically tracked the clinical characteristics in terms of symptoms, laboratory tests, chest CT images and treatment of the discharged COVID-19 patients in a time frame of 4 weeks. The distribution of quarantine locations as well as contact history post discharge was also investigated. Our retrospective analyses of 131 discharged patients reconfirmed that the majority of severe COVID-19 patients (82.61%) were clustered above of 40 years old [2-5, 7, 8] , with the median age notably older than the non-severe patients (60 years versus 38 years). Hypertension and coronary artery disease were prominent comorbidities of COVID-19, with the most common onset symptoms of fever (87.02%) followed by cough (56.49%), fatigue (27.48%) and dyspnea (25.95%), particularly for those severe ones (Supplementary Table 1) , which was similar to previous reports [5, 7, 9] . In this follow-up study, we have observed that the majority of patients with COVID-19, both in severe and non-severe groups, were on the course of recovery after discharge. This could be evidenced by the mitigation of overall symptoms, and improved chest CT diagnosis during the course of 4 weeks of post-hospitalization period ( Table 2 and 3) . Although prominent onset symptoms such as fever, fatigue and dyspnea were significantly alleviated, some residual symptoms such as cough (29.01%), expectoration (6.11%) and chest tightness (6.11%), dyspnea (3.82%), etc were still visible at the time of discharge. The incidence of such symptoms consistently diminished during the following 4 weeks of recovery course, as detailed in Supplementary Table 2 . Indeed, relatively persistent cough and/or dyspnea of the patients after discharge were merely mild, bothering neither daily activities nor sleep. Besides, we have found that post-discharge treatments, particularly after the second week, were mainly anti-symptomatic or supportive. Additional treatments were barely reported from the patients. Our data, from symptomatic perspective, confirmed the adequacy of current discharge criteria. However, 11 patients were surprisingly associated with recurrent but transient fever in the first or second week post discharge. 6 of them underwent SARS-CoV-2 reexamination with 2 positive presented (Patient 2 and 3 in Table 5 ). Further follow-up found that Patient 2 was associated with chest CT abnormality as recurred and aggregated bilateral ground glass opacities (Fig. 2D) , and was redirected to the designated hospital for the extended observation. He resolved with three times of negative SARS-CoV-2 tests and improved chest CT (Table 5 , Fig. 2F ) in the next 3 weeks without obvious symptoms after appropriate treatment. Taking clinical features together, it was suspected that COVID-19 was recurrent in this particular patient. Whereas Patient 3 was asymptomatic except transient fever, with SARS-CoV-2 test turning negative 3 weeks after discharge without specialized treatment. The other febrile patients who were quarantined either at home or at designated locations were absent of respiratory symptoms in next few weeks. These results suggested that post discharge fever may point to the recurrence of COVID-19, thus cautions must be taken with necessary retest of SARS-CoV-2 and chest CT. Notably, 8 out of 131 patients were positive in the SARS-CoV-2 retest after discharge. They were all affirmatively quarantined either in designated hospital or community spot without contact any other persons at least for 2 weeks, since positive SARS-CoV-2 identified. Among them, 1 patient was febrile again associated with deteriorated chest CT, as discussed above (Patient 2 in Table 5 ). However, the clinical characteristics of Patient 2 was not in line with other 7 patients, who retested with positive SARS-CoV-2 but were only associated with mild symptoms as dry cough or intermittent fever and ultimately pronounced negative tests and improved chest CT during 4 weeks of follow-up period. Above information suggests that, positive SARS-CoV-2 test after discharge may not refer to the deterioration of patient's condition. But to evaluate patients whether reinfected with COVID-19, more observation and laboratory or radiological examination are in need. Yet, sufficient care and quarantine must be taken for such patients, since it possibly implies that they can still be contagious. There were a couple of factors possibly accounting for the results of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid test. In one aspect, locations of sampling may play a major role as reported that higher viral loads are more easily to be detected in the nose than in the throat [10] . In another aspect, comprehensive factors such as technical variation of specimen collection, manipulation, as well as the sensitivity of detection kit might have negative impact on the result of nuclei acid assay [11] . As a matter of fact, positive patients after discharge in our study were barely symptomatic, suggesting that COVID-19 patient may shed variation of viral load resembling that of asymptomatic viral carriers with influenza [12] . SARS-CoV-2 may be long-standing in confirmed patients, with the viral pathogenicity depending on the immuno-status of the host, the severity of lesions, response to the therapeutic interventions and recovery course [13] [14] [15] . Thus, conclusion of recurrence of COVID-19 with reappearing of positive SARS-CoV-2 test alone shall be very carefully drawn. We also investigated the distribution of post-hospital quarantine locations and contact history to further explore the contagious potentiality of discharged COVID-19 patients. 87.02% of patients were home self-quarantined during the first two weeks, of which more than half (51.91%) of them were living with family, with the close contact persons of 111 in total ( Table 4) . As time lapsed, more patients were living with family in the third and fourth week after discharge with closely contacted persons increased to 167. Fortunately no suspected or confirmed COVID-19 cases were reported among contacted persons at the endpoint of the study, although prolonged incubation period was discovered elsewhere [7] . What's more, 7 persons who had contact history with 2 positive SARS-CoV-2 patients (Patient 1 and 3) were free of COVID-19 during 2 weeks of observation period (Table 5 ). However, the transmissibility of discharged COVID-19 patients was still uncertain in the current study, since it was not completely evidenced for retested positive SARS-CoV-2 patients who were quarantined without contacting others in the observation time. More studies to isolate or culture SARS-CoV-2 from those patients may be required to fully address this issue. Our study has limitations. Firstly, real time RT-PCR assay detects 2 regions Data presented as n (n/N%), where N is the total patients in the respective column. a p value indicate differences between Non-severe and Severe groups.

144160,"To our knowledge, this is the first study that investigates the real-time progression of a group of individuals who were initially negative for SARS-CoV-2 on RT-PCR after exposure to an outbreak of COVID-19 on a cruise ship. Nine individuals later tested positive on RT-PCR from nasopharyngeal swab, had high-resolution CT changes, or showed seroconversion, and were thus found to be infected with SARS-CoV-2. Despite the positive clinical findings, six of the nine patients remained asymptomatic throughout the 14-day quarantine after leaving the ship (ratio of symptomatic to asymptomatic patients 1:2). If the cruise ship epidemic is a microcosm of the community outbreak scenario, then individuals with or without pneumonia could carry the virus for a long period but remain asymptomatic. 8, 9 Asymptomatic patients with few or no comorbidities could spread the disease, whereas symptomatic patients represent only a small, but visible, proportion of total cases. 15 This finding is particularly important in densely populated cities like Hong Kong, with an average living space of 4·6 m² per person, equivalent to half a parking space. 16 Viral shedding from asymptomatic individuals could be transmitting the virus to others, making it difficult to identify and isolate index patients by contact-tracing for early quarantine. Trans mission from asymptomatic individuals could explain in part the rapid increases in numbers of new cases in high-incidence countries such as the USA, Russia, the UK, Brazil, and European nations. 10 SARS-CoV-2 could be spreading via respiratory droplets or through direct and indirect contact via the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts. 17, 18 Considering that most outbreaks on cruise ships are of respiratory and gastrointestinal infections, the risk of infection and associated morbidity and mortality in passengers increases with longer duration of travel and colder weather. 19, 20 The period of exposure on the Diamond Princess cruise ship was 3 weeks, during which the passengers were unable to disembark, which is consistent with the high number of passengers (n=712) who contracted the infection. 12 The situation was likely to have been made worse by infected but asymptomatic crew members who continued to work unprotected, but who could have been shedding the virus. A recent modelling study 11 estimated that the initial basic reproduction number (R 0 ) of the outbreak on the Diamond Princess cruise ship was 14·8, before any infection control measures had been implemented and while the passengers were a completely naive group. The R 0 then decreased to 1·78 after the quarantine and transfer interventions were initiated (Feb 5-17, 2020). 11 This estimation of R 0 was lower than that of 2·2 (95% CI 1·4-3·9) that was suggested at the beginning of the outbreak in Wuhan, 21 although a higher R 0 of more than 3 has also been reported. 22 An R 0 of 2·2 for COVID-19 would be similar to that of SARS and influenza. 23 Nevertheless, evacuation of all passengers and crews early on in the outbreak would probably have prevented more infections, as suggested by the current findings. Because the screening test was done between early February and mid-February, before the air evacuation, we assumed that passengers could have acquired and been incubating the infection shortly before the test, and therefore tested negative, or they could have acquired the infection after the test. Based on this assumption, we screened 215 passengers by serial virological, serological, and radiological methods. Our findings show a dynamic clinical presentation of SARS-CoV-2. Of the three diagnostic methods we used, the immunoassay for IgG and nasopharyngeal swab RT-qPCR were the most sensitive. Throat swab RT-qPCR was less sensitive; 24 it identified only the two patients who consistently had the highest viral load in nasopharyngeal swab RT-qPCR and did not identify the other six patients identified by nasopharyngeal swab RT-qPCR. The apparent low sensitivity of throat swab RT-qPCR might also account for the negative screening test done on board the ship by the Japanese Health Ministry. The three patients who were febrile felt transiently unwell, with concomitant symptoms of malaise, unproductive cough, and rhinorrhoea. The higher baseline nasopharyngeal swab viral load in symptomatic than asymptomatic patients in this study could be explained by the difference in time and degree of exposure to the virus, and might not be related to the symptoms. 25 Nevertheless, the per sistent nasopharyngeal viral load in asymptomatic patients is a major concern for infection control. Rectal swabs were negative in all nine patients, which was expected because none of the patients presented with diarrhoea. 18 Important initial laboratory markers, including lymphocyte count, C-reactive protein, and lactate dehydrogenase, remained normal in these asym ptomatic patients. Seroconversion occurred in all nine patients and it was the only diagnostic marker that was positive for one patient in this cohort who had high-resolution CT changes characteristic of a recent SARS-CoV-2 infection. For those patients who might have acquired the infection earliest and only shortly before the screening test, they might have seroconverted with a high IgG titre and remained asymptomatic with a negative RT-qPCR, with high-resolution CT radiological evidence of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonitis with ground-glass changes. The immunological response could be explained by the lower respiratory tract infection consistent with pneumonia. Similar to influenza viral infection, patients with severe disease and pneumonia had the highest antibody response. 26 This finding could be related to the more severe viral infection resulting in a stronger induction of the host's adaptive immunity mediated by B and T cells. 27 Because SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV have 90% amino acid homology for nucleoprotein and 73% amino acid homology for RBD, serum from patients with SARS-CoV might cross-react with our SARS-CoV-2 immunoassay, as shown by another group. 28 However, the cross-reactivity between SARS-CoV-2 and other human coronaviruses is expected to be lower, because the amino acid homology with nucleoprotein is less than 50%. Based on our previous study, 14 the sensitivity of the serology assay was 94% for anti-nucleoprotein IgG, 88% for anti-nucleoprotein IgM, 100% for anti-RBD IgG, and 94% for anti-RBD IgM. As stated in the Methods, the cutoff was based on a pre-pandemic general population cohort of 93 individuals without SARS-CoV-2 infection. Therefore, we expected that 1% would be outliers. 14 The clinical presentation of the nine patients in this cohort ranged from mild to severe. Among the mild cases, patients could remain asymptomatic (patients 3, 4, and 5) or symptomatic (patient 8), with no lower respiratory tract involvement, as suggested by normal chest radiograph and high-resolution CT. Their antinucleoprotein and anti-RBD IgG levels were low. Patients with moderate infection had lower respiratory tract involvement, as suggested by the ground glass changes on high-resolution CT. Nevertheless, they could still remain asymptomatic (patients 1, 2, and 6) or become symptomatic (patient 7). These patients had higher antinucleoprotein and anti-RBD IgG than patients with mild disease. Patient 9, who acquired the infection more recently, developed symptoms upon hospitalisation. The infection was more severe, involving the lower respiratory tract, with ground glass changes on high-resolution CT. Seroconversion took place during the observation period, with anti-nucleoprotein and anti-RBD IgG still increasing at the end of the observation period. Overall, anti-RBD IgG was the most sensitive serology marker, although the anti-nucleoprotein IgG response was stronger. The difference in anti-RBD IgG and antinucleoprotein IgG could be related to the severity of the viral infection, in which anti-RBD IgG was positive even in patients with upper respiratory tract infection, but at low OD values. Indeed, serology provides a feasible strategy to track SARS-CoV-2 infections. 29 We also investigated changes in IgM/IgG ratio for anti-nucleoprotein and anti-RBD and did not identify any trends that might reflect the timing of infection. Similar to findings from one of the largest case series from China, 8 high-resolution CT provided a reasonable diagnostic tool, especially in asymptomatic patients. In this cohort, it was able to detect lung ground-glass opacities in five of nine patients, including the three patients with asymptomatic lung infection. Similar to other studies, right-side changes were more common. 30 Individuals with more severe radiological changes tended to have higher nasopharyngeal viral load. High-resolution CT could also detect an RT-qPCR-negative asymptomatic patient (patient 1) who had high IgG and IgM titres, suggestive of a recent infection. Nevertheless, individuals who develop only an upper respiratory tract infection could still have a normal high-resolution CT. Chest radiograph detected radiological changes in only four patients. This study has several limitations. We did not have access to the data of patients who were hospitalised in Japan. We also did not have the cabin number and location of the participants when they were on board the ship, which could have provided some insight into how the infection was transmitted. Ten passengers did not give consent to participate in the study, and therefore we did not have their virological or serological data. Lastly, the study period was limited by the quarantine period and we could not follow up the participants beyond 14 days. The participants could have become RT-PCRpositive or antibody-positive after the quarantine period. The cruise ship setting provided an unusual opportunity to study the viral shedding and seroconversion of SARS-CoV-2, mimicking the start of a community outbreak. Passengers who are exposed to the virus might seroconvert while remaining asymptomatic with a high viral load, and they could continue to shed the virus. Highresolution CT also helped to establish a clinical diagnosis and to detect cases of asymptomatic lung infection. A combination of RT-qPCR and serology should be done to screen for community outbreaks and effectively perform contact tracing.  ","To our knowledge, this is the first study that investigates the real-time progression of a group of individuals who were initially negative for SARS-CoV-2 on RT-PCR after exposure to an outbreak of COVID-19 on a cruise ship.<q>Despite the positive clinical findings, six of the nine patients remained asymptomatic throughout the 14-day quarantine after leaving the ship (ratio of symptomatic to asymptomatic patients 1:2).<q>Nine individuals later tested positive on RT-PCR from nasopharyngeal swab, had high-resolution CT changes, or showed seroconversion, and were thus found to be infected with SARS-CoV-2.

In challenge with this pandemic quarantine technique has been used widely after tens of years. In the course of the pandemic, many countries evacuated their citizens from affected regions and combined the evacuation with quarantine process. Some examples of these countries who evacuated their citizens are Germany, Italy, Spain, and USA. In further times, during the course of pandemic, according to spread, other countries evacuated their citizens from these countries too. Despite being the origin of the pandemic, in later times Wuhan was also a place where people were evacuated to. Evacuation and quarantine have caused social and psychological impacts on people and some of them took place in mainstream media. In this review article, evacuation and quarantine processes as well as the society’s reactions to these, have been compiled.","Beginning from China on December 2019, COVID-19 epidemic has spreaded all over the world in a short period of time and has been a pandemic.<q>In challenge with this pandemic quarantine technique has been used widely after tens of years.<q>In the course of the pandemic, many countries evacuated their citizens from affected regions and combined the evacuation with quarantine process.

144970,"Epidemics and pandemics are a periodic phenomenon. People in the community face several challenges during such periods. Lack of awareness often leads to an unconcerned attitude, which may adversely affect the preparedness to meet these challenges. Impacts of these epidemics and pandemics are often intense, which may adversely affect the mental well-being of a given population. The fear and anxiety related to epidemics and pandemics also influence the behavior of people in the community. Hence, this study attempted to evaluate the awareness, attitude, anxiety and perceived mental healthcare needs in the society. Rubin et al. (2009) had conducted a similar study during the swine flu outbreak in the United Kingdom (Rubin et al., 2009) . They had conducted the survey telephonically over four days in the native population who heard the term ""swine flu"" and was able to speak English. There is much similarity like illness between swine flu and COVID-19 infection. Both illnesses are viral in origin involving the respiratory system and spreading by droplet infection. Similar precautions are often recommended for the prevention of swine flu and COVID-19 infection. Unfortunately, there is no specific treatment or vaccine available for COVID-19 infection, whereas both treatment and vaccines are present for swine flu. All epidemics and pandemics have their unique characteristics in terms of causality, progression and control measures. It is crucial to provide health education and create awareness during such situations for effective prevention of disease spread (Johnson and Hariharan, 2017) . It has been seen in a previous study that health professionals often have better awareness, positive attitudes towards epidemics/ pandemics and they often experience low levels of anxiety (Mishra et al., 2016) . But, a study from Ethiopia reported, poor knowledge and erroneous believes of healthcare professionals, during the Ebola virus outbreak in 2015 and it urged for intense training of the healthcare professionals (Abebe et al., 2016) . In a study conducted in Trinidad and Tobago in 2016, following the H1N1 epidemic, it was seen that a significant proportion of the general public was unaware of the seriousness and measures of prevention of the epidemic (Johnson and Hariharan, 2017) . A similar study, evaluating the knowledge, attitude, and perception of Ebola virus infection among secondary school children of Nigeria, found that most of the participants had inadequate knowledge and carried a negative attitude towards the outbreak (Ilesanmi and Alele, 2016) . Most of the participants in our study were educated -either graduate or post-graduate and (%) were healthcare professionals. The participants had a moderate level of awareness regarding the mode of spread, symptoms, and yet adequate awareness about the preventive measures. It was possibly due to the government and media emphasizing more on the preventive measures. Educated and especially healthcare people get more sensitized by these information's. The study participants reported frequent use of sanitizers, hand wash, and masks during the past one week. This indicates the increasing concern of participants towards personal hygienic measures to avoid COVID-19 infection. Sensitization and awareness about COVID-19 are reflected in their behavior and attitude significantly as most of the participants (more than 4/5th) agreed withsocial distancing, avoiding travel, self-quarantine and adequate hygienic measures. However, their fear, apprehension and possibly stigma is reflected when they were asked about the inclusion of recovered COVID-19 patients to the mainstream of society. Stigma is associated with many such health conditions. Adequate awareness may minimize the stigma and facilitate acceptance in the general population. When anxiety affects a larger population, it may result in panic buying, leading to exhaustion of resources. It also can lead to limitations in daily activities, avoidance behavior causing limited socialization, self-medication. Because of anxiety, people adopt various unwanted lifestyle and dietary modifications under the influence of rumors. These may affect mental health adversely. Hence, it is important to deal with the mental health difficulties in situations of the pandemic. Similarly, additional changes likeisolation, social distancing, self-quarantine, restriction of travel and the ever-spreading rumors in social media are also likely to affect mental health adversely (Banerjee, 2020) . In our study, we found approximately 28 % of people reporting sleep difficulties. More than two-thirds of participants reported themselves worried after seeing posts about COVID-19 pandemic in various social media platforms and approximately 46 % of participants reported their worries related to the discussion of COVID-19 pandemic in news channels and print media. This indicates that a significant proportion of participants in the survey, despite having adequate awareness about coronavirus infection, are largely influenced by media information. Media influences the mental well-being and add to the level of anxiety. The swine flu pandemic of 2009-2010, which resulted in high mortality worldwide also caught global media attention and evoked anxiety among the public significantly (Everts, 2013) . Approximately, one-third of participants had the urge to buy and stock things at home during the past week. Panic buying is often seen during pandemics/epidemics, which leads to the exhaustion of resources. Media reporting about the shortage of resources and essential things of daily living further increases the panic buying. Sensible media reporting during such a crisis may be beneficial in tackling mental health challenges. In our study, frequent inappropriate behaviors (anger, restlessness, worry) and pre-occupation about COVID-19 infection leading to posting on social media, was seen in 1/6th and 1/3rd of the participants respectively. Similarly, two-thirds of the participants felt the need to talk about their worries related to COVID-19 pandemic with someone. The opportunities to vent out their distress was limited in most places due to the lockdown state. At the same time, the electronic and print media, as well as social media, are constantly discussing the pandemic status. As a result, people are not able to cope with and feeling emotionally exhausted. More than three fourth of the participants felt the need for help for their mental well-being. Our study population was not infected with COVID-19 infection, still, there was an increased need for mental healthcare. Those individuals, who are infected with COVID-19 infection or suspected of having the infection and the health workers, who are dealing with COVID-19 infected patients are expected to have more compromised mental health and higher perceived mental healthcare needs. Meeting the individual mental health needs in typical clinical settings that need face-to-face interviews for evaluation, is challenging in the current scenario considering the risk of the spread of COVID-19 infection. In this situation considering online mental health consultation might be more beneficial and it can deliver the consultation at the doorstep (Yao et al., 2020) . During this coronavirus pandemic, most of the educated people and health professionals are aware of this infection, possible preventive measures, the importance of social distancing and government initiatives were taken to limit the spread of infection. However, there are increased worries and apprehensions among the public regarding acquiring the COVID-19 infection. People have higher perceived needs to deal with their mental health difficulties. There is a need to intensify the awareness program and address the mental health issues of people during this COVID-19 pandemic. There is no study to date that evaluated the mental health perspectives of people during the COVID-19 pandemic. It is important to study the mental health impacts in various populations (general populations, cases of COVID-19, close contacts of COVID-19 and healthcare workers) for planning effective intervention strategies for them.

Elderly people and people with underlying diseases have a higher risk of severe courses with mandatory ventilation. So far there are neither effective drugs nor vaccinations available, so only public health interventions such as physical distancing and hygiene measures on the one hand and targeted testing followed by isolation and quarantine measures on the other hand are available. China has shown that maximum use of these measures can control the epidemic.

Stigma and blame targeted at communities affected by the outbreak may hinder international trade, finance and relationships, instigating further unrest. Due care needs to be taken to erase the stigma associated with disease, racism, religious propaganda and psychosocial impact and needs to be implemented by regular discussion with trained and specialist health care personnel by making task force and execution teams who are directly engaged in health care delivery systems without creating any communication gaps between policy makers and ground level workers.

146584,"Our case helps offer insight into the clinical course of COVID-19 patients. Coronavirus disease is thought to be transmitted from person to person by respiratory droplets and direct contact [6] . Despite working as an outpatient nurse, it is less likely that she contracted COVID-19 at the workplace as symptom onset was 3 weeks after her last known patient contact. The incubation period of COVID-19 is estimated to be between 2 and 14 days [7] [8] [9] . Alternatively, she may have been exposed during her self-imposed home isolation in Wuhan, however her apparent contacts, including her husband and grandson, were asymptomatic. Her grandson later tested negative for COVID-19. There is a likelihood that she was infected during transit to the quarantine facility at either the Wuhan International Airport or on her flight to the United States. Exposure at the quarantine facility seems less likely as that would reflect an incubation period of only a day. Similar to the first documented cohort of COVID-19 patients linked to the Huanan seafood market, our patient had leukopenia and thrombocytopenia, both of which recovered during the course of her illness [2] . She notably developed lymphopenia on hospital day 6, which also recovered. The rise in liver enzymes was more likely related to the disease course of COVID-19 than to druginduced liver injury from remdesivir, as enzyme levels down trended to normal during daily antiviral infusions. No other clear implicating medications causing liver injury were utilized. Relative hypoxemia was noted by oxygen saturation, however, our patient never required supplemental oxygen. Chest imaging findings were also significant for infiltrates. In contrast to the reported cohort, [2] renal function in this patient remained normal during the disease course. The clinical improvement in our patient coincided with the initiation of remdesivir on day 6 of hospitalization. However, it is unclear if this improvement can be attributed to the drug and/or to the natural course of COVID-19 infection. Ongoing investigational trials will help establish the efficacy of remdesivir and other antivirals in COVID-19 management [10] [11] [12] . CDC-guided NP and OP samples of our patient from hospital day 1 onward all tested negative for COVID-19 (Table 1) . Although our patient was clinically ill enough to warrant continued hospitalization and initiation of the antiviral remdesivir; she would have met laboratory criteria to clear isolation precautions by hospital day 3 with two negative NP and OP specimens on two separate days. During hospital days 1-7, her high fevers and infectious signs in the setting of NP and OP negativity question whether our patient was infective at the time or whether these were manifestations of a prolonged, excessive cytokine and chemokine response that has been documented in other highly pathogenic coronaviruses including SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV [13] . Our patient's positive sputum RT-PCR result for COVID-19 likely represented inactive viral shedding in the lower respiratory tract rather than active contagious virus, given she had dramatic clinical improvement by hospital day 11. In the 2003 SARS-CoV outbreak, viral shedding was detected in the respiratory, gastrointestinal, and urinary tracts for many weeks after onset of illness, while active transmission of infection was not Day 0 correlates with day of illness onset (tests done at quarantine facility), day 1 is initial day of hospitalization noted after 2 weeks [14] . The pragmatic correlation of SARS-CoV-2 detection by RT-PCR in sputum, NP, and OP samples with infectivity is warranted to explore similar trends for COVID-19. Further research aimed at the understanding of transmission dynamics will help to guide screening practices and support clearance of infectivity. Our experience with one of the earliest cases of COVID-19 in the United States offers insight into the pertinent clinical and laboratory findings of this novel disease entity. Use of remdesivir without any overt side effects in our patient, supports the ongoing clinical trials as a candidate therapeutic agent in COVID-19. In addition, the case highlights possible areas for improvement in diagnosing coronavirus disease and robust protocols in establishing clearance of infection to facilitate removal of isolation precautions and safe return of patients to the community. These topics are pertinent for controlling disease spread and promoting public safety.

148012,"BACKGROUND: An ongoing outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has spread around the world. It is debatable whether asymptomatic COVID-19 virus carriers are contagious. We report here a case of the asymptomatic patient and present clinical characteristics of 455 contacts, which aims to study the infectivity of asymptomatic carriers. MATERIAL AND METHODS: 455 contacts who were exposed to the asymptomatic COVID-19 virus carrier became the subjects of our research. They were divided into three groups: 35 patients, 196 family members and 224 hospital staffs. We extracted their epidemiological information, clinical records, auxiliary examination results and therapeutic schedules. RESULTS: The median contact time for patients was four days and that for family members was five days. Cardiovascular disease accounted for 25% among original diseases of patients. Apart from hospital staffs, both patients and family members were isolated medically. During the quarantine, seven patients plus one family member appeared new respiratory symptoms, where fever was the most common one. The blood counts in most contacts were within a normal range. All CT images showed no sign of COVID-19 infection. No severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections was detected in 455 contacts by nucleic acid test. CONCLUSION: In summary, all the 455 contacts were excluded from SARS-CoV-2 infection and we conclude that the infectivity of some asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 carriers might be weak.","BACKGROUND: An ongoing outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has spread around the world.<q>It is debatable whether asymptomatic COVID-19 virus carriers are contagious.<q>We report here a case of the asymptomatic patient and present clinical characteristics of 455 contacts, which aims to study the infectivity of asymptomatic carriers.

148029,"Abstract After the initial breakout of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic (now called COVID-19)—in Wuhan, China—and its subsequent fast dispersion throughout the world, many questions regarding its pathogenesis, genetic evolution, prevention, and transmission routes remain unanswered but fast explored. More than 100,000 confirmed, infected cases within a relatively short period of time globally corroborated the presumption that a pandemic will develop; such a pandemic will require a suite of global intervention measures. Consequently, different countries have reacted differently to the COVID-19 outbreak, but a uniform global response is necessary for tackling the pandemic. Managing the present or future COVID-19 outbreaks is not impossible but surely difficult. Barring the live-animal trade at the markets; revising the regulations and rules of customs, import or export across borders; supporting and expediting projects to develop vaccines and antiviral drugs; immediate quarantine of the involved regions; and also producing and supplying a large number of protective facemasks and preventing its stockpiling or smuggling are the main actions suggested to deal with the present or a forthcoming COVID-19 outbreak. Increasing numbers of infected cases had heightened concerns about the public health and welfare. Thus, preparing for the next probable pandemic of COVID-19 demands scrutinization of the lessons we have learnt so far.","Managing the present or future COVID-19 outbreaks is not impossible but surely difficult.<q>Consequently, different countries have reacted differently to the COVID-19 outbreak, but a uniform global response is necessary for tackling the pandemic.<q>Abstract After the initial breakout of the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic (now called COVID-19)—in Wuhan, China—and its subsequent fast dispersion throughout the world, many questions regarding its pathogenesis, genetic evolution, prevention, and transmission routes remain unanswered but fast explored.

Si bien, en nuestro país la presencia de casos graves esta iniciando, es importante tomarse en cuenta las manifestaciones hepáticas en la población general para poder reconocer los casos que potencialmente pudieran requerir hospitalización oportuna. Por otro lado, la infección por COVID en pacientes con EHC pre-existente implicará un mayor riesgo y probabilidad de disfunción hepática por lo que se recomienda que los profesionales de la salud a cargo de estos pacientes estén atentos al desarrollo de potenciales complicaciones. Si bien, se podrían cuestionar la utilidad de las estrategias propuestas en este documento, sin embargo, en una enfermedad emergente de la envergadura de la actual, sería imposible dar recomendaciones probadas al 100%.

From a maximum of 3.98 before the lockdown of Wuhan City, the values of Rt declined to below 1 by the second week of February, after construction of hospitals dedicated to COVID-19 patients. The Rt continued to decline following additional measures in line with the policy of “early detection, early report, early quarantine and early treatment”. The results provide quantitative evaluations of how intervention measures succeeded and their timings, from which lessons can be learnt by other countries and those dealing with future outbreaks.","Abstract Effective reproductive numbers (Rt) were calculated from data on the COVID-19 outbreak in China and linked to dates in 2020 when different interventions were enacted.<q>From a maximum of 3.<q>98 before the lockdown of Wuhan City, the values of Rt declined to below 1 by the second week of February, after construction of hospitals dedicated to COVID-19 patients.

149050,"Within the context of a pandemic such as COVID-19, individuals' reactions to the pandemic to avoid infection could be predicted by a variety of variables. This study aimed to ascertain the main determinants of social distancing adopted by Arab residents in Qatar to avoid infection with the pandemic disease COVID-19. Referring particularly to the association between personality traits and social distancing, the results showed that agreeableness was negatively associated with social distancing, which indicates that individuals who are more sociable and prefer to participate in social eventssuch as volunteering activities and social interactions-were less likely to practice social distancing to avoid infectious disease. Since altruism, empathy, and helping behavior are the main characteristics of agreeable individuals (Graziano et al. 2007) , they may prioritize social interactions and engage in social practices and feel less obligated to practice social distancing. O openness, C conscientiousness, E extraversion, A agreeableness, N neuroticism, RP risk perception, PHP personal hygiene practices, SD social distancing *p < .05; **p < .001 This behavior may increase their likelihood of being infected with COVID-19. Furthermore, conscientiousness and neuroticism were shown to be positively associated with adopting social distancing to avoid COVID-19 infection. This means that individuals who are more inclined to comply with social norms and those who develop anxious and fearful feelings tend to practice social distancing. In their study, Cowling et al. (2010) reported that high levels of anxiety were associated with lower rates of personal hygiene practices (handwashing) and higher levels of social distancing to avoid H1N1 contagion. Moreover, Trobst et al. (2002) found that individuals who score high on neuroticism tend to adopt risky sexual practices. The inconsistency in the behavior of people prone to neuroticism when dealing with a pandemic disease may be associated with their level of neuroticism. For example, individuals with high levels of fear and anxiety tend to adopt denial as a psychological defense mechanism to mitigate their fears; this means that they practice risky behaviors to feel psychologically secure (Aronson 2008; Florian and Mikulincer 1997; Peek et al. 2008) . In addition to the findings on personality traits, the results show that risk perception predicts social distancing. Hence, individuals who consider COVID-19 to be a serious danger are more inclined to adopt social distancing practices to avoid infection. These results corroborate those of previous studies (e.g., Brug et al. 2009; Ibuka et al. 2010; Walter et al. 2012) . Furthermore, when an individual perceives a health risk factor, they react to the risk by attempting to find ways to avoid it. These solutions represent avoidance behavior that is adopted to survive an infectious disease. Our results also show that women are more likely to practice social distancing than men; these results coincide with those of prior studies (e.g., Liao et al. 2010; Moran and Del Valle 2016; Park et al. 2010) . The participants who declared that they maintain good personal hygiene practices were shown to be more likely to adopt social distancing. This variable is the most powerful predictor of social distancing practices. Since keeping personal hygiene practices helps to reduce the risk of being infected (Aiello and Larson 2002) , it could be inferred that an individual's personal perception of being clean motivates them to reinforce such behavior by adopting further actions, such as social distancing. Moreover, Qatar is considered to be a multinational society (Mahgoub and Qawasmeh 2012) so that members of each group may perceive other groups as outgroups; therefore, individuals who adhere to good personal hygiene practices might perceive others as ""less clean"" or more contaminated, which, in turn, increases the probability of being infected (Speltini and Passini 2014) ; thus, they embrace more protective behavior, such as social distancing. The findings of this study provide a better understanding of individuals' responses to the pandemic based on personality traits and illustrate the importance of both risk perception and personal hygiene practices. During the pandemic, individuals' behavior could be predicted if we know information about their personality traits, so that health care providers can design appropriate interventions aimed at raising awareness among people in the community. Moreover, the present study assists in identifying the powerful role of personal hygiene practices that should be highlighted in national campaigns aimed at helping people in the community. Additionally, the association between risk perception and social distancing measures can be used to help reduce infection rates, which would help control the spread of the pandemic. Furthermore, based on the findings concerning gender differences in precautionary behaviors to avoid contagion (social distancing), our findings would be useful in encouraging media platforms to focus on presenting persuasive messages focused on men, as they are less likely to adopt protective behaviors. Our study has limitations. First, the respondents were residents of Qatar of different Arab nationalities; therefore, their precautionary behavior (social distancing) may be affected by the culture of their home country. Second, the sample may not be representative of all nationalities in Qatar, particularly individuals of non-Arab nationalities working in Qatar, such as Indians, Filipinos, and Pakistanis; therefore, caution should be used when generalizing the results. Third, the scale developed for this study to assess social distancing practices during COVID-19 in Qatar comprised three items that have acceptable reliability. However, it is necessary to develop and validate an extensive scale and re-examine the predictors of social distancing. Fourth, although self-reporting data can help in obtaining respondents' views and perspective, self-reported answers may be biased because of social desirability. The current study sheds light on factors that could predict the adoption of precautionary behaviors (social distancing) to avoid infection during the COVID-19 pandemic. The main predictors are personality traits, risk perception, and personal hygiene practices. We suggest further research on the role of the neuroticism personality trait in predicting social distancing behavior, as there have been inconsistent findings concerning how individuals who are high in neuroticism behave in response to the pandemic. Further research is also recommended to investigate the impact of personal hygiene practices on social distancing from an interpersonal contact perspective.

149303,"The very first observation of the incubation period of SARS-CoV-2 came from the National Health Such difference might be due to the difference in infectious dose since travelers to Hubei might be exposed to different sources of infection multiple times during their stay in Hubei. In contrast, patients with no travel history to Hubei were temporarily exposed to their infected relatives, friends or colleagues with mild or even no symptoms. It is possible that the incubation period of non-travelers was highly volatile, as suggested by the higher variance in the gamma model that provided slightly poorer fit. This could potentially pose a threat to the effectiveness of the existing preventive measures. The duration of quarantine period must be considered with caution. As a comparison, previous studies on the incubation period for SARS-CoV-2 are shown in Table 2 . The 95 th percentiles reported in previous studies varied between 10.3 and 13.3 days, consistent with the current practice of quarantine period of 2 weeks. However, the present study found that the 95 th percentile of non-travelers could be 14.6 days and up to 17.1 days under 95% level of confidence. Coupled with the high variability of the incubation period, it is suggested that the duration of the quarantine period of 3 weeks is deemed more suitable.

149488,"A total of 1101 Weibo posts pertinent to COVID-19 were identified. Table 1 shows the key word frequency in the published posts made by the random user samples in the study period. We found little evidence that Chinese netizens paid much attention to the outbreak before January 20 when the Chinese Government for the first time openly acknowledged that human-to-human transmission of the virus was happening and when China initiated nationwide reporting on the outbreak. 5, 6 Our data show that, following this date, attention to the outbreak quickly increased and has remained high over time. Particularly high levels of social media traffic also appeared around when Wuhan was first placed in quarantine (January 23-24, 8-9% of the overall posts), when a scandal associated with the Red Cross Society of China occurred (February 1, 8%), and, following the death of Dr Li Wenliang (February 6-7, 11%), 1 of the whistleblowers who was reprimanded by the Chinese police in early January for discussing this outbreak on WeChat groups. 7 See Technical Appendix for sample posts for each of these events. Low levels of attention to the outbreak among Chinese citizens in early January may represent a missed window of opportunity to contain the outbreak. Given that the adoption of personal protective behaviors has been shown to be associated with trust in government and that large-scale social distancing measures have been put in place in many parts of China, 8, 9 ensuring that citizens are aware of the true severity of the outbreak in its early stages is likely to increase acceptance and compliance with prevention and control measures. Governments worldwide should take note of lessons learned in China and should more proactively communicate early warnings to the public in a transparent manner.

149569,"We report the epidemic data of 85 households with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infected members in Wuhan City, showing a sec- ondary transmission rate of 30% among household members. The infection rate of close contacts was 38% for households with 1 contact, 50% for households with 2 contacts, and 31% for households with 3 contacts. Now SARS-CoV-2 is spreading around the world. As a simple and effective method, people in the epidemic areas were asked to stay at home and reduce outgoing. But unless all suspected patients and close contacts of confirmed infections were quarantined, transmission among household members will still be an import route of transmission, especially in the areas with more family members. Data about transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in household contacts is now limited. In the report of Zunyou Wu, 10 20 provinces outside of Hubei in China found 1183 case clusters, 64% of the clusters have been within familial households. In another research on SARS-CoV-2 infected cases in Zhejiang province, China, 21 of 62 patients (34%) were associated with familial clusters. And previous works on other two coronavirus caused pneumonia epidemics reported secondary transmission rate among household contacts of 5% for Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and 10.2% for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV). 11 , 12 Our work showed a secondary transmission rate of 30% among household contacts with SARS-CoV-2 infection in Wuhan city, which was similar with the data of Zhejiang province and much more severe than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV did. This is in accordance with the fact that SARS-CoV-2 has caused infected cases in ever greater quantities and is spreading in a much higher speed than MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV. [13] [14] [15] [16] Based on the imported cases from Wuhan into other cities, the basic reproductive number for SARS-CoV-2 was 2.68. The epidemic doubling time was estimated to be 6.4 days. 17 In this work, as there were only 3.0 ± 1.1 days between the onset of second infection and onset of third infection in households, we prefer to consider the second and third infections in households all as second-generation infections.

149583,"In this article, we introduce our model, the D 2 EA (Delay Differential Epidemic Analyser) to depict the epidemic picture of the ongoing COVID-19 pneumonia. The D 2 EA is revised from the SEIR model, with ample consideration into the quarantine measures and variation of practical factors. Through comparison and analysis, we see that the D 2 EA model depicts a com-prehensive picture of the ongoing epidemic, and thus its forecast is reliable. In our experiment part, we fit the D 2 EA to the collected data from official reports of the epidemic in Hubei Province, the source of the epidemic, using nonlinear optimization methods and conduct forecast of the epidemic. According to the D 2 EA's forecast, accumulated confirmed infected cases in Hubei will reach the peak at the end of February and then steady down. We also quantify that the currently adopted quarantine measures keep the epidemic 1/10 the scale it could have been, and recommend that Hubei Province, especially the city of Wuhan relieves the lockdown state no earlier than in late March.

149605,"Our analysis results strongly demonstrate that reducing secondary infections among close contacts would effectively limit human-to-human transmission, and public health measures, such as the rapid identification of cases, tracing and following up with people who had contact with an infected person, infection prevention and control in health care settings, and the implementation of health measures for travelers, can greatly prevent further spread of the disease. The documented COVID-19 reproduction numbers range from 2.0 to 4.9 (6, 11, 25) , which are based on cases that developed during different transmission phases and in different areas. For instance, the R 0 in Wuhan was obviously higher than that in other cities during the timeframe analyzed. Furthermore, after implementing the prevention measures employed by the Chinese government and local authorities, we regarded the inferred R 0 results of the four cities as reasonable and interpretable. In this study, we aimed to monitor COVID-19 trends after cases were imported into other cities and estimate the spread pattern by mathematical modeling, which can be helpful for evaluating the potential risk and severity of new outbreaks. The results of our study show that, for four metropolitan areas of China, the containment measures were an effective control at that time; however, it is imperative to raise awareness in the population and prevent potential outbreak risks going forward. The study has limitations. The present reported data are insufficient to understand the full epidemiological pattern of COVID-19 transmission and new potential outbreaks. For example, the estimates in this manuscript have a certain degree of uncertainty and delays due to the limitations in reporting mechanisms over the course of the natural history of the cases, the impact of other potential asymptomatic cases, and some unreported cases. Some studies were conducted with the assumption that a small fraction, 20%, were not reported (7) and others reported the estimated asymptomatic proportion was 17.9% (26) or 60% (21) . Evidently, such asymptomatic infectious cases are not fully reported by current testing method. However, some studies suggested crowdsourced data could be FIGURE 6 | Infected population curve with different quarantined proportion of exposed individuals for four cities. compiled and analyzed as an complementation of officially released data, which could perhaps help in improving the analysis results (27) (28) (29) . As concluded from the WHO-China Joint Mission report (30), the COVID-19 transmission dynamics are inherently contextual, as are the dynamics for any outbreak, and people worldwide need to work together to defend against this disease. To do this, it is necessary to: (1) enhance the understanding of the evolving COVID-19 and the nature and the impact of ongoing containment measures; (2) share knowledge on the COVID-19 response and preparedness measures being implemented in countries affected by or at risk of importations of COVID-19; (3) generate recommendations for adjusting COVID-19 containment and response measures in China and internationally; and (4) establish priorities for a collaborative program of work, research, and development to address critical gaps in knowledge, responses, readiness tools, and strategies. As a consequence of our study, we concluded that the outbreak could be greatly reduced by strict public health interventions. The public intervention strategies and implemented protection measures conducted in these four areas may help provide epidemiological suggestions to governments that guide measures for the international cases that are rapidly emerging. ","Our analysis results strongly demonstrate that reducing secondary infections among close contacts would effectively limit human-to-human transmission, and public health measures, such as the rapid identification of cases, tracing and following up with people who had contact with an infected person, infection prevention and control in health care settings, and the implementation of health measures for travelers, can greatly prevent further spread of the disease.<q>The documented COVID-19 reproduction numbers range from 2.<q>The study has limitations.

149651,"The modeling strategy using parameter perturbation and ensemble simulation facilitates the understanding of strong random network epidemic models by quantifying their uncertainty. Uncertainty ranges imply the potential ceiling (the worst outcome) and floor (the best outcome) for the spread of the disease. Simulations are acceptable if the reference observation falls in the uncertainty ranges (for example, The transmission dynamics of COVID-19 on the Diamond Princess are studied. However, the designed scenarios are simplified because COVID-19 can still transmit via air in stage 1 and 2a. We only consider the major driver because introducing extra transmission makes the simulations more complex, and provides limited knowledge. A major uncertainty comes from the data, i.e., except for the population and total infected individuals, the available data are mainly deduced from direct or indirect information. Assume that the indirect data has limited reliabilities, considerable errors are consequently introduced into simulations. A promising method for eliminating this type of uncertainty is formulating inference processes and mapping indirect information into epidemic modeling, i.e., using data assimilation [38] [39] [40] [41] . Quarantine is productive since dramatically drops from 6.94 for unprotected The other containment efforts are for the intensive social contact scenario. Considering the unprotected and protected contact tests, both and decrease 0 when quarantine is implemented, which proves that personal protective materials such as coveralls, masks, and eye covers are useful for infection prevention. We further notice that in the unprotected contact test is much larger than 2.5, which was 0 provided by the WHO report. This implies that if the intensive unprotected contact pattern is maintained for a couple of days, the epidemic curve may climb dramatically. As shown in the protected contact test, falls far below 2.5.

150375,"Abstract The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has continued to progress since its discovery in December 2019. A cluster of patients with atypical pneumonia identified in Wuhan, China, served as the epicenter of this recent epidemic. This family of viruses is responsible for the common cold along with the infamous severe acute respiratory syndrome epidemic in 2002 and Middle East respiratory syndrome in 2012. The Southern China Wholesale Market reportedly has connections to the original 27 cases in Wuhan, China. The worldwide confirmed case total has eclipsed 1,450,000, with more than 83,000 deaths. Patient presentation ranges from mild respiratory illness to acute respiratory distress syndrome and subsequent death. Early epidemiologic studies of viral spread support the hypothesis that COVID-19 can remain latent with an extended and infectious incubation period. The U.S. government has issued level 3 precautions for most international travel, along with prohibiting entry to foreign nationals traveling from China, Iran, the United Kingdom, the Republic of Ireland, and the European Schengen area (e.g., France, Italy, Germany). Prevention remains the mainstay in treating and defeating the COVID-19 epidemic. Anyone infected or suspected of being infected should self-quarantine at home or admit themselves to a specified hospital with infrastructure to handle the situation. The combination of prevention and containment provides the best opportunity to stall the spread of COVID-19.","Abstract The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has continued to progress since its discovery in December 2019.<q>This family of viruses is responsible for the common cold along with the infamous severe acute respiratory syndrome epidemic in 2002 and Middle East respiratory syndrome in 2012.<q>A cluster of patients with atypical pneumonia identified in Wuhan, China, served as the epicenter of this recent epidemic.

150991,"The spread of fear, anxiety and even panic due to the COVID-19 pandemic can lead to a worsening of pre-existing psychiatric disorders (Yao et al. 2020) . Despite the 1-3% prevalence of OCD in the general population (Ruscio et al. 2010 ) and its peculiar clinical picture (fear of being infected and cleaning rituals), there are no empirical studies on symptom worsening during the quarantine amongst patients with OCD. This is the first report that evaluated the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on this clinical population. We explored the changes on OCD symptoms during the quarantine in a group of patients with OCD, and investigated the effects of contamination symptoms and remission state before the quarantine on OCD symptom change during the quarantine, controlling for variables related to the life in quarantine (i.e., using online social networking sites as a way to maintain social relations, living with a relative in the same house, the possibility of remote working/studying). Overall, an increase in obsession and compulsion severity after the beginning of the pandemic emerged. Contamination symptoms were associated with a more elevated worsening. Perhaps, the continuous catastrophic news on TV, radio and social media combined with hygiene tips could have been a stressful situation for this vulnerable group, particularly for those with pre-existing contamination symptoms (Gao et al. 2020) . We found that remission status on OCD symptoms before the quarantine was associated with more elevated OCD symptom worsening during the quarantine. Therefore, mental health professionals should provide the necessary support not just treating patients who still report symptoms, but even improving relapse prevention during the period of social restrictions that is supposed to last longer after the end of complete lockdown. We should recommend, for example, to limit the access to news, or to read them only through reliable sources, to spent time daily on pleasant or physical activities that can help to distract from intrusive thoughts and decrease the level of anxiety. Moreover, the lockdown and the limited access to mental health centers, could have discouraged patients in seeking help and delayed the interventions. One of the most plausible explanations of the results is the reduction of treatments delivered to OCD patients during the lockdown period. So, we should educate all patients to ask help from mental health professionals, and we should improve alternative strategies such as online consultations and digital psychiatry (Cosic et al. 2020) . Digital technologies may have the advantage of allowing both individual and group sessions, which were found to be effective for OCD (Pozza and Dèttore, 2017) . However, while the use of new technologies may be helpful during a lockdown period, the use of Internet to deliver therapies could cause a worsening of symptoms, especially if performed without appropriate guidelines, as recently reported (Király et al. 2020 ). Finally, we underline the importance of relapse prevention strategies which should be implemented, particularly at the end of cognitive-behavioral therapy (Sookman and Steketee, 2010) , since they can contribute to reduce the risk of relapse, which is generally quite high amongst patients with OCD irrespective of the pandemic. Some limitations and future directions should be acknowledged. A relevant issue regards the small sample size and the low statistical power that prevented us from exploring the role of additional variables. Indeed, the study did not assess the effects of other symptoms often observed on symptom worsening amongst OCD patients such as anxiety and depression, or personality comorbidity Pozza et al. 2013) . The lack of a non-clinical control group without OCD or even another psychiatric group did not allow us to establish whether such a symptom worsening was specific to patients with OCD. In addition, the unavoidable lack of a control group of patients unexposed to the quarantine did not allow us to distinguish the effects of the quarantine from other potential sources of bias such as the lack of psychiatric visits during the quarantine, the inadequacy of the living physical space, or financial concerns caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. A future area of investigation regards the assessment of reassurance seeking through medical information on the Internet. It might also be interesting to explore other variables potentially related to symptom worsening such as the level of family accommodation during the quarantine. Another interesting point may be the assessment of inflated responsibility beliefs as a moderator between contamination symptoms and symptom worsening, since they have been found to be cognitive/maintenance vulnerability factors specific to OCD (Pozza and Dèttore, 2014) . It may be hypothesized that individuals with OCD who have inflated responsibility beliefs and elevated contamination obsessions do worsen during the quarantine at home, while those who have only contamination symptoms without the fear of potentially contaminating others do not. In conclusion, our preliminary report is the first work which assessed symptom worsening in OCD patients during the quarantine. Our findings suggest that this stressful period is associated with a significant symptom worsening, particularly amongst the patients with contamination symptoms and a remission state before the quarantine.

151059,"We conducted a case study with six Chinese families and learned about their lockdown experiences. Specifically, we investigated the information behaviors exhibited by elderly, young and middleaged individuals and children during the lockdown. Our findings reveal their information resource orchestration practices (information resourcing activities and behavioral adaptation activities) and their orchestrating mechanisms. The mechanisms included online emergence and convergence in community resilience, the overcoming of information flow impediments, and the application of absorptive capacity. The COVID-19 pandemic is an unprecedented global pandemic. More than two million people from 209 countries, areas, and territories have been infected with the virus. Billions of people, although safe, have been impacted significantly in all aspects of life. The lockdown strategies that have been utilized by governments force residents to stay at home and rely on living life virtually. The way people conduct their daily lives changes overnight, and people must adapt to their new lifestyles. Through the investigation of six Chinese families under lockdown, the study illuminates their information resourcing activities, information behavior adaptation activities, and three supporting mechanisms. As a response to the call to study information behavior during a global health crisis and lockdowns (Xie, et al., 2020) , this study contributes to the development of information behavior theory by elucidating individual information resource orchestration practices and mechanisms during a health emergency. Future research could compare different information behaviors in different countries during a global health crisis. Declarations of interest: none.

152039,"Medical outcomes included cumulative incidence, cumulative mortality, and number of ICU beds needed. To our knowledge, this is the first study to propose an agent-based microsimulation model of the epidemic of COVID-19 in France to predict the potential impact of post-quarantine measures, including social distancing, mask-wearing, and shielding of the population the most vulnerable to severe COVID-19 infection on the disease's cumulative incidence, mortality, and on ICU-bed occupancy. The model calibrated well and the variation of each model parameter value by ±20% had limited impact on outcome estimates, suggesting the robustness of our results. While quarantine is a highly effective means of containing viral spread, it would be unlikely to prevent a rebound of the epidemic and the need for a second lockdown once lifted, regardless of its duration. Social distancing and mask-wearing, when implemented in association, would be very effective in slowing down the epidemic and in reducing   ()   . . 30.20086264  mortality, but would be ineffective to ultimately prevent an overwhelming of ICU bed capacity. However, these measures when coupled with shielding of people the most vulnerable to severe SARS-CoV-2 infection, would be associated with better outcomes than these measures without shielding, including a lower cumulative incidence, mortality and number of ICU beds needed, sufficiently to prevent an overwhelming of ICU bed capacity and a second lockdown. Benefits would nonetheless be substantially reduced if these measures were not applied by most people or not maintained for a sufficiently long period, as herd immunity progressively establishes in the less vulnerable population. Our findings reinforce that SARS-CoV-2 infection represents a major public health threat in France. This disease may cause a very high number of deaths, estimated by our model at more than 300,000 deaths in France alone if no quarantine had been ordered and if ICUs had been overwhelmed. It further predicts more than 200,000 deaths if no specific mitigation measures are planned at the time of quarantine lifting. In line with prior work 5-7 , our findings suggest that quarantine, while a highly effective strategy to reduce the strain on healthcare systems by delaying the epidemic peak, is unlikely, if applied as a standalone strategy, to prevent the rebound of the epidemic and the need of a second lockdown. In line with this prediction, we found that combining post-quarantine social distancing and mask-wearing, while quite effective in reducing mortality by decreasing ICU-bed saturation and the R 0 of the COVID, would be ineffective in ultimately preventing ICU bed capacity from becoming overwhelmed and a subsequent second lockdown. By contrast, we found that coupling these measures with shielding people the most vulnerable to severe SARS-CoV-2 infection would be associated with better outcomes than only implementing social distancing and wearing of masks. These improved outcomes include a lower mortality and number of ICU beds needed, in a sufficient magnitude to prevent overwhelming ICU bed capacity and a second lockdown. Specifically, mortality would be   ()   Shielding vulnerable individuals implied in our simulation that these individuals always stayed home, except for grocery shopping, could stay with family members living in their home but with protection measures (i.e., social distancing and masks), did not attend any gatherings of friends and family members living outside their home, and strictly avoided contact with people presenting symptoms of COVID-19. Because prolonged quarantine exposes to increased risk of psychological and medical complications, 1 we consider that this less stringent strategy, while ensuring an adequate protection of this vulnerable population whose proportion is estimated at more than 3 of 10 people in France, would have better chance of being applied by most individuals. However, it is crucial to provide clear rationale and information for these measures, appeal to altruism by reminding people of the benefits to wider society, and ensure sufficient supplies and adequate healthcare access are provided. Our results could be explained by the herd immunity effect. It corresponds to the reduction of infection rates as a result of the indirect protection observed in the unimmunized segment of the population in which a large proportion has been infected and therefore immunized. 4 This is reflected by the predicted flattening of the cumulative incidence below 70% of the population with this strategy. Indeed, by slowing down to a far greater extent the viral spread in the vulnerable population than in the healthiest population, most of infected people would likely be individuals who are at lower risk to developing severe or critical symptoms 5 and being adequately treated since ICU capacity is not expected to be   ()   . . 30.20086264  overwhelmed, even during the peak incidence. Once a majority of the low-risk population have been immunized against COVID-19, the herd immunity effect would be likely to prevent vulnerable people from becoming infected. Because protection measures would be used by the whole population to flatten the epidemic rebound, however, the herd immunity effect, possibly associated with the progressive extinction of the epidemic, would be reached only at 38 weeks after the quarantine lifting, i.e., the end of February, 2021. Our study has several limitations. First, the model was calibrated on the diagnosis and mortality rates available from Santé Publique France 19 and Institut Pasteur. 24 However, we cannot exclude the possibility that these parameters are biased, as asymptomatic undiagnosed patients are likely responsible for a large hidden epidemic. Nevertheless, the observed differences across scenarios remained unchanged when considering a much higher and unlikely 8-10 diagnosis rate of 1 in 10, supporting the robustness of our conclusions. Second, the contact matrix was approximated using multiple assumptions for each type of contact. However, we found that the model calibrated well, suggesting that it might adequately predict the course of the COVID-19 epidemic in France. Third, following standard assumptions, we considered that infected people could develop immunity for at least several months. However, post-COVID-19 immunity length remains unknown. Fifth, the impact of many of mitigation measures depends on how people react and adhere to them, which is likely to vary across segments of the populations. Finally, as with any simulation model, the results should be interpreted as estimates. SARS-CoV-2 represents a major public health threat in France and worldwide. Postquarantine social distancing and wearing of masks for the whole population, coupled with shielding of vulnerable people would substantially lower mortality and prevent a second lockdown.

152310,"Australian quarantine policies are irremovable from its self-perception as nation, its view of non-citizen ‗others', its international trading prerogatives, and its reaction to human health pandemics. This paper created a framework for early analysis of quarantine policy responses. Analysis was enhanced through a historical institutionalism approach that identified moments of institutional isomorphism and punctuated equilibrium across 120 years of Australian quarantine policy history. By combining historical institutionalism with public administration concepts while carefully ensuring that typical pitfalls are minimized (Raadschelders 2011 , Radaelli et al. 2012 , this study showcases the potential of institutionalist and policy-administrative approaches for pandemic analyses. This paper showed that while Commonwealth and State/Territory contestation remains, significant sub-national action is occurring in cooperation with the Commonwealth. This is confirmed by a 2020 COVID-19 Plan and the rapid formation of a National Cabinet where the Commonwealth role is largely to communicate, to coordinate, to apportion and provide services where necessary, and to evaluate. Quarantine policy placement in Commonwealth hands in Australia's first twenty years remains in place at Australia's international borders even as the Commonwealth ceded domestic borders and other human health quarantine measures to States/Territories. Where mixed messaging occurs (thermal scanners, cruise ships, and schools), This article is protected by copyright.  Accepted Article the reasons include poor communication on the government's integration of science into screening (thermal scanners), and unclear lines of responsibility between states and the Commonwealth (cruise ships). Bickering about school re-openings between levels of government highlight historical disagreements about Commonwealth influence over State/Territory schooling. Potentially new COVID-19 related empirical research on border closures (e.g. Costantino et al. 2020 , Adekunle et al. 2020 , Liebig et al. 2020 ) and social distancing (e.g. Williem et al. 2020 , Neufeld and Khataee 2020 , Milne and Xie 2020 , Chang et al. 2020 ) are under review. Ongoing policy actions within Australia's COVID-19 response and its post-COVID action plans will be enhanced as policy learning and epidemiological learning accelerates. Overall, we find that Australia's quarantine policy history and pandemic responses have been largely reactive. This includes its Spanish flu responses, the 1999 Influenza Plan creation after H5N1 in 1997, and the 2008 creation of the AHMPPI after 2004 H5N1. In contrast, the current Australian COVID-19 quarantine policy responses are being proactively modified mid-pandemic. This has led to instances where AHMPPI plans are not followed or are extended beyond previously planned policy responses. Australia's capacity to competently navigate policy shifts mid-pandemic given COVID-19's clinical severity, its national coordination and collaboration with sub-national actors, and its reliance on evidence-based science and medical analysis are potential exemplar behaviors for other countries. Australia's pandemic responses and its history of tight biosecurity have institutionalized quarantine policies into Australian identities.

153157,"This study was the first to evaluate the posttraumatic stress, depressive reactions and psychological consequences in college students approximately one month after the COVID-19 outbreak in China and identify the related risk factors. While probable one-month PTSD prevalence was found to be only 2.7% of a large Chinese college student sample, probable depression was found to be as high as 9%. Students who felt extremely scared during the outbreak, those living in the worst-hit areas, and graduating/final year students were found to have the highest risk of developing PTSD and/or depression. Shorter sleep durations were also found to be significantly associated with mental health consequences; however, longer home-quarantine was not found to be associated with PTSD or depression. As about 89.7% percent of the students in this study were isolated at home, this study basically examined the PTSD and depression prevalence in college students isolated at home because of the COVID-19 outbreak. Almost everyone in the sample had been exposed to unceasingly stressful social media information about the new coronavirus. Faced with the lack of communication clarity common in initial disease outbreak periods, these reports tended to be full of rumors and uncertainty, which possibly amplified people's psychological distress (Johal, 2009; Ma, 2008) . Many people therefore believed that this unknown new virus was highly contagious (Xu et al., 2020) and had many unknown transmission routes that could cause death or disability. They also believed that if they caught it, they would not receive good treatment and would infect their families. Because they could do little to change the external situation, in addition to fear and worry, many experienced feelings of helplessness (Zheng et al., 2005) , which could partly explain the prominent rate of depression in the sample. Another explanation could be that as the social isolation reduced interpersonal communication, people's feelings of loneliness increased, which resulted in depressive symptoms (Ge et al., 2017; Weiss, 1973) . However, the PTSD (2.7%) and depression (9%) rates were much lower than a sample of 129 quarantined Canadian persons during the SARS epidemic (Hawryluck et al., 2004) , who had PTSD and depression rates of 28.9% and 31.2%. In that study, longer quarantine durations were found to be associated with increased PTSD symptom prevalence, which was inconsistent with our results. These differences may have been because the Canadian participants had different levels of contact with the diagnosed patients, which may have increased their contamination fears. The depression prevalence in this study was comparable with the 8.8% estimate found in a general population of 959 Chinese college students using the same screening scale (Zhang et al., 2013) . The depression rate, however, was slightly lower than the 11.8% found in an earlier study on Chinese college students based on the BDI scale (Yu et al., 2015) . Therefore, the depression rate in the college students during the pandemic was not particularly high, possibly because it had only been a month since the start of the pandemic. Because there have been limited similar studies in the past, it is difficult to directly compare the rates in this study. However, as the college students were found to have higher rates of depression than PTSD, it is recommended that university mental health professionals pay greater attention to the incidence of depression in college student groups. As it is early days in the progression of COVID 19, the longitudinal mental health changes are as yet unknown. Therefore, further studies are needed to provide insight into the psychological impact of the coronavirus epidemic on the public. The finding that 'feeling extremely scared' had the largest contribution to PTSD and depression after the COVID 2019 outbreak was consistent with previous trauma-related studies (Livanou et al., 2005; Roussos et al., 2005; Tang et al., 2018) . However, the objective factor of 'living in the worst-hit area' had a relatively minor contribution. Fear is an adaptive response that initiates defensive behaviors to protect the self from danger, which means that PTSD can occur when fear is inappropriately regulated (Rau et al., 2005) . A central PTSD problem has been found to be a reduced capacity to suppress fear even in safe conditions (Norrholm et al., 2011) . However, in this Page 13 study, fear was found to be an important predictor for both PTSD and depression. This was in contrast with previous studies that found that impaired fear inhibition was a biomarker for PTSD but not for depression (Jovanovic et al., 2010) . One possible explanation for these results is that in some vulnerable personality types, anger and fear traits may act as moderators or mediators between fear and psychological distress (Lara and Akiskal, 2006) . Given the contagious nature of the COVID 2019 and its long incubation period (14 days or more), many people may have feared that they would be unwittingly infected and would spread the disease to their family members. Therefore, psychological interventions that reduce the fear of the pandemic and instill emotional resilience in the people exposed to the pandemic could be helpful in preventing the development of PTSD or depressive symptoms. Further studies after an exposure to epidemics or traumas are needed to clarify the etiology of and relationship between fear and psychological distress. It is important to note that short but not long sleep durations were found to have a strong association with PTSD and depressive symptoms in the current study. However, these results were in line with a previous meta-analysis that found that short sleep durations (< 6 hours) were associated with a higher risk of depression, and longer sleep durations (>9 hours) were not associated with a significant risk of depression . The strong association between short sleep duration and PTSD in our results, however, was in agreement with previous studies on veterans (Swinkels et al., 2013) and earthquake survivors (Fan et al., 2017) . As it was assumed that sleep duration mediated mental health problems, severe exposure may deteriorate sleep duration, which may then give rise to depression or PTSD, which is consistent with previous SARs studies (Johal, 2009 ). Other sleep parameters or other variables may also have acted as mediators; however, this requires further study. Nonetheless, these results add to previous studies that suggest that strategies to prevent short sleep durations could substantially reduce the risk of psychological problems from pandemic exposure.

153174,"To date, the second-generation reproduction number of the above three families was zero. Three different types of family infections did not cause community infections. Of domestic family cluster infections, two infections did not find an index patient. Despite concerns about infections in the community, no new cases were identified and are still being tracked.  Taiwan's experience demonstrated that domestic family cluster infections have different characteristics and outcomes from couple infection and imported family cluster infections. Compared to the couple infection and imported family cluster infections, the starters (Cases 19, 24, and 27) of domestic family cluster infections showed significantly longer symptom-onset to diagnosis; longer symptom-onset to quarantine or isolation; higher first-generation reproduction number; and more critical presentation with endotracheal tube insertion and ICU care. The starters of domestic family cluster infections were older, had no history of travel, and no obvious contact history. They were not easy to diagnose early, had underlying diseases, involved many contacts, and required arduous and expensive epidemiological investigations, so they also had a higher first-generation reproduction number. The second-generation reproduction number of the above three families was zero implying that immediate responses finally controlled the spread of these family cluster COVID-19 epidemics. Cases 19, 24, and 27 had a longer delay from the onset of symptoms to the diagnosis compared to the starters of other types of family infections. Meanwhile, Case 19 was a taxi driver with many unfamiliar customers. After the diagnosis was determined, the clues were pushed back through the communication log to find the index patient. Regarding Cases 24 and 27, detailed investigations have so far failed to find the index patients. Fortunately, medical staff and CECC remained vigilant and conducted isolation treatment before the diagnosis. Screening unknown causes of pneumonia and isolating and screening all contacts immediately after diagnosing can reduce the spread of the epidemic. The clinical features of COVID-19 range from asymptomatic to mild to critical; most infections are not severe [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] . Fever and cough are the most common symptoms [20] . Few patients experience muscle soreness, headaches, sore throats, and runny noses [17, 20] . Critical disease with respiratory failure, shock, or multi-organ dysfunction was reported in 5% of patients [21] . Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a major complication in critically ill patients. ARDS developed in 20% of patients after a median of 8 days, and the incidence of mechanical ventilation was 12.3% [20] . In another study of 201 hospitalized COVID-19 patients in Wuhan, 41% of patients developed ARDS, which was associated with over 65 years of age and both diabetes and hypertension [22] . Most of the fatal cases occurred in patients with advanced age or underlying medical comorbidities including cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus, chronic lung disease, hypertension, and cancer [20, 23] . The case-fatality rate ranged from 5.8% in Wuhan to 0.7% in the rest of China [24] . People under 50 years of age with no underlying disease and no pneumonia usually show mild manifestations. For mild infections, the recovery time seems to be about two weeks, and for severe illnesses, the recovery time is three to six weeks [25] . In this study, the starters of domestic family cluster infections were at high risk of severe illness or death. The starters of couple infection and imported family clusters were mild patients. The clinical manifestations of these patients were consistent with those in previous studies [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] . All contacts should pay attention to early symptoms such as fever and cough. However, the symptoms of COVID-19 pneumonia are diverse.

153279,"Identification of cases from this sentinel surveillance system helped confirm community transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in Santa Clara County. Among county residents evaluated at participating urgent care centers in early March with respiratory illness and no known exposure to SARS-CoV-2, approximately one quarter had positive test results for influenza, but 11% of patients with negative test results for influenza had positive test results for COVID-19. If it is assumed there were no influenza and SARS-CoV-2 coinfections and that persons with negative test results for influenza and not tested for SARS-CoV-2 were similar to those who were tested, then an estimated 8% (19 of 226) of persons seen at participating urgent care centers with respiratory symptoms had COVID-19. This is similar to the 5% SARS-CoV-2 infection rate identified among patients evaluated for mild influenza-like illness at one Los Angeles medical center during a similar time frame (4). The findings in this report are subject to at least two limitations. First, SARS-CoV-2 testing was performed on a convenience sample of specimens that tested negative for influenza. Second, the findings are based on a small number of patients evaluated for respiratory illness at four participating sentinel sites and might not be representative of the broader community. However, as a result of these data and an increasing number of cases with no known source of transmission in Santa Clara County, the county initiated a series of community mitigation strategies to slow the spread of SARS-CoV-2. On March 9, the county issued recommendations to cancel gatherings of ≥1,000 people and to take action to protect vulnerable populations (e.g., older adults).* On March 16, Santa Clara County and five adjacent counties joined to order all residents to shelter in place and all schools, businesses, and government agencies to cease nonessential operations (5) . Santa Clara County also posted updated community mitigation guidance and recommendations for populations at high risk, long-term care facilities, and hospitals (6) . Early implementation of community intervention is likely essential to maximize its effectiveness in slowing the spread of SARS-CoV-2 (2). Local public health departments can use sentinel surveillance to assess the level of community transmission of COVID-19 and to better guide the selection and implementation of community mitigation measures, including the scale, timing, duration, and settings in which to focus these strategies (7) .

153454,"Based on the COVID-19 cases data collected from March 14 th to April 8 th , we estimated the basic reproduction numberR 0 and the prediction of the epidemic's evolution. According to the comparison between the official epidemic data based on our model (Figure 4 .1) one can see that the simulation curve model of the number of confirmed Infections I(t) and the number of dead people D(t) match the official data curve very well during the period of 30 days. On the one side, the case of this epidemic in Tunisia is not critical: the peak of infected cases less than 700 which was very comfortable than many Arabian countries (Emirate, Qatar, Morocco, Algeria, ...) and also Western countries (Portugal, France, Spania...). On the other side, the number of infected and dead due to this disease remains relatively low in Tunisia compared to what is happening elsewhere in the world. And the most remarkable thing is that this situation is better than our neighbors (Algeria, France, Italy). Health policies are probably there for something but is it enough to have a plausible theory? Based on the data at the start of the disease in March, we can deduce from the theoretical study and the numerical simulations that the modification of the parameter λ 3 generates a consequent variation in the rate of the infected population and deceased persons (Figures 4.8.a-b) . Naturally, the most spectacular case is the case λ 3 = 0 which corresponds to Q=0. In other words, in the absence of a quarantine strategy, we can see that on the 20th day of the epidemic, we get 3,75x10 5 infected people (Figure 4.9 .a). This number is much higher than the current capacity of health structures in Tunisia. Consequently, the choice of the containment strategy considerably reduced the number of dead and infected people. With the absence of drug and vaccination, we found that home quarantine can really limit the spread of the epidemic. However, this strategy cannot last for an infinite time, due to the economic consequences on the country. The indicator of infected cases is not the problem. The exposed cases is the most important indicator. We predicted the initial exposed population to be about 200. And after 50 days in Figure 4 .2, the indicator of infected cases shows less infected people. Accordingly, the government is considering the relaxation of the quarantine strategy. The proposed model is flexible and we believe it could be easily adapted to monitor various infected are as with different restriction policies. In this article, we presented a new model based on nonlinear differential equations allowing to model this COVID-19 in Tunisia. The aim of our work, at first, is to provide initial ideas and guidelines for a quantitative and qualitative study of our considered model. In particular, the positivity, boundness and the existence of a solution are established. The impact of the quarantine strategy is also investigated and discussed by two methods. It thus appears that in addition to a rigorous application of quarantine, accurately nearcasting the epidemic trend and projecting the peak time require real-time data and the knowledge about the implementation resources in order to construct the adequate policy and effective decisions of major public health interventions. We hope our work motivates new research to produce more elaborate and precise methods related to this model or to give significant improvements.

153943,"To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to predict the number of COVID-19 infected persons in India after the 40 days of lockdown. We have used crowd sourced data due to lack of availability of official data. We could not include all the cases in the epidemiological analysis due to unavailability of the demographic details of all the patients. Limitations notwithstanding, there were three key findings. First, the median age of affected individuals is lower than reported in other countries. In study cohorts of Wuhan, the median age of affected patients ranges from 49-56 years 4,22,23 . In previous studies on COVID-19, it has been established that risk increases with age and comorbidities 13,22,23 . The broad based nature of India's population pyramid means there are more people in the younger age group and very few people in the ≥80 years age group. Another reason is that as there is limited evidence of community spread in the epidemic in India so far; it has been reported to be driven by imported cases who mostly belong to the younger age group. In 2018, Indian residents between 35 and 49 years of age took the most holidays outside the nation 24 . On normalizing the percentage of patients in each age group with the corresponding percentage representation of the population, we observed that the highest number of patients is in the 60-79 years age group category. Interestingly, according to this analysis, men in the 60-79 years age group are affected more than the ≥80 years age group. This is something that has not been reported until now and it has to be seen whether this changes as the number of cases in India grows. This is new to the literature of COVID-19 and needs to be studied further. Second, we found a case fatality rate of 2.5%, which is lower than countries like Italy 25 . The reason for this could be that Italy is in the later phases of the epidemic with widespread community transmission and high mortality due to overburdening of the health system. This has also led to focussing testing on severe patients and possible advise to suspected patients with mild symptoms to stay at home. In China, the case fatality rate was found as 2.3%, 14.8% in the above 80 years population, and 8.0% in the 70-79 years population 13 . Our estimate gives a slightly higher value, which may be due a smaller sample size or can also be because mild cases of COVID-19 have so far been missed due to restricted testing strategy during the initial stage. Third, from the SIR model, the values of β and the trend for R t shows that the interventions which were put in place by the Indian government starting from mid-March were partially effective, preventing the scenario where R t can reach even more than four 26 . The increase in β from day eight is probably due to the identification of a cluster in Delhi 27 . Additionally, Indian Council of Medical Research recently updated the testing strategy, which might have increased the detection of the positive cases significantly. According to a study in the early days of the epidemic, Wuhan city and Hubei province reported R t between 1.85 and 4.46, which aligns with our study findings 26 . All over China, the R t varied from 1.23 to 5.77. South Korea, which has high population density like India, had a decreasing trend of R t from 9.72 on 20 February to 1.50 on 7 March. This indicates that the interventions have been helpful in preventing the worst case scenario in India but is unable to prevent the spike in number of cases 27, 28 . At the end of the 40 days lockdown, India is likely to have a significant number of infected persons (110,460 to 220,575) that would include both symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals. It may also enter the exponential growth phase and it would become very difficult to contain at that stage. The situation can still be controlled if R t can be brought down close to one. This indicates the need for more effective strategies and ensuring optimum testing to avoid underestimation of danger. Future research is needed to support the current findings that unlike other countries, in India, COVID-19 is mostly affecting the 20-39 years age group since our data analysis was restricted to individuals in whom data was available. The SIR model used does not account for age-structure or comorbidities. Hence we are addressing more dynamicity and realness by taking into account multiple compartments with robust mathematical assumptions in our future models to study the current pandemic. Comprehensive studies based on the clinical manifestations and laboratory parameters including genomic sequencing to detect mutations of the virus also needs to be done for the Indian population to see if the clinical features and the viral strains differ from other populations. To conclude, the COVID-19 epidemic in India is more affecting younger age groups as compared to other countries. Our mathematical model predicts that India will have a significant number of infected persons after the 40 days lockdown. Hence, strict social distancing, and optimum testing followed by isolation and quarantine are vital elements to control the COVID-19 epidemic.  No competing interests were disclosed. ","To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to predict the number of COVID-19 infected persons in India after the 40 days of lockdown.<q>We have used crowd sourced data due to lack of availability of official data.<q>Second, we found a case fatality rate of 2.

153948,"The patient was later transferred to a designated hospital and died of respiratory failure 4 wk after surgery. The patient had a postoperative fever followed by increasing WBC and CSF leakage during surgery; it would be logical from a neurosurgeon's perspective to speculate intracranial infection. Noticing the cough, doctors scheduled alternative tests which complied with 'fever of unknown etiology, 4 also known as COVID-19 now. Its frequent onset symptom, fever, made COVID-19 deceptive. Following the first COVID-19 case in our department, 4 nurses who contacted with him directly before quarantine without protective equipment were infected, and 10 more staff who did not contact him were also confirmed later. The 14 staff fully recovered and returned back to work as of March 31st. It's worth noting that none of them participated in the surgery. Furthermore, with proper personal protective equipment and precautions since January 11th, none of those who contacted with him directly were infected, including his attending group who paid daily visit to the patient. In our retrospective view, patient quarantine, proper personal protective equipment, and social distancing between medical staff contributed to limiting epidemic among medical staff since the initial outbreak. The median incubation period of COVID-19 was estimated to be 5.1 d, 97.5th percentile was 11.5 d, 5 based on epidemiological characteristics it's reasonable to speculate that he developed a latent infection of SARS-CoV-2 prior operation and stress inflicted by neurosurgical procedure and anesthesia 6 and potential postoperative hypopituitarism 7 might impact his immune system. Transmission from an asymptomatic patient was reported, 8 and higher viral loads were detected soon after symptom onset, with higher viral loads detected in the nose than in the throat. 9 The estimated half-life of SARS-CoV-2 in aerosols was approximately 1.1 to 1.2 h, 10 but it does not necessarily mean the aerosols cannot be filtered by surgical masks or N95 respirators. Endonasal endoscopic surgery is performed in a narrow, longitu-dinal canal, assisted by suction and irrigation. The chance that aerosols and droplets originating in nostrils escape the suction and are inhaled subsequently by surgeons is rare. Therefore, we think it is not wise to cancel all the endonasal endoscopic surgeries especially the emergency ones, such as pituitary apoplexy, and COVID-19 is supposed to be containable when the surgeries are performed in negative pressure operating rooms with sufficient personal protective equipment and the patients are kept under quarantine postoperatively. While we do not encourage elective surgeries during this pandemic, which might impact patients' immune system and put them in conditions vulnerable to COVID-19. The deceptive nature of COVID-19 results from its most frequent onset symptom, fever, a cliché in neurosurgery, which makes it hard for surgeons to differentiate from postoperative intracranial infection. The COIVD-19 epidemic among medical staff in our department was deemed as postoperative rather than intraoperative transmission, and attributed to not applying sufficient personal airway protection. Proper personal protective equipment and social distancing between medical staff contributed to limiting epidemic since the initial outbreak. Emergency endonasal endoscopic surgeries are feasible since COVID-19 is still supposed to be containable when the surgeries are performed in negative pressure operating rooms with sufficient personal protective equipment and the patients are kept under quarantine postoperatively. However, we do not encourage elective surgeries during this pandemic, which might put patients in conditions vulnerable to COVID-19.

153978,"Here we report the transmission and clinical characteristic of 104 outside-Wuhan patients with COVID-19. First, the smoothly increase in the cumulative number of confirmations of the two centers indicates that the timely control measures work well. Second, family clusters represent as the major body of infections, transmission along the chain of 3 ""generations"" was observed. The asymptomatic transmission demonstrated here warned us it may bring more risk to the spread of COVID-19. Third, no gender difference of patients was found, indicating male and female may have the same susceptibility of this illness. Fourth, the differences in demographics and clinical characteristics between imported patients and indigenous cases were not significant. Since the outbreak in Wuhan, it is unclear how many people truly infected and how many infected people of Wuhan has imported to the other cities. Screening the potential infectors related to Wuhan was implemented quickly by the local governments after the announced of Wuhan shutdown. Dynamic analysis of 104 cases from two centers in Hunan province showed that the imported cases mainly appeared during Jan 22, 2019 to Feb 5, 2020, then the indigenous cases became the major body, suggesting the initial cases have been founded over nearly 20 days of screening. Compared with the Accepted Article contemporary growth trend in Wuhan, explosive increase in the confirmed cases was not observed in the two centers from Jan 22, 2019 to Feb 12, 2020, indicating that the timely control measures in the two cities worked well. Yet fundamental information gaps exist on how to accurately assess the transmission efficiency. While the controversy of sharply increased cases and medical shortage in the early and outbreak stage in Wuhan, patients in Wuhan may have limitation to fully reflect the true epidemiological characteristics of this illness. Evidence has suggested person-to-person transmission of COVID-19 via droplets or skin touch 2,3,11 . The data of this study showed a notable feature is clustering occurrence, most patients were infected from their family members, relatives or friends through a close contact. Only 11 (10.53%) of this study patients were sporadic cases that hardly identified infector source, suggesting that community transmission of COVID-19 is not developed rapidly in the two cities; this also matches the smooth growth of total confirmed cases. Of note, strict control measures by the local government produced a powerful effect on the slowing spread. We are eager to know how infectious the virus is. Except the confirmed cases, whether the asymptomatic COVID-19-carriers has the infectious is unclear. A recent study showed that the viral load in the asymptomatic patient was similar to that in the symptomatic patients 12 . Our study directly demonstrated that the asymptomatic patient or viral-carries infected their relatives. Three cases (C37, C44 and C49) infected from the Accepted Article same person (C'3) who ever traveled to Wuhan. But until now, C'3 did not develop any symptoms. Though we did not take a PCR test to confirm whether C'3 was a virus-carrier, the same contact history and the similar onset time of her three relatives indicate that C'3 was an asymptomatic COVID-19-carrier. Five asymptomatic patients were found in this study, one patient (C'4) who infected three family members (C92, C94 and C102) provide evidence that the asymptomatic transmission risks the spread of COVID-19, which brings more difficult to cut off the epidemic's transmission route.

154286,"Health is a state of physical, mental, and social wellbeing and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity. 11 Human health and wellbeing are discretely rooted in being surrounded by a functioning society. The COVID-19 outbreak has induced a global public and mental health crisis as well as a huge psycho-social experiment. We have noticed that quarantine due to the COVID-19 With the current worldwide trend of quarantine and isolation due to Covid-19, this deterioration in mood seems to have occurred sooner than one might have expected. Hawryluck et al 5 conducted a study on psychological effects of quarantine, and reported that quarantined persons exhibited a high prevalence of psychological distress: posttraumatic stress disorder (28.9%) and depression (31.2%). The world has witnessed that because of the coronavirus disease outbreak in December 2019 many countries have been asking their residents to isolate themselves at home or in quarantine premises. For example, authorities in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia reacted to the pandemic as a responsible nation, and on March 25, 2020 decided to enact a lock-down on capital city Riyadh as a part of the fight against Covid-19 outbreak. On Thursday, 26 March, the Saudi authorities imposed a total lockdown in the city Riyadh, along with Makkah and Medina, Islam's two holiest cities, as part of tighter constraints to counter the virus. During the current COVID-19 pandemic, with the current lockdown situation, medical students in Saudi Arabia are living in a quarantine inside their residence facilities. More recently, Röhr et al., 12 has demonstrated that quarantine measures during COVID-19 outbreaks have severe negative consequences for mental health. In another study, Lei et al., 13 identified high prevalence of anxiety and depression among people who quarantined during COVID-19 outbreak in southwestern China. Similarly in the present study, we found that 125 (23.5%) medical students felt disheartened and depressed. The most probable reasons for negative consequences for mental health during quarantine are that people considered it an unpleasant experience, because of having to depart from fellows, friends and family, losing the ability to move about freely, experiencing doubts about the spread of disease, and developing intense feelings and reactions. The quarantine phase is a complex intervention within the jurisdiction of public health. 14 Our results demonstrate two important characteristics related to the COVID-19 quarantine, namely an increase in stress and an increase in dysfunctional learning behaviors. Although, medical students believe that quarantine has not much affected their learning and psychological wellbeing, the students whom we interviewed stated that quarantine has caused them to feel emotionally detached from family, fellows and friends, and has led to a decrease in overall work performance and duration of study. In the past, the quarantine compliance rate has been positive, studies have indicated high levels of acceptance of quarantine among samples of Toronto-area residents (97%) and US citizens (93%) during a SARS 1 pandemic quarantine. 15, 16 In the current study, a good number of responses were also recorded where participants have a difference of opinion. The female and male medical students showed a sense of being emotionally detached from family, fellow professionals and friends, feel depressed and decreased in their overall study work performance and study period. The literature had consistently reported differences occurring concerning stress among males and females. This is constant with preceding research indicating that female physicians are more likely to be emotionally fatigued at the commencement of exhaustion, compared to male physicians. 17 Similarly, female students in the present study were found to be motivated in handling their learning, especially when it came to performing two tasks simultaneously. Brooks et al., 18 reported negative psychological effects including post-traumatic stress symptoms, confusion, and anger due to the COVID-19 outbreak quarantine. The authors concluded that during a long duration quarantine, fear, frustration, inadequate information and financial loss are the main causes of negative psychological impact. Similarly, the present study findings suggest that the reported alterations in attitude and mood may be due to the threatening situation of the COVID-19 pandemic. Medical students, in particular, may feel differently once this situation is over, and explicit research should explore such differences. Both female and male medical students have identified that quarantine has caused them to feel emotionally detached from family, fellows, and friends, and has decreased their overall work performance and study period. The findings also show that one fourth of the medical students who participated in this study felt depressed during the quarantine period of two weeks. The longterm quarantine due to COVID-19 pandemics may cause further worsening in the psychological and learning behaviors of these medical students. The results from this study might provide to health policymakers evidence about the psychological and emotional influences of quarantine on medical students so that they might produce an important guideline for managing the medical students' quarantine. Indeed, we believe that the current results indicate the need for supplementary mental wellbeing interventions for everyone while they are quarantined. This goal could be achieved by using a healthy diet, exercise at home, proper sleep and engaging in healthy physical, intellectual and educational activities. In situations where quarantine is deemed necessary, the policy makers should quarantine individuals for no longer than a required period.

154677,"The COVID-19 epidemic is a rapidly spreading disease that is met with exceptional sanitary measures worldwide to limit its spread. As illustrated in our case series, limiting the spread of the disease has proven to be highly challenging for several reasons. First, hygiene measures such as hand washing, social distancing and sneezing and/or coughing in the elbow are basic measures that only show limited efficacy. In the particular conditions of a recruit school and military barracks, some of these measures are hardly feasible and impractical. Strict contact isolation is required. It has been shown that viable SARS-CoV-2 on plastic surfaces can be present up to 72 hours after inoculation in experimental setting, 9 making contagion through door knobs and scale ramps very likely. 9 It is therefore paramount to ensure separate catering, sanitation and lodging. With increasing case and suspected numbers (patients with SARS-CoV-2 and quarantined MAFs), it can become increasingly difficult to obtain appropriate facilities in a military environment. As emergency solution, we used tents to extend lodging capacity for quarantined MAFs (Figures 1-3) . Our series shall emphasise the psychological burden during the time of quarantine and isolation. 10 Although in the military setting, we had the relative advantage of having to group MAFs for logistical reasons, which resulted in although isolated yet not lonely quarantine conditions. Second, many young people are largely asymptomatic but may be SARS-CoV-2 carriers transmitting the disease. 11 Estimates reach from 18% to at least 59% in some studies. 12 13 Although fever and cough are described as the most common symptoms and sometimes deemed to be typical of COVID-19, 14 it is very important to remember that in young adults, symptomatology can be much milder and quite atypical. Our two patients showed a mild course disease with symptom resolution after few days but continued to be positive for SARS-CoV-2 in nasopharyngeal swabs. This finding underlies the importance of prolonged isolation to reduce further virus transmission, as SARS-CoV-2 can still be proven in apparently healthy adults many days after symptom resolution. 15 This is also paramount for health workers to not underestimate as, if they became infected, the risk of further spreading the disease, while willing to treat it, is high. 15 Covert virus spreading also seems to occur during the preclinical inoculation period. Mean incubation time was reported to be 6.2 days (range 2-14) with asymptomatic carriers before and after the clinical overt phase, if any present. 16 In the preclinical phase, it is important to separate any person with contact to a suspected or confirmed case. On 20 March 2020, the Swiss Government increased quarantine time recommendations from 5 days up to 10 days. Our findings support this decision as it covers more accurately the incubation time for contacts. However, some slightly symptomatic carriers may test negative in PCR of nasopharyngeal swabs. Therefore, it is important to time adequately swabs and to repeat them, if clinical suspicion of COVID-19 is present. Wang et al 17 described the highest sensitivity for PCR for bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (93%) followed by sputum (72%), nasal swabs (63%) and pharyngeal swabs (32%). A combination of different or symptom-oriented swap localisation may be useful. Of note, SARS-CoV-2 can also be transmitted by oral-faecal route with viral shedding proven in stool specimen of patients with COVID-19. 17 The relative lack of sensitivity of PCR, especially in young and healthy population, poses great challenges to epidemic control. 17 18 For that reason, serological testing has gained great interest in the past weeks but still requires further validation. 19 In our case series, none of the asymptomatic close contacts to patients 1 and 2 tested positive for PCR and/or serology. One possible explanation is that hygiene measures during quarantine and isolation were sufficient to avoid further spread. However, considering the high reproduction number of COVID-19, a false-negative PCR from nasopharyngeal swab and false negative serology have to be considered. For the latter, a weak to mild symptomatology could explain the lack of detectable immune reaction. 20 Finally, negative serological testing might be linked to not yet fully validated technology. 19 How covert shedding of SARS-CoV-2 may be reduced in the future, for example by prophylactic hydroxychloroquine, 21 remains unknown but is of great strategic interest for civil and military authorities. Young and healthy patients often show a mild course when infected with SARS-CoV-2. They may be before and after symptom presentation carriers and spreaders of SARS-CoV-2. This factor may lead to significant covert viral transmission. An early and prolonged establishment of isolation and quarantine for patients and close contact persons, respectively, is therefore essential to slow down SARS-CoV-2 epidemic growth, especially in confined space conditions seen in a military setting.

This type of intervention has the potential to revolutionize inpatient medicine. The great hope for our field is that we emerge from this crisis as leaders not only in humanistic patient care, but also as leaders in our health systems and experts in novel technology to deliver quality care. With our national move towards ""social distancing,"" we re-frame that idea to highlight that despite physically distancing, we can still socially connect. This is especially critical for our patients with COVID-19, who are isolated in hospital rooms, unable to see or touch loved ones, and rarely interact with health care providers covered in PPE. Tellepalliative medicine provides the opportunity -particularly by video -to connect to patients, connect them to others, and provide as intimate and interdisciplinary support as possible in these times.

154970,"The main goal of the present study was to determine whether there were mental health problems in medical students during the COVID-19 outbreak quarantine period. According to these results, it can be concluded that approximately one-third of students who participated in the survey were in a state of mild or moderate depression, one-fifth of these students were in a state of mild or moderate anxiety, and merely one or two were severe. These results are consistent with published findings on individual adjustment during the COVID-19 epidemic in general public samples (8) , even for those who were not in direct contact with the disease, illustrating that the psychiatric impact of the disease on the general population is significant. As of the end of January 2020, a nationwide quarantine was carried out, and people who were isolated in their homes were potentially apprehensive about the possibility of infection, and anxious over the high infectivity and uncertain mortality rate of COVID-19. In addition, the anxiety could spread to family members who are also concurrently isolated in their homes. Students had been under quarantine in their homes during the period of the COVID-19 outbreak, which lasted for more than three months. The prolonged time of isolation and the associated consequences might induce depression and anxiety among these students. For students in a state of depression or anxiety, most of them were mild or moderate, and merely one or two were severe. However, there were no gender differences in the prevalence of depression and anxiety, which might suggest that both genders were equally psychologically affected by the COVID-10 epidemic. This is consistent with findings from a previous study on the SARS epidemic (16) . Contrary to the conclusions from a prior study, which reported that college students whose family and university were in the same city (Beijing) demonstrated lower psychological symptoms than their peers whose families lived in other cities during the SARS outbreak (16) , the present survey revealed that students in Hubei province and outside Hubei province had no significant difference in the prevalence of depression and anxiety. The possible reason for this is because only a small proportion of students in Hubei province participated in the survey. Although a greater impact may have been observed for senior students, the results of the survey revealed that there was no significant difference in the prevalence of depression and anxiety among the different grades. This may have been affected by the small number of senior students who participated in the present study. Although the present survey mainly screened for depression and anxiety, a previous study demonstrated that the progression of negative emotions such as anxiety, which are experienced in the early stages of disasters, can lead to post-traumatic stress disorder when left without intervention. However, if early mental health care measures are implemented, such consequences can be obviated (17) . It was advantageous that the majority of students who were in a depressed or anxious state had mild or moderate symptoms. This allowed for a favorable outcome when appropriate measures were taken. Many solutions presently available in China and worldwide can be used for individuals with mental health problems. As indicated by one of the recently published articles, online mental health education using social networking sites and applications, such as WeChat, Weibo, and TikTok, has been widely used. Furthermore, literature on mental health education has been expeditiously published, and free electronic copies have been distributed to the public during the outbreak (8) . Moreover, the American Psychiatry Association has also provided a great deal of guidance on their website (). Meanwhile, a study on the experience of stressors, coping, and adjustment among college students during the 2003 SARS epidemic also provided some suggestions for university counseling services (16) . Students should be instructed on where and how to obtain the resources, since excessive information has been disseminated on the internet. This may make it difficult for people to access the useful messages. Online courses could be launched, which could make the life of students more exciting, and this could also provide a platform for students to communicate with others. As for students with irregular living habits at home, encouraging them to abandon these habits is also necessary, since bad habits may also result in bad moods. Apart from offering some platforms for the relief of students by themselves, teachers should pay more attention to students with moderate or severe depression or anxiety. Helping them solve the problems they encounter is also a way to relieve tension and anxiety. Nevertheless, if the symptoms of a student is too severe to be resolved by the teacher, professional diagnosis and treatment should be implemented. In general, students, especially college students, are a special group that should not be ignored during the quarantine period. Not only students in Hubei province, but also students outside Hubei should be given particular attention. The present study is one of the few studies that investigated the mental health conditions of medical college students during the COVID-19 epidemic. The present study implies that universities need to take measures to prevent, identify, and deal with the mental health problems of students during largescale stressors (e.g. the outbreak of an infectious disease and natural disasters). Effective screening procedures would help to identify students who are at high risk of developing mental health problems, and effective interventions could prevent serious consequences.

155050,"China has experienced SARS in 2003 and MERS in 2012 of the coronavirus outbreak. 11 As prof. Drazen said, the SARS shows that when confronted by a common enemy, we can forget our differences and work together fruitfully. This was the most important lesson from SARS, let us hope that we can all benefit from it. 12 Recently, the COVID-19 infection occurred and spread in the mainland of China, but the proportion of mild and asymptomatic cases versus severe and fatal cases for COVID-19 infection is currently still unknown that hampers realistic assessment of the virus's epidemic potential and complicates the outbreak response, 5 furthermore, the recent publications on the epidemiological and clinical characteristics mainly came from Wuhan, 6 , 7 , 13 the information about the imported city is exceedingly rare. On the basis of this study, firstly we provided the proportion of severe versus common cases of the COVID-19 infection, which was approximately 1:4, the ratio of severe to mild, non-pneumonia and asymptomatic cases were 18%, 73%, 4% and 5% respectively, the changes and prognosis of those four categories should be future observed in hospitals. 13 asymptomatic cases were the close contacts who were found by medical observation in this study. If not insulated for medical observation, they would not seek health care or visit hospital and cannot be found in the special period, and will spread to the other close contacts. [15] [16] Therefore, to identify and control the non-pneumonia and asymptomatic cases are the important measures to prevent transmission on the COVID-19. The age of patients was from 6 months to 94-year-old, the majority of patients were young adults (77.4%), there was no significant difference between male and female in our study, population was generally susceptible. The patients were mainly residents of Beijing (73.3%), while the other patients mostly came from Wuhan(20.2%). But 89.1% of the residents of Beijing had been travel to Wuhan or contacted with the confirmed case in 14 days especially in the early stage of COVID-19 infection, after Feb. 1, the number of local confirmed cases began to exceed imported cases. In this study, 133 patients from more than 20 families were infected, same as Wuhan, the infection of COVID-19 in Beijing was of clustering onset too. [13] [14] Therefore, person-to-person transmission is the main route of transmission. The most common symptoms of illness onset were fever, cough, fatigue, and headache, severe cases with dyspnea, the results were consistent with the new coronavirus pneumonial diagnosis and treatment program (3rd, in Chinese) published by the National Health Commission of China. 9 The median time of incubation period was 6.7 days. The median time from illness onset to visit hospital and from visit hospital to defined confirmed case were 4.5 and 2.1 days respectively. The fatality of patients infected by COVID-19 in Beijing was 0.9%, significantly lower than the whole national average level, and not resembling that in previous studies. 6 , 13 The rate of discharged of Beijing was significantly higher than the whole national average level. Among the top 10 provinces and cities with accumulative confirmed cases of COVID-19 cases, the ranking of Beijing has fallen faster than other provinces. Therefore, Beijing was successful in preventing and controlling on the COVID-19 infection, it benefits from the correct leadership and experience of SARS in 2003. From the perspective of death of SARS, as of May 11, 2003 , the fatality of the SARS was 5.0%, while the COVID-19 was 2.4% in the whole national, there was no significant with the fatality between SARS and the COVID-19 infection in the early stage, but different in the later, the fatality rate of SARS was up to 10% at last. 17 This study has some limitations. First, only the COVID-19 confirmed cases transferred by EMS in Beijing were included, the first admission to the designated hospitals cases were not enrolled, nor other provinces or cities which dominated by imported. It would be better to cover as wide population as possible, to get more accurate results. Second, the observation time of this study is only 22 days, which is a bit short, and indicators such as discharge rate and fatality need further observation. Last, the official data of 2003 SARS is a month later than the outbreak, its epidemic development curve is not precise. However, this study represents characteristics of early stage of COVID-19 in Beijing, which has certain value for future control and research. In conclusion, the characteristics of patients infected with COVID-19 in Beijing were obviously different from Wuhan with a lower fatality and higher discharge rate, new infected patients has shifted from the imported to local gradually. The next step in preventing and controlling the COVID-19 infection should be focused on the early isolation of patients and quarantine for close contacts in families and communities.

155195,"Within the current study, almost the entire sample stated they spend more time at home now compared to pre-pandemic, with roughly half reporting they spend nearly all J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f waking hours at home. Thus, the premise for the study, increased time at home during self-quarantine, was validated. Twenty-two percent of the sample stated they gained between 5-10 pounds. Eating behaviors reported to increase during the quarantine were, ""eating more often with friends and family,"" ""eating in response to sight and smell of food,"" ""eating because you crave certain foods,"" ""eating in response to stress,"" ""eating when bored,"" and ""snacking more after dinner."" Of those, eating behaviors linked with weight gain are ""eating in response to sight and smell,"" ""eating in response to stress,"" and ""snacking after dinner."" Increased eating in response to sight and smell during quarantine could be considered a component of the psychological variables impulsivity and disinhibition. Impulsivity is a hasty reaction to an outside stimulus without concern for negative consequences and has been linked with binge eating (17) . Disinhibition, also called mindless eating, or the disruption of an inhibited state where loss of control over eating may occur is also linked with weight gain (18) . It appears that during quarantine, those who gained weight simply ate because food was available, not necessarily because of internal hunger cues. Prior research shows that when subjects are provided with large portions of food for many days, they will consistently overeat even though they report decreased hunger and increased satiety (19) . On the other hand, although not directly measured, those who maintained or lost weight more than likely practiced dietary restraint. Dietary restraint is defined as the intention to restrict food intake to control body weight and shape and has been shown to predict long-term weight loss (20) . Practicing dietary restrain during self-quarantine should be encouraged.

155498,"During the period of an epidemic when human-to-human transmission is established and reported case numbers are rising exponentially, nowcasting and forecasting are of crucial importance for public health planning and control domestically and internationally. 39, 40 In this study, we have estimated the outbreak size of 2019-nCoV thus far in Wuhan and the probable extent of disease spread to other cities domestically. Our findings suggest that independent self-sustaining human-to-human spread is already present in multiple major Chinese cities, many of which are global transport hubs with huge numbers of both inbound and outbound passengers (eg, Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Shenzhen). Therefore, in the absence of substantial public health interventions that are immediately applied, further international seeding and subsequent local establishment of epidemics might become inevitable. On the present trajectory, 2019-nCoV could be about to become a global epidemic in the absence of mitigation. Nevertheless, it might still be possible to secure containment of the spread of infection such that initial imported seeding cases or even early local transmission does not lead to a large epidemic in locations outside Wuhan. To possibly succeed, substantial, even draconian measures that limit population mobility should be seriously and immediately considered in affected areas, as should strategies to drastically reduce within-population contact rates through cancellation of mass gatherings, school closures, and instituting work-from-home arrange ments, for example. Precisely what and how much should be done is highly contextually specific and there is no one-size-fits-all set of prescriptive interventions that would be appropriate across all settings. Should containment fail and local transmission is established, mitigation measures according to plans that had been drawn up and executed during previous major outbreaks, such as those of SARS, MERS, or pandemic influenza, could serve as useful reference templates. The overriding epidemiological priority to inform public health control would be to compile and release a line list of suspected, possible, probable, and confirmed cases and close contacts that is updated daily and linked to clinical outcomes and laboratory test results. A robust line list is essential for the generation of accurate and precise epidemiological parameters as inputs into transmission models to inform situational awareness and optimising the responses to the epidemic. 41 Additionally, given the extent of spread and level of public concern it has already generated, the clinical spectrum and severity profile of 2019-nCoV infections needs rapid ascertainment by unbiased and reliable methods in unselected samples of cases, especially those with mild or subclinical presentations. The modelling techniques that we used in this study are very similar to those used by other researchers who are working towards the same goal of characterising the epidemic dynamics of 2019-nCoV (Zhanwei Du, University of Texas at Austin, personal communication). [42] [43] [44] [45] The consensus on our methodology provides some support for the validity of our nowcasts and forecasts. An additional strength of our study is that our model is parameterised with the latest mobility data from OAG and Tencent. Nonetheless, our study has several major limitations. First, we assumed that travel behaviour was not affected by disease status and that all infections eventually have symptoms (albeit possibly very mild). We would have underestimated the outbreak size in Greater Wuhan if individuals with increased risk of infection (eg, confounded by socioeconomic status) were less likely to travel internationally or if the proportion of asymptomatic infections were substantial. Second, our estimate of transmis sibility and outbreak size was somewhat sensitive to our assumption regarding the zoonotic mechanism that initiated the epidemic at Wuhan. However, our overall conclusion regarding the extent of case exportation in major Chinese cities would remain the same even for our lowest estimate of transmissibility ( figure 3) . Third, our epidemic forecast was based on inter-city mobility data from 2019 that might not necessarily reflect mobility patterns in 2020, especially in the presence of current public vigilance and response regarding the health threat posed by 2019-nCoV (appendix p 5). Fourth, little is known regarding the seasonality of coro navirus transmission. If 2019-nCoV, similar to influenza, has strong seasonality in its transmission, our epidemic forecast might not be reliable. Identifying and eliminating the zoonotic source remains an important task to prevent new animal-tohuman seeding events. The renewal of a complete ban on market trading and sale of wild game meat in China on Jan 26 can provide only temporary suspension of demand, even if completely adhered to. 46 Vaccine platforms should be accelerated for real-time deployment in the event of a second wave of infections. Above all, for health protection within China and internationally, especially those locations with the closest travel links with major Chinese ports, preparedness plans should be readied for deployment at short notice, including securing supply chains of pharmaceuticals, personal pro tective equipment, hospital supplies, and the necessary human resources to deal with the consequences of a global outbreak of this magnitude.

155540,"We have proposed a methodology for the estimation of the key epidemiological parameters as well as the modelling and forecasting of the spread of the COVID-19 epidemic in Hubei, China by considering publicly available data from the 11th of January 2020 to the 10th of February 2020. By the time of the acceptance of our paper, according to the official data released on the 29th of February, the cumulative number of confirmed infected cases in Hubei was �67,000, that of recovered was �31,300 and the death toll was �2,800. These numbers are within the lower bounds and expected trends of our forecasts from the 10th of February that are based on Scenario I. Importantly, by assuming a 20-fold scaling of the confirmed cumulative number of the infected cases and a 40-fold scaling of the confirmed number of the recovered cases in the total population, forecasts show a decline of the outbreak in Hubei at the end of February. Based on this scenario the case fatality rate in the total population is of the order of �0.15%. At this point we should note that our SIRD modelling approach did not take into account many factors that play an important role in the dynamics of the disease such as the effect of the incubation period in the transmission dynamics, the heterogeneous contact transmission network, the effect of the measures already taken to combat the epidemic, the characteristics of the population (e.g. the effect of the age, people who had already health problems). Also the estimation of the model parameters is based on an assumption, considering just the first period in which the first cases were confirmed and reported. Of note, COVID-19, which is thought to be principally transmitted from person to person by respiratory droplets and fomites without excluding the possibility of the fecal-oral route [21] had been spreading for at least over a month and a half before the imposed lockdown and quarantine of Wuhan on January 23, having thus infected unknown numbers of people. The number of asymptomatic and mild cases with subclinical manifestations that probably did not present to hospitals for treatment may be substantial; these cases, which possibly represent the bulk of the COVID-19 infections, remain unrecognized, especially during the influenza season [22] . This highly likely gross under-detection and underreporting of mild or asymptomatic cases inevitably throws severe disease courses calculations and death rates out of context, distorting epidemiologic reality. Another important factor that should be taken into consideration pertains to the diagnostic criteria used to determine infection status and confirm cases. A positive PCR test was required to be considered a confirmed case by China's Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia Diagnosis and Treatment program in the early phase of the outbreak [14] . However, the sensitivity of nucleic acid testing for this novel viral pathogen may only be 30-50%, thereby often resulting in false negatives, particularly early in the course of illness. To complicate matters further, the guidance changed in the recently-released fourth edition of the program on February 6 to allow for diagnosis based on clinical presentation, but only in Hubei province [14] . The swiftly growing epidemic seems to be overwhelming even for the highly efficient Chinese logistics that did manage to build two new hospitals in record time to treat infected patients. Supportive care with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) in intensive care units (ICUs) is critical for severe respiratory disease. Large-scale capacities for such level of medical care in Hubei province, or elsewhere in the world for that matter, amidst this public health emergency may prove particularly challenging. We hope that the results of our analysis contribute to the elucidation of critical aspects of this outbreak so as to contain the  In the digital and globalized world of today, new data and information on the novel coronavirus and the evolution of the outbreak become available at an unprecedented pace. Still, crucial questions remain unanswered and accurate answers for predicting the dynamics of the outbreak simply cannot be obtained at this stage. We emphatically underline the uncertainty of available official data, particularly pertaining to the true baseline number of infected (cases), that may lead to ambiguous results and inaccurate forecasts by orders of magnitude, as also pointed out by other investigators [1, 17, 22] .

156638,"COVID-19 is an acute infectious disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 that is predominantly characterized by pulmonary inflammation, but can also involve other organs. 5 The main routes of transmission are droplet and contact transmission, involving both animal-to-person and person-to-person transmission. Aerosol transmission is possible when exposed to a high aerosol concentration for a long period in a relatively closed environment. The incubation period ranges from 1 to 14 days, most commonly 3 to 7 days, and the elderly are more susceptible to this infection. The major clinical manifestations are fever, fatigue, and dry cough and can be classified as mild, moderate, severe, or critical. 6 The principal confirmatory laboratory test is the SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid test, which is the gold standard for diagnosing COVID-19. Additionally, reduced total white blood cell and lymphocyte counts and elevated liver enzymes and lactate dehydrogenase levels are observed in some patients along with elevated CRP levels and erythrocyte sedimentation rate noted in the majority of patients. Our patient was from an epidemic area, and the clinical manifestations were presented with a history of intermittent fever which was accompanied by a wet cough. Laboratory tests demonstrated a reduced total white blood cell count and elevated CRP level which was consistent with the findings in other reports. Imaging investigations are vital for the management of COVID-19. Owing to the fast imaging speed and high-intensity resolution, chest CT, especially high-resolution CT, has become the preferred imaging modality for suspected COVID-19 cases or patients who have negative results on nucleic acid tests. Based on the lung imaging findings, COVID-19 can be divided into four stages. While there is overlap between the imaging manifestations of each stage, the findings in the critical stage are relatively specific. [7] [8] [9] In the early stage, diffuse subpleural GGOs or small nodular opacities can be found in both lungs, with interlobular septal thickening and fine grid-like shadows observed locally, with the lesions mostly located subpleurally in the lung periphery. In the progressive stage, the lesions undergo rapid progression and changes involving multiple lung lobes and spread from the periphery to the center of both lungs. Some GGOs will fuse into patches with a significant increase in intrapulmonary consolidation. In addition, the ""crazy-paving"" sign and air bronchograms can be observed, along with significant interlobular septal thickening that may be accompanied by fibrous cord-like shadows, often without pleural effusion. In the critical phase, lesions may increase by more than 50% within 48 hours, and both lungs may show extensive or diffuse consolidation, even presenting with ""white-out lung"" in severe cases. Air bronchograms can still be observed locally and may be accompanied by a small amount of unilateral or bilateral pleural effusion; lymphadenopathy, meanwhile, is seldom observed. In the recovery stage, bilateral lesions are gradually absorbed and start shrinking, meanwhile, dispersed fibrous cord-like shadows can be observed, showing interstitial fibrotic changes. The imaging manifestations of the present case were consistent with those of previous reports. With respect to the above stages, the case reported here tended toward an imaging diagnosis of the progressive stage. However, the imaging findings of COVID-19 lack specificity and CT should mainly be used in differentiating the disease from other viral pneumonias. Viral pneumonia generally manifests as pulmonary interstitial changes with alveolar wall edema. The CT findings mainly include GGOs, partial fusion and consolidation, interlobular septal thickening, grid-like shadows, and fibrous cord-like shadows. Given the similarities in the imaging findings of different viral pneumonias, however, a diagnosis of COVID-19 should be considered only after taking into account the clinical data, epidemiology, and laboratory test results, and the final diagnosis should be confirmed by pathogenic tests. Furthermore, COVID-19 must be differentiated from non-viral pneumonia such as bacterial pneumonia and mycoplasma pneumonia (both common in children and adolescents), non-infectious diseases such as acute eosinophilic pneumonia and allergic pneumonia, and mixed infections. Chest CT enables the early detection of pulmonary abnormalities in COVID-19, thus playing a decisive role in the rapid diagnosis, quarantine, and treatment as well as the subsequent evaluation of therapeutic efficacy. Diagnosis of COVID-19 through combining epidemiological, clinical, and imaging findings is generally not difficult; final diagnosis, however, requires pathogenic examination.

157171,"To the best of our knowledge, only one previously published study assessed the knowledge of Jordanian university students about COVID-19. However, the study only involved undergraduate students of Mutah University which is a government university located at the south of Jordan (17) . The current study comprehensively assessed the knowledge and source of information about COVID-19 among postgraduate and undergraduate students from different fields of study in different government and private universities distributed over three zones: the north, middle and south of Jordan. The overall student COVID-19 knowledge score was 80.1%, indicating that most students were knowledgeable about this pandemic. This was expected because the survey was conducted just 1 d after the government-initiated lockdown of Jordan to control the COVID-19 pandemic, and 17 d after the first confirmed case of COVID-19 was reported in this country. Since then, the number of cases slowly increased during the conduct of the study. The present results are similar to those reported by Clements (18) who indicated that the average public knowledge score of US residents 2 months after illness began in the USA was 80%. However, the knowledge score reported in the current study is lower than that reported by Zhong et al. (19) who found that the overall knowledge score was 90% among Chinese residents during the rapid rise period of COVID-19 cases in Hubei Province, and Erfani et al. (20) who found that the average public knowledge of Iranians was 90% regarding general characteristics of COVID-19, and 85% regarding the mode of transmission and categories of people at high risk of COVID-19. On the other hand, Bhagavathula et al. (21) reported that a significant proportion of healthcare workers displayed poor knowledge about COVID-19 infection, particularly its transmission and incubation period. The reasonably high knowledge score among Jordanian students likely resulted from their exposure to government information about COVID-19 which occurred before application of the quarantine. Furthermore, the overwhelming news reports about COVID-19, and the WHO characterization of the disease as a pandemic due its high pathogenicity and transmissibility (3) might also have increased the students' knowledge of COVID-19. It was observed that most students obtained their information about COVID-19 from the internet and social media as well as mass media including TV. Similarly, Alzoubi et al. (17) stated that social media was the most common source of information for Mutah university students. However, in the current study, medical sciences and postgraduate students, who were the most knowledgeable groups, used scientific websites and articles significantly more than their counterparts. Thus, the knowledge category was significantly associated with the major discipline and level of education. Unsurprisingly, other variables had no significant effect on the knowledge of students since the disease is considered as a serious threat worldwide. Except for the type of SARS-Cov-2 viral genetic material and mortality rate of infection, 71-99.4% of students correctly answered the questions in the general knowledge of COVID-19. It is worth mentioning that the lower knowledge scores were related to the questions that required deep knowledge. About 72% of students were aware that there is no vaccine for COVID-19 and that antibiotics are not effective for its treatment. At the time of writing this report, there were no FDA approved vaccines or drugs for the prevention or treatment of COVID-19. Consequently, the current management of the illness includes prevention of disease by applying control measures and supportive care of infected patients by providing supplemental oxygen and mechanical ventilation (22) . These preventive measures were adapted from previous outbreaks including the SARS 2003 epidemic (12) . Students also were knowledgeable regarding transmission mode and people at high risk of COVID-19 with a range of correct answers from 60.1 to 94.7%. Students showed extensive knowledge of the actual route of COVID-19 transmission such as saliva and nasal drip during talking or coughing and sneezing by infected individuals, kissing and shaking hands with SARS-COV-2 carriers, handling a patient's objects and materials as well as touching contaminated surfaces. This indicated that students were knowledgeable of these routes and could take steps to avoid getting sick. A major portion of the students knew that COVID-19 is not transmitted by sexual routes, consuming food or through the air. Ong et al. (23) pointed out that airborne transmission has not occurred in an analysis of approximately 75,500 cases in China. About 40% of students believed that children under 5 years of age are at high risk of developing COVID-19. However, based on the reports of WHO (3) and CDC (1, 5) , children are rarely infected and when this occurs it is generally with mild symptoms. The European Center of Disease Prevention and Control (24) reported that children under 10 years old represent a very small proportion (1%) of COVID-19 cases. On the other hand, the majority of students were aware that the elderly and persons with co-morbidities are at high risk of COVID-19. It was proven that people over 60 years old and those at all ages with underlying conditions; such as diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, cancer and chronic respiratory disease are at the highest risk of severe COVID-19 illness and even death (25) . The vast majority of students (>90%) were aware of the most common symptoms of COVID-19 such as fever, dry cough and shortness of breath. In contrast, large proportions of students (55.7-71.1%) were not knowledgeable about the less common symptoms such as weakness, rhinorrhea, vomiting and diarrhea. WHO (25) reported that the typical symptoms of COVID-19 include fever (87.9%), dry cough (67.7%), fatigue (38.1%), sputum production (33.4%), shortness of breath (18.6%), myalgia (14.8%), sore throat (13.9%), headache (13.6%), chills (11.4%), vomiting (5.0%), nasal congestion (4.8%), diarrhea (3.7%), and hemoptysis (0.9%) plus conjunctival congestion (0.8%) based on 56,000 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases. Similarly, ECDC (24) reported that fever, dry cough, sore throat and general weakness were the most common symptoms of COVID-19 in 14,000 cases from 13 countries in Europe. In the current study, 79.2-88.3% of the students were knowledgeable that pneumonia and bronchitis are complications of COVID-19. However, about 55.2% of students were aware that the disease may cause organ failure, and only 4.6% knew that sepsis is one of the COVID-19 complications. These low values could be because sepsis and multi-organ failure occur in severe COVID-19 cases which contribute to only 4% of infected people (3, 24) . These complications can lead to a high mortality rate among infected persons and the vast majority of students (91.2%) in the current study recognized that severe respiratory failure could lead to death. The WHO (12) expected that SARS-COV would not be the last emerging novel virus and it was followed by influenza A, H1N1, MERS, Ebola, Zika, and SARS-COV-2 viruses during the last two decades of the 21st century. Further, it is also expected that new viral diseases will evolve in the future at higher rate than at this period in time. Therefore, more fundamental information about viruses should be made available to the public facilitating the identification of risk factors for these diseases which should enable communities to deal with future emerging viral infections effectively and rapidly (26) . Based on the results of the current study, it is suggested that public health authorities in collaboration with universities continuously implement health education programs about viral infections and other infectious diseases to university students through a required credit course during their studies, particularly those in non-medical programs to enhance their knowledge regarding these diseases so that they might directly engage in the implementation of protective health measures to contain infectious diseases such as the COVID-19 pandemic. This study showed good knowledge of COVID-19 among 2083 postgraduate or undergraduate students from different universities in Jordan with an overall knowledge score of 80.1%. The students showed extensive knowledge of most questions about general information, transmission route, symptoms, complications and people at high risk of COVID-19. However, the students' knowledge was significantly affected by the college of study and education level where medical and postgraduate students had the highest levels of knowledge. The least common symptoms (such as vomiting and diarrhea) and complications (such as weakness and sepsis) were not well recognized by students. Therefore, these results could help in assessing the actual situation to apply educational health programs and measures.

These mean estimates increased only slightly when increasing the mean incubation period. For the Singapore data, allowing the serial interval to be negative decreased the estimated mean generation time from 5.20 days, when restricting missing serial intervals to be positive, to 3.86 days (95% CrI: 2.22-5.60), when allowing them to be negative. For the Tianjin data, the baseline estimate of the mean generation time (3.95 days) is about the same as when allowing serial intervals to be negative in the Singapore data. However, there were already some negative serial intervals among the reported links in the Tianjin data, which may explain this lower estimate. The difference in these estimates could also be the result of differences in containment strategies. When allowing for negative serial intervals in the Tianjin data, the mean generation time decreased to 2.90 days (95% CrI: 1.85-4.12). The sensitivity analyses showed that the assumptions made about the incubation period have only moderate impact on the results. On the other hand, assumptions made about the underlying transmission network (e.g. acknowledging possibly negative serial intervals) had a large impact on our results.

158068,"The ongoing outbreak of COVID-19, starting in December 2019, has quickly become a sweeping and unprecedented global challenge. Because COVID-19 can spread from person to person [10, 11] , a major challenge in controlling the disease is recognizing and quarantining potential infectious sources as soon as possible [12] . As Li reported, the median incubation period is 4-5.2 days and the 95th percentile of the distribution is 12.5 days [13] . Unfortunately, COVID-19 patients can be infective before the disease onset and maintain infective ability during the convalescent phase [3, 4, 14] . According to Cao's report [15] , the shortest observed duration of viral shedding was 8 days, whereas the longest was 37 days. However, to date, no article has reported what kind of patients have a longer viral shedding time. In the family we report here, the index patient, Case 1, was from Wuhan and had contact with COVID-19 patients before she returned to Yiyang city. The other 4 family members were from Yiyang and had never left Yiyang, nor did they have contact with any other COVID-19 patients. It is most likely that Case 1 was the infective source in this family. By further examining their epidemiological data, we find that the incubation period of COVID-19 and the shedding duration of SARS-CoV2 might be extremely long in this case. The index patient did not develop atypical symptoms (including a mild cough and a runny nose) until 28 days after she had returned from Wuhan. Remarkably, Case 1 was immunocompromised due to her long-term use of oral prednisone, which might explain why she did not develop typical symptoms at first and why she had a longer duration of viral shedding. In summary, it is important to recognize potential patients who might have no or only mild symptoms. Therefore, we highly recommend that all people with an exposure history be strictly quarantined, and for immunocompromised people with long-term use of glucocorticoids, this time should not be limited to 14 days.

158103,"Abstract Objective The objective of our study was to introduce community quarantine strategy against coronavirus disease 2019(COVID-19) in Anhui and evaluate the effectiveness of community quarantine based on trauma center (TC) patients. Method The structure of community quarantine strategy was illustrated. Distribution of injuries among patients in two TCs between January 24, 2020 and February 24, 2020 was described. Multiple linear regression was used to analyze the correlation between the distribution of Injuries in TCs and the number of COVID-19-associated cases. Results A total of 757 TC patients in the two hospitals were enrolled. The number of traffic injuries and outdoor injuries showed a significant decrease in the early stage and began to increase on February 17. The number of indoor injuries neither decreased nor increased. Multiple linear regression analysis revealed a significant correlation between COVID-19-associated cases and traffic and outdoor injuries Conclusion From the perspective of the injuries in TCs, community quarantine strategy was effectively implemented and significantly slowed the outbreak of COVID-19 in Anhui. However, the implementation and maintenance of the strategy is costly and requires the participation of the entire population.","Abstract Objective The objective of our study was to introduce community quarantine strategy against coronavirus disease 2019(COVID-19) in Anhui and evaluate the effectiveness of community quarantine based on trauma center (TC) patients.<q>Results A total of 757 TC patients in the two hospitals were enrolled.<q>The number of traffic injuries and outdoor injuries showed a significant decrease in the early stage and began to increase on February 17.

158128,"The world is undergoing a COVID-19 epidemic. Although the WHO is delaying official declaration, the signs indicating that a pandemic has already begun are showing up not only in Asia, but also in Europe, the Middle East, Africa, and South America. The R is an important epidemiologic factor in evaluating the level of epidemics and selecting appropriate prevention and intervention policies. However, in the case of COVID-19, various pieces of epidemiological information including R is not known as it is a new infectious disease, and it is necessary for each country to quickly review them as they change according to the progress of the epidemic. In Korea, the number of infected people continuously increases every day since the first case on January 20, 2020. The results of the study indicate that the values of R for COVID-19 are significantly different at the early stage without spreading within the community (from January 19, 2020 to February 10, 2020, based on symptom onset date) and in the case of Daegu and NGP where the number of confirmed cases are rapidly increasing since the diagnosis of patient #31 on February 18, 2020. The initial R for Korea was about 0.56, which was significantly less than the R= 3.6 minus 4.6 calculated for the epidemic in Hubei, China, and also markedly smaller than the estimates that have previously been published (from 2.2 [95% CI, 1.4 to 3.9] to 3.58 [95% CI, 2.89 to 4.39]) [5, 6] . Even considering the errors arising from the undetected cases in the initial stage of the epidemic, the initial estimate of R for Korea shows that the infection was effectively controlled as a result of the intervention policy such as the screening by the quarantine authorities, patient isolation, and management of whose who came in contact with the infected. After February 18, 2020, the R for the Daegu/NGP epidemic was 3.5, which was less than the value during the initial epidemic in Hubei, China (approximately R = 4) but was still far greater than the national value in the initial stage. The case of Daegu/NGP shows the spread of COVID-19 under special circumstances. It is postulated that the number of people infected with COVID-19 increased sharply after people attended the massive religious service at Shincheonji Church in Daegu/NGP. In addition, the case of transmission within the Cheongdo Daenam Hospital also shows R that is significantly higher than that of the national estimate due to the continued close contact between patients and medical staff in a confined space. The number is much higher than 2.28 (95% CI, 2.06 to 2.52), which was the R for the initial stage in a study on the Japanese cruise ship (Diamond Princess) [7] . This study shows the R for the transmission between humans without transmission by animals compared to previous studies [5, 6] in an environment that perfectly matches the premise for an infectious disease model in which the total population is relatively fixed. For the case of Daegu/NGP, it can be seen that the β was greater than that within the cruise ship due to the close contact that occurred under special circumstances. The results of predicting R for Daegu/NGP suggested that only using preventive measures such as keeping track of those who came in contact with the infected, as used in the early stage of COVID-19 transmission, was insufficient to prevent the spread in the region. As demonstrated by the results of the simulation, it is possible to reduce the overall size of the epidemic as well as the number of patients during the peak period with a strict prevention policy that reduces COVID-19 transmission, in addition to the initial prevention method. To achieve this, it is necessary to implement the preventive measures that reduce the probability of transmission upon contact with an infected person, the level of contact, and the duration of transmission, all of which affect the R. For example, in order to reduce the probability of transmission upon contact with an infected person, it is necessary to wear a mask when visiting a crowded place or a medical institution, and to engage in social distancing to limit contact with people as much as possible. Also, the current prevention policy of quickly identifying, diagnosing, and isolating infected people is essential to reduce the transmission period. As there is no treatment for COVID-19 with verified effects yet, the transmission period cannot be reduced by using treatment for patients, as in the case for influenza. Table 2 for scenarios). The modeling results in this study do not take into account those who are under self-quarantine upon contact with an infected person or the transmission by an asymptomatic patient, and do not show the effects of transmission by and management of asymptomatic infectious people, or the effects of managing those under self-quarantine. As shown by Tang et al. [8] , management of asymptomatic infectious people through intensive tracking of those who have been exposed and self-isolation are both effective in reducing the R. The quarantine authorities have upgraded the infectious disease crisis warning to the highest level ('Serious') on February 23, 2020, and are implementing special preventive measures in Daegu/NGP. In addition to preparing a dedicated team for managing self-isolators to ensure they remain in isolation, preventive policies such as securing the list of names for Shincheonji Daegu Church attendees to test and isolate them and banning Shincheonji gatherings, which were the source of massive transmission, are being implemented with the expectation to show results soon. The limitations of this study are as follows: first, the symptom onset dates for patients could not be used in the Daegu/NGP model and only the dates for confirmed diagnosis were used. Therefore, there is a possibility that the predicted schedule for actual patient occurrence may appear earlier than in the results of this study. Second, there may be errors due to fixing the period from symptom onset to diagnosis to 4 days and 2 days in the analysis. This is because the period between symptom onset and diagnosis showed a tendency to become shorter as the epidemic progressed, following the government's active preventive measures and the increased awareness of symptoms among the infected with a rapid increase in COVID-19 patients. However, due to individual differences, it could not be adjusted uniformly the period from symptom onset to diagnosis. In the future, a model that supplements the data on the symptoms and diagnosis dates for each individual is needed. Third, to simplify mathematical modeling, transmission during latency or asymptomatic infections were not taken into account, and it was assumed that the transmission of infection does not occur when patients are isolated. In addition, this model assumed that there was no inflow of infections from abroad, so it is possible that the number of infected patients is estimated to be smaller than it actually is, and there is a possibility that the epidemic will continue depending on the influx of infected cases from abroad. For the case of Daegu/NGP, assumption was also made that a massive group infection would not occur additionally in the future and the actual pattern of the epidemic may be different from the results of the model if a future largescale group infection occurs. Lastly, the model only includes Daegu/NGP and not the entire population in Korea. This study focused on Daegu/NGP as this region accounts for 90% of the current epidemic, but the pattern of the epidemic might be very different from those of other regions (Appendix 4). Thus, in the future, a detailed regional modelling based on the entire population of Korea should be added. In conclusion, the early stage epidemic in Korea was controlled at R= 0.5 for the initial 30 days with approximately 30 patients but the epidemic in Daegu/NGP starting with patient #31 appeared rapidly in large-scale with R = 3.5. However, the transmission period is becoming shorter with active COVID-19 testing by the quarantine authorities, and β is decreasing with active participation of the citizens in preventive measures such as wearing a mask and social distancing. In order to resume normal life by reducing the size of the epidemic and reducing the transmission period to minimize the number of patients, active participation in preventive activities on the part of the citizens is required in addition to continued efforts by the quarantine authorities. In particular, it is necessary to strictly control transmission in group facilities where vulnerable individuals are gathered to prevent local outbreaks. In addition, since the epidemic has spread throughout the world except for China, continued efforts are necessary to prevent the influx of new cases from abroad.

159000,"For the past month in the least, the universal community has closed borders with each other in an attempt to control the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. Quarantine and social distancing measures have been presented as an obligatory option that is being enforced by armed forces in Lebanon in order to avoid the flooding of the health care system. The results of this study showed that a noteworthy proportion of the participants have reported PTSD symptoms during quarantine, where the most reported symptoms were 'feeling distant or cut off from other people', 'feeling very upset when something reminded you of a stressful experience from the past', and 'repeated, disturbing memories, thoughts or images of a stressful experience from the past'. This proves a noteworthy psychological impact of quarantine among a considerable proportion of the Lebanese community. The number of symptomatic citizens increased substantially during the fourth week of quarantine, which proves a higher psychological influence of quarantine. This is consistent with a previous study where a proportion of Australian horse breeders quarantined for many weeks owing to an epidemic of equine flu recorded elevated psychological trauma during the epidemic. The symptomatic proportion relative to the Australian population was similar to that proportion relevant to the Lebanese citizens in our study (Taylor et al., 2008) . Our study did not show a significant difference between health care workers and non-health care workers regarding PTSD symptoms even though a higher mean of symptoms were recorded by health care providers and this can be explained by the fact that the quarantine is still in its second week, the sample is rather small, and that the health care system and the medical and nursing staff in Lebanon are receiving governmental and non-governmental support to fight COVID-19, in addition to the flexibility of those health care workers in leaving the hospitals to go home and are not on strict isolation or quarantine. A similar study was carried out among hospital staff workers who reported high depressive symptoms due to quarantine (Lee et al., 2018) . However, inconsistent with our findings, a previous study has shown that health care providers showed more severe symptoms of PTSD upon quarantine than the general public (Huremović, 2019). However, another study did agree with our findings and has shown that being a health care worker in quarantine was not associated with higher psychological symptoms (Hawryluck et al., 2004) . Thus supporting our results, a previous study (Hossain et al., 2020) also found similar results to our research, where it evaluated PTSD prevalence among children and parents who have been quarantined, and it revealed that a notable percentage of those who have abided by quarantine have shown symptoms that pertain of a PTSD diagnosis. Other descriptive studies addressing psychological distress among the quarantined population have shown a high rate of low mood and irritability (Lee et al., 2018) in addition to emotional disturbance, depression, and stress (Yoon et al., 2016) . A similar condition was reported during SARS (1) A little bit (2) Moderately (3) Quite a bit (4) Extremely ( (1) A little bit (2) Moderately (3) Quite a bit (4) Extremely ( (Brooks et al., 2020) . Not only quantitative studies have reported similar results to ours, but rather qualitative research have also indicated that psychological distress can result from quarantine practices such as confusion, fear, anger, grief, numbness and anxiety-induced insomnia (Caleo et al., 2018; Desclaux et al., 2017; Pellecchia et al., 2015) . In a previous research paper that has examined psychological responses during and after quarantine has shown comparable numbers of individuals reporting anxiety symptoms and feelings of anger, whereas 4-6 months after quarantine, these symptoms had diminished (Jeong et al., 2016) . Our results found that the respondents reported being alert and on guard all the time, and this was consistent with a previous study which found that due to SARS quarantine, a notable proportion of people tried to not get in contact with people coughing or sneezing, avoided crowds and stayed home even weeks after the quarantine was over, some even kept on obsessive hand hygiene (Reynolds et al., 2008) . The finding of this study examined certain characteristics such as age, gender, and quarantine practices to be predictive of PTSD symptoms, yet the result was negative. This was inconsistent with previous research (North et al., 2012 ) that has found that younger age and lower educational attainment were predictive of PTSD due to quarantine, while another study (Hawryluck et al., 2004) found that age was not associated with psychological distress, and this is consistent with our findings which can be explained that the majority of our sample were aged between 18 and 25 years. Upon the global outbreak of COVID-19, quarantine has become a necessity for survival and avoiding the coronavirus death toll to climb as a result of flooding the health care system, especially in Lebanon where until recently only 400 mechanical were functional thus limiting the number of critical COVID-19 cases to be accepted for treatment. On the contrary, Quarantine practices among the general public have started to give rise to psychological distress and specifically PTSD symptomatology among a notable proportion of the public which is suspected to augment in the coming days, especially now that the Lebanese people are abiding more and more by the home quarantine and social distancing upon the strict measures of the government.

159214,"At the time of writing, the COVID-19 pandemic has become a global crisis. Consequently, the negative psychological outcomes of the pandemic have become important to investigate. Therefore, in the present study, the relationships between intolerance of uncertainty, rumination, fear of COVID-19, and mental wellbeing were investigated. The findings indicated that rumination and fear of COVID-19 mediated the relationship between intolerance of uncertainty and mental wellbeing. As a result of the analysis, the hypothesis concerning the relationship between intolerance of uncertainty and wellbeing was confirmed. This result overlaps with findings indicating an increase in negative psychological consequences during epidemics (e.g., Jose et al. 2017; Mihashi et al. 2009; Yip et al. 2010) . Wellbeing is threatened by direct and indirect trauma as well as potential risk perception. Uncertainty may have also been triggered by disruption of daily routine and interaction social support mechanisms, as well as feelings concerning perceived loss of control. In accordance with another hypothesis, the mediating role of rumination in the relationship between intolerance of uncertainty and mental wellbeing was tested and the hypothesis was confirmed. The findings of the study indicated the mediating role of rumination in the relationship between intolerance of uncertainty and wellbeing concurs with research showing the moderating role of rumination in the relationship between daily activities and negative mood (Genet and Siemer 2012) . Similarly, intrusive rumination has been found to mediate in the relationship between traumatic experiences and posttraumatic disorder (Wozniak et al. 2020) . A study that examined the relationship between rumination and depressive mood showed that negative cognitions mediated this relationship (Ciesla and Roberts 2007) . Therefore, within the framework of all these empirical findings, it can be concluded that rumination increases negative cognition and bad mood as well as negative psychological wellbeing in traumatic and uncertain situations. The main hypothesis was confirmed because findings demonstrated the serial mediation roles of rumination and fear of COVID-19 in the relationship between intolerance of uncertainty and wellbeing. In line with this hypothesis, it was shown that rumination inflates COVID-19 fear and disrupts wellbeing. This finding is similar to findings that rumination in traumatic events may increase anger (Christ et al. 2020) , and speed up the recall of negative memories (Lyubomirsky et al. 1998) . Therefore, it can be speculated that rumination may increase fear in the COVID-19 pandemic because it increases negative affect in other traumatic situations. Overall, in the present study, it was shown with a nationwide participant sample that the inability to tolerate uncertainty in the current pandemic might provoke fear of COVID-19 via rumination, and consequently impacting negatively on psychological wellbeing. In line with these findings, counselors could develop programs to reduce intolerance to uncertainty and implement it online. In this context, the attachment-based intolerance to uncertainty reduction program in Turkey for adolescents has been developed and implemented (Yildiz and Iskender 2019) . Similar programs may be implemented in online settings, especially targeting risk groups. In addition, audio and visual materials in which internal dialogues with and without rumination are played can be prepared and shared by counselors. Moreover, to deal with uncertainty caused by pseudo-science and information, accurate and filtered knowledge about the COVID-19 pandemic can be shared with clients and the general community through social media channels. ","The findings indicated that rumination and fear of COVID-19 mediated the relationship between intolerance of uncertainty and mental wellbeing.<q>This result overlaps with findings indicating an increase in negative psychological consequences during epidemics (e.<q>At the time of writing, the COVID-19 pandemic has become a global crisis.

159314,"Our study presents some limitations mostly because of the shortness of time to organize the sampling. The arrival time of the flights was only known a few hours before landing. The experience of our team regarding point-of care testing helped in designing this study [9] . Quarantine of expatriates was decided by the French government as other European country governments. However, although sampling was not invasive (swabbing), our team proposed to give individuals the choice to get tested or not. Interestingly, the acceptability rate was excellent and the vast majority of individuals accepted to be tested (336 on the 337 individuals were tested at least once). In such situations, anxiety, often enhanced by the media, distorts how we think about new diseases, and when it comes to making decisions that involve risks, humans can be irrational in quite systematic ways [10] . Consequently, reducing anxiety through rapid diagnosis should improve decision making and crisis management. For example, since 5 February, more than 700 confirmed cases have been reported from the 3700 passengers on board the Diamond Princess cruise ship [11] . The anxiety on board and the difficulties in managing the quarantine are easy to imagine. Testing all passengers and crew after having diagnosed the index case and releasing SARS-Cov2 negative carriers from quarantine would likely have avoided supplementary cases. In outbreaks of disease, diagnosis and the time it takes is critical for patient management and establishing quarantine. Returning negative results to the individuals in question, the physician in charge, and decision makers is obviously important. Reducing the time scale to a matter of hours, which is now possible with molecular diagnosis, will provide us with a much easier way of managing crises. The remaining question is whether repeated negative test results are sufficient to shorten the quarantine period. In the future, such strategies could usefully applied to other viruses or bacteria for patients returning from overseas travel for symptomatic or asymptomatic individuals [12] .

159320,"In the autumn of 2019, the organizers of the 2020 Padua Muscle Days planned an intense program, which was to be held from March 18 to March 21, 2020. The program included eight Scientific Sessions to occur over three full days at either Padova University or the Hotel Augustus on Euganei Hills (Padova), Italy. Abruptly, however, in early January the Coronavirus COVID-19 outbreak started in China and changed the world perspectives and expectations. In Italy, it started in Lombardy and Veneto, two main industrial areas of the country with intense connections and interchanges of people and commercial activities with China. Indeed, the virus was first isolated from a couple of Chinese tourists, who inadvertently incubated the infection during their visit to many towns in Italy. Within the following two weeks, the epidemic had the first Italian cases and victims in an area south of Milan and in a Village of the Euganei Hills (Vo Euganeo, Padova). The village was immediately quarantined, but it was too late. The virus had escaped the area. Thus, it was a mandatory, though difficult decision (made even before the Italian National Government posted rules to be followed to decrease spread of the infection), to post-pone the Padua Muscle Days meeting from 18-21 March, 2020 to 25-28 November, 2020. Luckily, the vast majority of organizers, chairs, speakers, and attendees accepted the decision and have assured their presence in late November, despite the coincidence with the Thanksgiving holiday in the US. Currently, the only changes in the program are the new dates; however, it is difficult to forecast the future. Anyhow, the rationale of the decision to post-pone 2020PMD was reinforced by the actions of many organizers of international events. One of the most recent examples is the March 6, 2020 decision of the leaders of the Experimental Biology Host Societies to cancel Experimental Biology (EB) 2020, set to take place April 4–7 in San Diego, California, USA. All these active civil responses to world dangers are mandatory to avoid those military responses that are easy to start, but provide the worst results. How do we not lose half of the 2020 year? The option is to try to achieve some of the goals of the meeting by long-distance communications. Thus, the Collection of Abstracts will be, as originally planned, e-published in this 30(1) 2020 Issue of the European Journal of Translational Myology (EJTM) together with the many EJTM Communications submitted by speakers and attendees of the 2020PMD.

160594,"SARS-CoV-2 is a beta coronavirus, with enveloped positive sense ribonucleic acid, in family Coronaviridae, subgenus Sarbecovirus, and Orthocoronavirinae subfamily [2, 6] . It is the seventh coronavirus with human susceptibility [2, 3] . Coronaviruses generally attack the respiratory tract. Though most infections are mild, some like SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can lead to severe and potentially fatal infections. COVID-19 infections have been noted to be more common in men; these can range from mild to severe and are often related to underlying medical conditions of the host including hypertension, diabetes mellitus, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases [1, 2, 7] . Though SARS-CoV-2 was first traced to a seafood market in Wuhan, China, the source is not yet clear. Bats are considered natural reservoirs, and pangolins may also be involved [2, 6] . In retrospect, SARS-CoV had spread from palm civets and MERS-CoV from dromedary camels [2, 6] . It is now clear that SARS-CoV-2 attaches to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor in the respiratory epithelium to attach to and infect cells [1, 2] . It is very infectious with a low infective dose and can be transmitted by droplets, direct contact and via respiratory secretions and has also been isolated in fecal swabs. The incubation period varies from one to fourteen days with a median of three to seven days [2] . COVID-19 presentation may vary from a mild illness to pneumonia and even septic shock with acute respiratory distress syndrome [1, 2, 5, 7] . Cytokine storm due to excessive elaboration of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) and interleukins (IL)-2, IL-6, IL-7, and IL-10 has been seen [1, 2] . It commonly presents with fever (88%), cough (67.8%), fatigue (38.1%), sputum production (33.4%), dyspnea (18.6%), sore throat (13.9%), headache (13.6%) and sometimes even with vomiting (5%) and diarrhea (3.8%) [2] . Lymphopenia is common [1, 2] . CT of the thorax commonly reveals bilateral multilobar groundglass opacities with peripheral or posterior distribution, with consolidation seen more in the elderly [5, 8] . The radiological features peak around the 10th to 11th day of illness. Septal thickening, bronchiectasis, pleural thickening, subpleural involvement and cavitation are less common. Pleural and pericardial effusions are rare [8] . Diagnosis is generally performed from respiratory tract secretions via NAA testing as set forth by WHO, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and Infectious Disease Society of America guidelines [3, 7, 9] . In the absence of proven antivirals against SARS-CoV-2, treatment is generally symptomatic along with respiratory support. In patients with refractory hypoxemia, WHO has recommended the use of extra corporeal membrane oxygenation. Many drug trials are underway and a few have been promising [2, 3, 7, 9] . The first US patient was successfully treated with remdesivir [4] . Hydroxychloroquine has been shown to alter the pH of the cell membrane, thus interfering with viral fusion [2, 10] . It also inhibits viral nucleic acid replication, glycosylation of viral proteins, viral assembly and release [10] . Furthermore, it has immunomodulatory effects, suppressing TNF-α and IL-6 [2, 10] . The CDC has been guiding US healthcare providers on the care of COVID-19 patients. However, in the setting of a pandemic, it is of utmost importance to be able to sever the chain of transmission so that new cases can be reduced and allow the healthcare delivery system to catch up. COVID-19 has rapidly become a pandemic in only months due to the easy transmissibility of the SARS-CoV-2 virus aided by a huge number of mildly symptomatic patients. However, it is severe and life-threatening in older individuals and those with underlying conditions. With no proven treatment at present, the outcome is generally poor for such patients. Early diagnosis and self-isolation or quarantine remain key to stemming the tide of the contagion as there is a real risk of the healthcare system being overwhelmed by the sick population.

SUQC uses four variables and as few parameters as possible to avoid over-fitting the data, while adequately characterizes the epidemic dynamics. The model is different from the well-known epidemic SEIR model in the following aspects: (1) the infected individuals are classified into un-quarantined, quarantined and confirmed. And only the un-quanrantined can infect the susceptible individuals; While in SEIR, all the infected are infectious; (2) the quarantine rate is a parameter in SUQC to explicitly model the effects of quarantine and control measures; (3) SUQC distinguishes the confirmed infected individuals (observed data) and the total infected individuals, and the parameter confirmation rate is affected by medical resources and the sensitivity of diagnosis methods. Overall, SUQC is developed to characterize the dynamics of COVID-19, and is more suitable for analysis and prediction than adopting existing epidemic models. However, we should emphasize that the estimates of SUQC are from a deterministic ODE model without confidence intervals, and the uncertainty from various sources will be taken into account in future study. SUQC is applied to the daily released data of China to analyze the dynamics of COVID-19 outbreak, and demonstrates an accurate prediction of the trends with the test data. COVID-19 has currently spread to more than 30 countries. Some countries, such as, South Korea, Japan, Italy and Iran are in their early stage of an outbreak, and the governments are attempting to minimize further spread. SUQC can serve as a useful tool for quantifying parameters and variables concerning the effects of quarantine or confirmation methods on the epidemic, and further provide guidance on the control of the outbreak in these countries.

161651,"The emergence of COVID-19, the SARS-CoV-2-associated pneumonia, poses a global threat and challenges to communities as well as healthcare systems. In response to this unprecedented outbreak, which has already produced a higher number of infected cases and mortality within the first 6 weeks of its declaration than the entire outbreak of SARS-CoV in 2003, 2,3 a rapid infection control response is essential to contain and mitigate the risk of nosocomial transmission and outbreak. In the SARS-CoV outbreak, almost 60% of nosocomial acquisition of SARS-CoV occurred among HCWs 4 ; therefore, it is critically important to implement proactive infection control measures among HCWs, and these measures must be planned in advance. In Hong Kong, a cosmopolitan city of 1,104 km 2 with a population of 7.45 million in southern China, we are at a high risk of importation of infected cases from mainland China. Therefore, we progressively stepped up our infection control measures by widening the clinical and epidemiological criteria of surveillance for early recognition and isolation of index cases according to the evolution of the epidemic. In particular, having visited a hospital in mainland China was introduced as an epidemiological criterion for surveillance on day 17 of our infection control preparedness measures, even though COVID-19 was confined to Wuhan, Hubei Province, until day 20. 2 The criteria of previous hospital visit was included because it had previously been determined to be a risk factor for SARS acquisition in China. 14 Under the surveillance program, of 42 cases of COVID-19 were identified in Hong Kong, 36 were immediately isolated in AIIR upon admission. During the SARS outbreak, the median time between index patient admission and patient isolation was 4.5 days (1-13 days), according to a review of literature. 4 At the same time, we enhanced the infection control measures by implementing standard, contact, droplet, and airborne precautions for suspected or confirmed cases. We stepped up the use of PPE among HCWs performing aerosol-generating procedures (AGPs), even when caring for patients without clinical features and epidemiological exposure risk in the general wards. Performance of AGPs such as endotracheal intubation, open suctioning, and use of high-flow oxygen was a risk factor for nosocomial transmission of SARS-CoV among HCWs. 15 In addition, provision of surgical masks to all HCWs, patients, and visitors in clinical areas was implemented on day 5. Although wearing a surgical mask alone was not clearly associated with protection from acquisition of SARS-CoV, wearing a surgical mask by either HCWs or patients reduces the risk of nosocomial transmission of pandemic influenza. 16, 17 The combination of hand hygiene with face masks shows statistically significant efficacy against laboratory-confirmed influenza in the community, as illustrated in a systematic review and meta-analysis. 18 Hand hygiene among HCWs and patients was promoted and enforced during the COVID-19 epidemic. 19, 20 With this bundle of infection prevention measures, we were able to maintain zero nosocomial transmission of SARS-CoV-2 after the importation of first confirmed case on day 22 in Hong Kong. The mode of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 will undoubtedly be investigated further. Opportunistic airborne transmission was implicated in SARS-CoV. 21 The World Health Organization recommends the use of airborne precautions whenever applicable in addition to standard, contact, and droplet precautions. 22 To investigate this connection, we conducted a pilot experiment to examine the exhaled air of a confirmed patient with a moderate level of viral load in respiratory specimens, with or without wearing a surgical mask in the AIIR. Notably, the RNA of SARS-CoV-2 was undetectable in the air samples but was present in an environmental sample. We cannot make a definite conclusion based on the analysis of a single patient; however, our finding may help to reassure our staff that exhaled air may be rapidly diluted inside an AIIR with 12 air exchanges per hour, or that the SARS-CoV-2 may not be predominantly transmitted by airborne route. The presence of environmental contamination by SARS-CoV-2 highlights the importance of transmission via direct or indirect contact. SARS-CoV retained its viability on a smooth surface for >5 days at temperatures of 22-25°C and relative humidity of 40%-50%. 23 Transmission within families remained a concern because 66% of confirmed cases diagnosed in Hong Kong were spread among family members. One family cluster comprised 11 cases, most probably caused by viral transmission during their gathering for hot pot, in which the use of utensils and chopsticks contaminated by saliva may occur. Saliva was shown to be positive for SARS-CoV-2 in 11 of 12 patients at a median of 3.3 × 10 6 copies per mL at the time of presentation. 24 In this family cluster, an asymptomatic patient was retrospectively diagnosed, a 91-year-old lady. Along with our recent report of an asymptomatic case in a pediatric patient, 25 we observe that asymptomatic infection can occur over a wide age range. The transmissibility of infection among asymptomatic patients deserves further investigation. With the implementation of active and enhanced surveillance with progressively wider screening criteria during the evolution of this epidemic, we have recognized most of the confirmed cases upon hospitalization, and we have achieved zero nosocomial transmission in HCWs and patients within the first 6 weeks. However, our surveillance program may be challenged by patients with mild symptoms. In early publications, fever and cough were reported in 87% and 80% of patients, respectively, at the time of presentation. 1, [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] With the presence of a locally acquired case, epidemiological criteria may no longer be useful for admission screening. Vigilance in hand hygiene practice, wearing of surgical masks in the hospital, and appropriate use of PPE in patient care, especially performing AGPs, are the key infection control measures to prevent nosocomial transmission of SARS-CoV-2, even before the availability of effective antiviral agents and vaccine.

161691,"We characterised the distribution of incubation periods for travellers from Wuhan infected with 2019-nCoV in Wuhan who were reported as cases between 20 and 28 January 2020. The study provides empirical evidence to back reports on a familial cluster where five family members developed symptoms 3 to 6 days after exposure [10] , and fits within the range for the incubation period of 0 to 14 days assumed by the WHO and of 2 to 12 days assumed by the ECDC [11] . Our estimate of the mean incubation period is longer than the value of 5.2 days based on 10 cases [12] , and 4.8 days (range: 2-11) based on 16 travellers between Wuhan and Guangdong [13] . The latter study is restricted to travellers with a 3-day exposure window. Repeating our analysis with only the 25 visitors to Wuhan who had a closed exposure window, leads to a mean incubation period of 4.5 days (CI: 3.7-5.6) which is more in line with the studies above, but the 95th percentile drops to 8.0 days (CI: 6.3-11.8). In our analysis, we assumed a uniform prior probability of being infected during the period of stay in Wuhan. Since the epidemic was developing during that time period, it is more likely that travellers were infected towards the end rather than the beginning of their stay. This might produce a slight bias towards longer incubation periods, so the estimated upper limit of 11.1 days could be considered conservative. The travellers in this study represent a selective sample of the reported cases. We found travellers to be more often male and younger than the cases reported in [12] . The numbers are too small to detect systematic differences in incubation time with age or sex. Because we only have information on confirmed cases, there is likely a bias towards more severe cases in areas with early awareness and a well-functioning healthcare system. As the epidemic continues, it remains important to collect more information on the incubation periods of 2019-nCoV cases with older ages, with underlying morbidity, who are women or who have mild symptoms. There are various choices one can make about the parametric form of the incubation period distribution. The results with the three often-used forms we report here suggest that there is little impact on the mean and dispersion of the incubation periods. Of these three, the lognormal distribution assigns higher probabilities to longer incubation periods. Although we found that this distribution provided a poorer description of the data than the Weibull and the gamma distributions, it is prudent not to dismiss the possibility of incubation periods up to 14 days at this stage of the epidemic.

162551,"This paper examines the transmission dynamics of the coronavirus disease 2019 in China, considering both within-and between-city transmissions. Our sample is from January 19 to February 29 and covers key episodes such as the initial spread of the virus across China, the peak of infections in terms of domestic case counts, and the gradual containment of the virus in China. Changes in weather conditions induce exogenous variations in past infection rates, which allow us to identify the causal impact of past infections on new cases. The estimates suggest that the infectious effect of the existing cases is mostly observed within 1 week and people's responses can break the chain of infections. Comparing estimates in two sub-samples, we observe that the spread of COVID-19 has been effectively contained by mid February, especially for cities outside Hubei province. Data on real-time population flows between cities have become available in recent years. We show that this new source of data is valuable in explaining between-city transmissions of COVID-19, even after controlling for traditional measures of geographic and economic proximity. By April 5 of 2020, COVID-19 infections have been reported in more than 200 countries or territories and more than 64,700 people have died. Behind the grim statistics, more and more national and local governments are implementing countermeasures. Cross border travel restrictions are imposed in order to reduce the risk of case importation. In areas with risks of community transmissions, public health measures such as social distancing, mandatory quarantine, and city lockdown are implemented. In a series of counterfactual simulations, we find that based on the experience in China, preventing sustained community transmissions from taking hold in the first place has the largest impact, followed by restricting population flows from areas with high risks of infections. Local public health measures such as closed management of communities and family outdoor restrictions can further reduce the number of infections. A key limitation of the paper is that we are not able to disentangle the effects from each of the stringent measures taken, as within this 6-week sampling period, China enforced such a large number of densely timed policies to contain the virus spreading, often simultaneously in many cities. A second limitation is that shortly after the starting date of the official data release for confirmed infected cases throughout China, i.e., January 19, 2020, many stringent measures were implemented, which prevents researchers to compare the post treatment sub-sample with a pre treatment subsample during which no strict policies were enforced. Key knowledge gaps remain in the understanding of the epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19, such as individual risk factors for contracting the virus and infections from asymptotic cases. Data on the demographics and exposure history for those who have shown symptoms as well as those who have not will help facilitate these research. adjustment in COVID-19 case definitions in Hubei province in February.

162782,"Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus Type 2 (SARS-CoV-2) affects people at all ages and it may be encountered in pregnant women and newborns also. The information about its clinical features, laboratory findings and prognosis in children and newborns is scarce. All the reported cases in pregnant women were in the 2nd or 3rd trimester and only 1% of them developed severe disease. Miscarriages are rare. Materno-fetal transmission of the disease is controversial. Definitive diagnosis can be made by a history of contact with a proven case, fever, pneumonia and gastrointestinal disorder and a Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test of nasopharyngeal swabs. Lymphopenia as well as liver and renal dysfunctions may be seen. Suspected or proven cases of newborns with symptoms should be quarantined in the neonatal intensive care unit for at least 14 days with standart and droplet isolation precautions. Asymptomatic infants may be quaratined at home. Transport of the neonates should be performed in a dedicated transport incubator and ambulance with isolation precautions. There is no specific treatment for the disease, but hemodynamic stabilization of the infant, respiratory management and other daily care are essential. Drugs against cytokine storm syndrome such as corticosteroids or tocilizumab are under investigation. Routine antibiotics are not recommended. No deaths have been reported so far in the neonatal population. Families and healthcare staff should receive pyschological support.

162986,"The virus has overtaken the burden of morbidity and mortality around the world for its quick and efficient spreading nature [1] . The spectrum of this disease ranges from mild to severe, even life-threatening consequences. Some cases might progress rapidly to acute respiratory distress syndrome [5] and/or multiple organ function failure [6] . This case highlights that COVID-19 cannot be ruled out by the absence of respiratory symptoms in patients with significant travel or exposure history. In this case, RNA tests were negative at the first time. Moreover, no research has yet been accurately established in the contagious period of COVID-19. Besides, patients in convalescence as well as asymptomatic carriers may also be infectious. SARS-CoV-2 RNA from respiratory tract specimens may be persistent or recurrently positive during the course of the disease. Furthermore, Angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE-2), identified as the cell entry receptor of SARS-CoV-2, was highly expressed in the lungs rather than in the upper respiratory tract [7, 8] . The result of the SARS-CoV-2 RNA test more likely depends on the viral load of the specimen. Hence, there are chances of false negatives on occasion for oropharyngeal or nasopharyngeal swabs tests, affected by-the site from where the sample was taken, the experience of the operator, and the actual quantity of virus. In that case, the Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) specimen test can be considered for more accuracy with a consideration of higher exposure risk. In addition to the above specimens, SARS-CoV-2 RNA can be detected in a patient's sputum or stool swab by RT-PCR assay and blood for antibody test [9] . Combination with the SARS-CoV-2 RNA test and other detective methods such as a specific antigen, IgM antibody, or the next-generation sequencing, may also conducive to diagnosis. Patients as an asymptomatic carrier may also be infectious.

Fig 6 shows the trend of the cumulative forwarding population with the participation of opinion leaders, where the orange line denotes the  In this paper, we propose an opinion-leader susceptible-forwarding-immune (OL-SFI) dynamics model based on the forwarding quantities generated by opinion leaders and normal users in different stages from the Chinese Sina-microblog during the outbreak of COVID-19. For there are always many opinion leaders with an enormous fan base in a real-world, investigating the propagation mechanism with the influence of opinion leaders is extraordinarily necessary and significant. We take the great driving power of the opinion leaders in the information propagation process into consideration while studying the spreading dynamics of the information within the interference of different numbers of opinion leaders at each active period. The role of our model is to examine how opinion leaders have influenced public opinion and information propagation in different stages when the outbreak unfolds. We have performed the data fitting based on the real data related to COVID-19 obtained from Chinese Sina-microblog to verify the effectiveness of our model. Based on the results of numerical simulations and sensitivity analysis at different stages, we can use the rules of evolution with regard to characteristic indexes of public opinion to formulate effective interventions for opinion leaders to participate in the public opinion. To a large extent, the average inactive rate α in this model is determined by the general public's character and their interest, so it is more difficult to be controlled. However, we can have an insight into the hidden crisis behind the public opinion by putting average exposure rates and forwarding probabilities into a realtime update strategy. More significantly, the index < o which is calculated from actual data can be used to derive the thresholds of p N and β N utilizing a contrary thinking, so that we could simulate the earlier brewing process of public opinion, and notify the relevant departments to make plans of facing the emergency before the outbreak of public opinion. On the other hand, for some positive information, we are supposed to encourage opinion leaders to forward it several times in order to increase the forwarding probability p L and average exposure rate β L . Meanwhile, it can be inferred from the estimation results of cumulative forwarding quantity that the best time and the appropriate number of opinion leaders for the intervention in different stages. Consequently, we are able to use the ""Golden Stage"" to maximize the positive influence of those opinion leaders. As for some bad information, we need to reduce the exposure rate of normal users β N avoiding more people to read such information, and at the same time α N could be increased. In this way, it is more conducive to creating a good direction for the development of public opinion and avoiding sharpening conflicts between different kinds of people. Furthermore, it is vital to pay attention to C 1 by ng real-time detection of its tendency combined with the results of PRCC analysis. If we perceive that some pieces of harmful information have entered the situation where the public opinion is well prepared to break out, β N and p N should be declined as soon as possible. Simultaneously, it is necessary to stop the participation of opinion leaders by preventing p L increasing successively to make the number of susceptible users S 0 decrease, so as to avoid the harmful public opinion to become a more severe deterioration. In a word, the propagation scale can be gradually promoted with the participation of opinion leaders, and their entering time will control the forwarding lifeline. That is, the earlier opinion leaders get into the intervention, the greater their influence will be. Our focus here is to make use of our OL-SFI dynamics model to help original post owners design effective communication strategies for the on-going battle against COVID-19 and future pandemic outbreaks in terms of public opinion and information dissemination.

163362,"The ongoing COVID-19 outbreak has rapidly evolved and spread globally [15] . Epidemiological studies suggest that SARS-CoV-2 has an intrinsic capacity to cause epidemic spread [16] . SARS-CoV-2 appears to be highly transmissible from human-to-human resulting in a wide spectrum of clinical manifestations in patients with COVID-19 [15] . However, similar to our investigation, increasing evidence suggests that mild clinical symptoms could be more frequent in cases of COVID-19. In our investigation, amongst nine cases, one had severe symptoms, seven had mild symptoms and one was asymptomatic. Although the Huanan market in Wuhan was highly relevant to the emergence and spread of COVID-19, and the SARS-CoV-2 has been detected in environmental samples obtained from the market, the origin of this virus has been determined conclusively [17] . Currently, there is no confirmed animal reservoir of the virus, but the available evidence strongly supports that the SARS-CoV-2 was derived from bats [7, 18] . However, it is not yet clear whether SARS-CoV-2 infected humans via direct transmission from a bat or through an intermediate host [17] .

163374,"This case series of the Bavarian cluster constitutes the first documented chain of multiple humantohuman transmissions of SARSCoV2 outside of Asia. Due to the particular setting centred around a business company with encounters tractable through electronic calendars, the timing and setting of most contact events were well defined. The sensitising and close monitoring of people involved might have triggered sensitive reporting of prodromal symptoms. This might explain a rather short median incubation period of 4·0 days in our study, which is substantially shorter than the 5·2 days calculated from data of the first 425 confirmed cases in China 11 but similar to the findings of Guan and colleagues. 12 For comparison, the incubation period for SARS was 6·4 days, with a range of 1-14 days. 13 The short incubation period combined with a median serial interval of the same length correspond to transmission early in the course of disease, or even before disease onset, which is corroborated by studies of viral shedding in the same patients. 8 Highlevel replication with frequent virus isolation from the pharynx stands by contrast with the SARS coronavirusgenetically similar to SARSCoV2-that was shed at lower concentrations from the upper respiratory tract and was effectively transmitted roughly a week after symptom onset. 11 This delayed shedding in SARS caused substantial problems with the sensitivity of RTPCR based on upper respiratory tract swabs. In our study, two tests from patient 11 came back negative although the patient had already developed symptoms, suggesting that these results were false negative. Nevertheless, it is evident from our study that RTPCR on throat swabs can discover asymptomatic or oligosymptomatic people who shed the virus. The present investigation enables us to determine secondary attack rates based on closely monitored high risk contacts. The secondary attack rate thereby decreases with the intensity of contact: among members of the cohorted household, the secondary attack rate was 75%, but decreased to 10% among household contacts that were only together until isolation of the case. Although the experience with the cohorted family is based on a single observation, it shows the high risk of close household contacts-ie, sharing a room-of a case in home isolation and calls for strong measures within households to prevent transmission, particularly if susceptible people are present. Among 217 non household highrisk contacts that were cumulatively followed up because of direct contact with a confirmed case, 11 were infected. The resulting secondary attack rate of 5% seems low, indicating little spread in this cluster. However, more effective spread of the virus might have been prevented by the proactive quarantine of highrisk contacts later identified as cases while still being presymptomatic or mildly symptomatic, as well as the proactive closure of the affected company. Trans mission originating from people with more distinct respiratory symptoms might have resulted in a higher number of secondary cases. Although two patients developed signs of pneumonia later in the course of disease, all others had a light course of disease and all patients recovered fully. 8 However, it should be taken into account that the outbreak occurred in a population of workingage, generally healthy individuals. The overall clinical picture might have been different in a population including older individuals, or those with underlying chronic diseases. Another limitation of our study is that, naturally, not all infectious encounters could be reconstructed. Because the company held larger business and social events during the exposure period, it is possible that an infectious case might have met a successor case so briefly that neither of the two remembered the encounter. Some transmission events were nevertheless confirmed by viral sequencing and popu lation analysis. The contact investigation and interviews followed a general hypothesis of direct humantohuman transmission, and we believe that the con curring epidemiological and genetic results in recon structing the transmission network support this assumption. In conclusion, while COVID19 cases presented partially with mild, nonspecific symptoms in the Bavarian outbreak studied here, we found that infectiousness before symptom onset, on the day of symptom onset, and during mild prodromal symptoms was substantial and poses a huge challenge on the implementation of public health measures. Additionally, the incubation period was often very short and false negative tests can occur. Thus, although the outbreak was controlled and therefore might have granted valuable time before more intense transmission occurred in Germany, successful longterm and global containment of COVID19 could be difficult to achieve.

163502,"COVID-19 pandemic resulted in a dramatic disruption of global supply chains and resulted in temporary, but acute shortage of PPE in high demand for both medical staff in hospitals and personnel of public services (shopping centers, banks, delivery and social services, including volunteers), and ultimately for ordinary citizens. A spike demand increase by hundreds of thousands to millions of pieces is difficult to satisfy merely through existing industrial facilities; despite being potentially capable of mass production, the short supply of raw materials and semi-finished products in combination with manpower quarantined at home leads to critical underperformance of the existing mechanisms. University fabrication laboratories and various workshops frequently equipped with CAD/CAM tools (laser cutters, 3D-printers, robotic centers) with relatively low load under ""normal"" operation fall into a unique category of spare, configurable resources that can be mobilized quickly and efficiently, provided a number of key methods and approaches are adopted. Their productivity can be built-up speedily to convert them into fast mass-production facilities. Special organizational measures, however, need to be taken, e.g., to minimize the presence and interaction of workers within laboratories, out-sourcing simple hand operations to volunteers, etc. Additional productivity increase can be obtained if some operations are distributed between several university workshops. Activities of this kind became omnipresent and widespread during the COVID-19 lockdown period in many countries worldwide, and the first reports appeared in scientific literature [11, 12] . These reports both encourage other operators and also highlight the need for optimization by means of (a) material cost reduction via appropriate materials selection, layout and design; (b) tool cost reduction due to maximal use of existing equipment; and (c) labor cost reduction via the use of volunteers. We present and analyze a successful case of fast mass-production (up to 5000 items per day) of light transparent medical safety face shields in Skoltech's Fablab. The purpose of our report is to share experience and attract attention of other university fabrication laboratories and workshops to issues of material selection, variant design, tooling, productivity optimization, and sustained decontamination. We believe that the principal findings reported here are widely applicable and adaptable to local conditions. The following are concise key points: i. Die-free cutting (direct digital fabrication) is preferred for speedy build-up of production; ii. Simplest design with 1-3 parts and manual assembly is recommended (we recommend one or two part designs without elastic bands for short-time usage only); iii. Relatively thin sheet (0.3-0.5 mm) of PET provides satisfactory rigidity; iv. 2-3 working shifts are recommended per working day, with a separate space for each shift to mitigate the risk of cross-contamination and to allow disinfection and cleaning; v. Delivery and assembly can be best left to volunteers and/or end-users (20% of assembled kits and 80% of ready-to-assemble kits in one package); vi. Sustained disinfection can be ensured by shipping products in sealed transport bags (which is difficult with assembled items). COVID-19 pandemic dramatically challenges society to find technical solutions for fast mass production of low-cost personal safety means to protect medical personnel and ordinary citizens. In the situation when material sources are limited by the restrictions on trading and transportation and manpower is quarantined, these technical solutions must rely on the designs suggesting the simplest tools operated by a minimal number of operators. CAM technology realized as the cutting of sheet materials by means of widely available university workshops and fabrication laboratories is viewed as optimal for fast mass production of parts to be assembled by a community of volunteers or end users at site. ","COVID-19 pandemic resulted in a dramatic disruption of global supply chains and resulted in temporary, but acute shortage of PPE in high demand for both medical staff in hospitals and personnel of public services (shopping centers, banks, delivery and social services, including volunteers), and ultimately for ordinary citizens.<q>A spike demand increase by hundreds of thousands to millions of pieces is difficult to satisfy merely through existing industrial facilities; despite being potentially capable of mass production, the short supply of raw materials and semi-finished products in combination with manpower quarantined at home leads to critical underperformance of the existing mechanisms.<q>Their productivity can be built-up speedily to convert them into fast mass-production facilities.

163545,"We found similar estimates of reproducibility number and the proportion of the Spanish population contaminated by the new coronavirus, whether they were estimated from hospitalization numbers or detected cases. Both estimates from case reports and hospitalizations suggest that only mandatory quarantine achieved R0 lower than 1, while R0 during state of emergency before nonessential services were shut down was estimated to be well beyond 1. This predicts that the opening of the non-essential services by April 13 may lead to a new surge of cases. Based on this empirical study, mandatory confinement is the only state-wise measure that effectively reduces the number of contaminations. Estimates based on death reports differed considerably from those based on either hospitalizations or detected cases. This suggests that some of the assumptions and data our modeling is based on may not be accurate (although commonly used in previous studies), and shows that this can induce very large biases in the estimation of the propagation of the new coronavirus in Spain. A crucial pre-requisite for the reliability of our estimates is that the proportion of events do not vary in time. That was likely not the case neither for detected cases, as the testing policy evolved during the period of study, nor for deaths, as the saturation of health systems may have led to higher death tolls and reporting of deaths in retirement homes evolved. As the proportion of hospitalized cases is believed to be more stable across time, we believe that estimates based on the latter are more reliable than estimates based on either reported cases or deaths. Below, we further comment on the results obtained with the hospitalization reports. Our approach is similar to a study by an Imperial College team published last week inferring the infecting depends on the days from infection. 10 Nor do it take into account mobility between regions, whose impact is believed to be more important at the initiation of the epidemics. It is also worth noting that in a locked down environment where most contacts are compartmentalized in households, it is possible that at beginning the virus continues to spread rapidly within households, but less so between households. As immunity was not taken care here, 0 may J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f decrease significantly more without further policies, after this first wave of within-household contamination is over. Finally, we only modeled the impact of lockdown, not of other measures which were taken too close apart (banning public events, closing schools, etc.), and simultaneously in most regions, so it is not possible here to disentangle their effects precisely. The analysis also did not take into account other changes that have occurred during this period, such as measures at an individual level or at the level of companies and local institutions (usage of masks, hands washing, etc.). In conclusion, the greatest interest should be focused on the trends in R0 found in this work, which show drastic successive reductions after the implementation of the state of urgency and forced quarantines.

163617,"As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to spread to new countries, some aspects pertaining to the patient's presentation, interventions to provide patient care, and the country's measures of containment in response to this first case in Bhutan may be of broad interest. The patient's initial presenting symptoms were gastrointestinal; he subsequently developed a cough. Although early studies suggested that gastrointestinal symptoms were uncommon with COVID-19, subsequent studies have suggested that such symptoms are more common, noted in 10% and 18.6% in two studies. [4] [5] [6] The patient's lack of appetite prompted him to seek medical care. In a recent study, 78.6% of COVID-19 patients suffered from a lack of appetite at presentation. 6 The patient's presentation did not fall into the case definition for COVID-19 that Bhutan was using at that time, which was limited to fever and respiratory symptoms. This case is a reminder of atypical presentations and the need for allowing medical providers' clinical discretion in management and for regular updating of case definitions during a new disease outbreak. As the patient's clinical status worsened, it seemed possible that this may have been due to an aberrant immune response, which is described in patients with viral infections, leading to ARDS. 2, 7 Prior case reports of IVIG successfully treating ARDS secondary to viral illnesses have been documented. 1,2 After receiving IVIG, the patient had dramatic improvement of oxygenation and a downward trend in his inflammatory markers. Although the efficacy of IVIG, timing, dosage, and patient selection all clearly require further study, this case suggests that a trial of IVIG for the treatment of COVID-19 is warranted. The public health strategies initiated by Bhutan's Ministry of Health and government are beyond the scope of this case report, but the immediate steps pertaining to the patient's contacts and medical staff caring for the patient are of interest. Some relevant lessons from Singapore and Hong Kong, which were able to curtail the rapid spread of the virus fairly effectively, include the need for the following: 1) appropriate personal protective equipment for medical staff in contact with a suspected patient, 2) disinfecting surfaces, 3) treating patients in a separate ward or hospital with a separate team, and 4) contact tracing and quarantine. 8, 9 In Singapore, contact tracing accounted for the primary detection of approximately half of the country's first 100 COVID-19 patients. 8 Despite the patient's atypical presentation, Bhutan's preparedness played a role in limiting exposure and making the initial diagnosis. The triage nurse, trained to screen patients for recent travel, alerted the emergency physician, who then took the patient to a predesignated isolation area for suspected cases. After the patient tested positive, a decision was rapidly made to designate a separate hospital building as a dedicated COVID-19 hospital. Separate staff including doctors, nurses, ambulance drivers, and cleaners were designated for this facility. These staff lived in a separate facility for the duration of treating the patient, after which they were put in a 14-day quarantine and monitored for symptoms. All of the patient's contacts were traced and quarantined. Those with exposures deemed high risk were tested initially and at the end of their 14 days of quarantine. Although this is not common practice globally, it led to the diagnosis of COVID-19 infection in the patient's partner, who was asymptomatic. No other initial contacts or medical staff tested positive by the end of their 14day quarantine. To prevent the import of cases and subsequent local transmission from occurring, Bhutan rapidly initiated travel restrictions barring the entry of all nonnationals and instituted a mandatory quarantine in designated hotels for all persons entering Bhutan. To date, there have been five cases of COVID-19; the three additional cases were diagnosed among repatriated quarantined Bhutanese students who were studying abroad. There has been no evidence of local community spread.

163776,"Quarantines are often implemented at ports as border measures against infectious diseases. The isolation of ship passengers and crew members during a 30-to 40-day incubation period was effective to protect against a plague pandemic in 1337. 1 Therefore, confinement to a ship such as the Diamond Princess has become a standard approach in terms of quarantine. However, ships are increasing in size and carrying more passengers and crew members. Therefore, some changes in terms of quarantine were required. For example, substantial resources were needed to conduct testing on all 3711 people. A previous study on the management of a ship with an outbreak of influenza virus suggested that outbreaks of infectious disease spread easily on a ship. 2 However, it was impossible to prepare private isolation rooms for all 3711 individuals on mainland Japan; thus, the passengers and crew members had to be quarantined on the ship. This strategy was considered effective to protect mainland Japan from the spread of SARS-CoV-2. 3 Therefore, appropriate screening and patient transport are important to control the spread of infectious diseases. Allowing a ship with a large number of infected patients to dock can be an unmanageable burden for local regions where a port is located. A sudden increase in medical needs can be described as a ""disaster."" Selecting host hospitals, conducting medical checks on passengers, and managing transport are urgent issues. The Japan DMAT was optimal for managing this situation, as it often manages such tasks after a natural disaster. 4, 5 These disaster experiences were useful for managing the issue concerning the Diamond Princess. For example, the Japan DMAT categorized the patients to determine priorities smoothly. On the other hand, the method of patient transport was different than usual. Usually, aircraft transportation is selected for such long distances. As a countermeasure against a future expected Nankai Trough earthquake, which would cause extensive damage, a wide-area medical transportation plan using aircraft from the JSDF has been prepared. 6, 7 In addition, doctor helicopters that carry doctors and nurses are available in Japan. 8, 9 However, helicopters were not permitted to transport infected patients in this case because adequate protection could not be secured. Therefore, all patients with COVID-19 were transferred by land. Critical care and emergency medical centers in Yokohama accepted the patients with or without COVID-19 who had been aboard the ship and required immediate emergency treatment. However, providing medical care with proper protection is challenging. Managing infectious patients consumes more time and resources. Therefore, it was impossible to treat patients without COVID-19 as usual. 10 Recently, cruise ships have become increasingly bigger and started carrying more passengers. The docking of such large ships when carrying some passengers with an infectious disease has the risk of overwhelming regional medical care systems. Therefore, measures to manage such situations properly should be prepared. Regarding this case, medical and transport management skills were needed to assess the urgency of patients and identify proper host hospitals. DMAT initiated operations on the ship, devised and implemented a triage system for transport, and facilitated transport throughout a local and regional network of hospitals, while dealing with challenges in logistics, hospital capacity, and isolation protocols.

164382,"During the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, we have faced unprecedented challenges in the delivery of surgical education. At the time of writing, changes to the structure and nature of the surgical workforce are occurring rapidly, even daily. Surgical educators are utilizing remote learning solutions, including flipped classroom approaches, online educational materials, telemedicine, and simulations, to continue education for surgical residents despite cancelations of face-to-face instruction. Universal Design for Learning (UDL) provides a framework that can be used to situate such solutions within the broader view of strategic inclusive instructional design that aims to meet diverse learning needs. The principles of UDL can inform curricular and pedagogical changes in surgical education that may be employed during a time of social distancing, isolation, and quarantine. UDL involves planning flexibility into curricular design from the outset, recognizing that learners are varied in their learning preferences and capabilities, motivational characteristics, and environmental constraints. Viewing the design of remote learning opportunities through the UDL lens aims to remove barriers to learning during this pandemic by targeting three areas – expansion of the means that information is communicated, ways that learners are supported and motivated, and approaches to assessing learning through available distance learning technologies.","During the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, we have faced unprecedented challenges in the delivery of surgical education.<q>Universal Design for Learning (UDL) provides a framework that can be used to situate such solutions within the broader view of strategic inclusive instructional design that aims to meet diverse learning needs.<q>At the time of writing, changes to the structure and nature of the surgical workforce are occurring rapidly, even daily.

164416,"The individual and social assessment of the COVID-19 vaccine is key to defining prevention strategies, and allows visualizing the perceived benefit of the investment that research laboratories could have if they develop a vaccine, which is important considering the current global R&D activity focused on creating one [1] . This study shows that there is a high individual WTP, with an average of US$184.72 under the most accurate estimation technique and with a reliability level of 99.9%. These results are similar in magnitude to those found by [7] for the meningococcal B vaccine (US$189.24 = AU295) in Australia. However, the values are higher than those found in other studies conducted with other serious diseases with risk of death [3, 4, 6] . Specifically, the evaluation of the COVID-19 vaccine was far superior to that of the Hepatitis B vaccine in Malaysia (US$73 [4] ), Zika in Brazil (US$ 31.34 [17] ), Dengue in Malaysia (US$28.36 [6] ) and Ebola in Indonesia (US$2.08 [3] ). This are upper/middle-income economies, except for Malaysia, which is a low/middle-income country [10] -Thus, the high economic valuation of the COVID-19 vaccine could be explained because SARS-CoV-2 has had a higher contagion rate, has spread more rapidly and has affected all countries in the world [18] . The country's high per capita income is also a contributing factor. In fact, we found a relatively high vaccine acceptance rate (90.6%), considering that other studies have found acceptance ranges that go from 37.5% to 88.4% [3, 4, 6] . On the one hand, there could be a tendency in individuals to accept a payment or to say ""yes"" when they have less-formed preferences, which according to [19] tends to occur with health-related goods and services. This could also explain the high approval rate with the payment vector thresholds presented. On the other hand, it could also be that individuals foresee a high risk of getting sick (99.1%) and therefore would be more willing to pay, which has already been pointed out by other studies [6] . This, especially considering that COVID-19 could be perceived as ""catastrophic"" due to the health costs and the increased risk of death of vulnerable people (older adults and people with pre-existing chronic diseases), according to the results of [20, 21] ; in addition to the high social and economic cost of this disease [1] . Furthermore, we precisely demonstrated that one of the main variables that determine the WTP is the pre-existence of chronic diseases, the level of knowledge of COVID-19 and having COVID-19. Thus, both the high approval rate for the vaccine (90.1%) and the belief that one will eventually get sick (99.1%) demonstrate a positive intention of individuals towards it, even without knowing the details of its real effects on health. This is an important argument against the so-called ""vacillation"" which, according to [22] , becomes a rejection of vaccination. In other words, our results indicate that there are fewer people against vaccination in the case of COVID-19. Additionally, we found that perception of government performance in managing the pandemic also influences the WTP. This variable had not been considered in previous studies related to vaccine evaluation, such as those carried out by [3, 4, 7] . This is an important variable because the information provided by the government on the negative effects of COVID-19 and the strategies applied to mitigate the pandemic (such as restriction on mobility or quarantine), are key to educating the population and affect the WTP for the vaccine. In fact, there are studies that indicate that education, information and communication can improve the willingness to vaccinate against respiratory viruses [23] . Therefore, it is important that the government executes credible measures, informs and educates clearly about the impact that SARS-CoV-2 contagion generates. It should be noted that the results of this study would be important to consider if the vaccine were to be introduced in a different country in the future, as they provide information to target available economic resources and many countries have budgetary constraints to deal with the SARS-CoV-2 health emergency. The results are applicable to countries that have mixed health systems (public and private provision) and that are based on copayments, such as some countries in North America and Europe. In addition, considering that income is one of the important factors for the WTP for a vaccine, it is proposed that the government or the authorities in charge of public health carry out free COVID-19 vaccination campaigns, especially for people with lower incomes, leaving private provision to households with higher incomes. This last strategy is endorsed by the literature [24] . In this study, we found a high social and individual valuation for a COVID-19 vaccine. The average value to pay per individual was US$184.72, considering a discrete choice model in double dichotomous format, which implied a social valuation of approximately US$2,223 million. The variables that positively impacted the WTP were the pre-existence of chronic diseases, knowledge of COVID-19, being sick with COVID-19, perception of government performance, employment status, and income. The variables that negatively affected the WTP were belonging to a private health system, non-adaptation to working from home with children (due to quarantine) and having recovered from COVID-19. These latter variables could be used to define strategies for public health policy intervention to confront the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, if the vaccine will become a ""public good"" globally, there would still be costs associated with production and distribution, and the laboratory that develops it should be financially compensated. Therefore, the WTP results from this study can serve as a compensation benchmark for vaccine developers. ","72 under the most accurate estimation technique and with a reliability level of 99.9%.

Doctors, nurses, dentists, and other health care workers are concerned about contagion, not only for themselves, but also for their families and colleagues. Furthermore, the oral mucosa has been accepted as a high-risk route of transmission for COVID-19. In many countries, dentists have been forced to stop working during quarantine until further notification. Isolation and its financial impact have produced physical and psychological pressure, depression, social anxiety, and other mental health concerns.

165050,"Data from a large sample of users of a national DMHS reveals a significant early psychological impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Australian community. There have been large increases in website visits, and number and duration of calls to the clinic when compared to a comparison period. Overall numbers of patients accessing online assessment services did not increase during this early stage but have subsequently significantly increased. There are several possible reasons for the increased demand for MindSpot services, including increased distress levels in the population, the temporary closure of existing face-to-face services, and increased promotion of MindSpot by other services that were unable to meet patients needs. Patients using MindSpot during this early pandemic period reported a broad range of concerns, including greater anxiety, but also concerns about issues such as where to access COVID-19 tests, financial insecurity, and how to adjust to isolation and other changes in lifestyle, including having children at home, being unable to visit family members and friends, and advice about supporting people in isolation. Many of these challenges involve themes of loss and adjustment, but also reflect exacerbation of existing tensions within families or workplaces. While most users acknowledged concern about COVID-19, there was only a small but We found that older adults, who are typically more stoical in their rating of mood symptoms, had higher levels of concern than younger adults. Anecdotally, our therapists reported that people contacting the service who are themselves health workers or are in other front-line services dealing with the public are often highly anxious about their own health, which is also understandable given the alarming reports of deaths among frontline doctors and nurses elsewhere (Fusalori, 2020). The study was conducted early in the pandemic in Australia before the health effects have been widely felt. We have not yet detected increased alcohol abuse, domestic violence and other manifestations of familial discord, or anxiety of senior school students and university students about their future prospects from protracted closure of colleges and cancellation of exams. We also did not find an increase in patients reporting suicidal thoughts or plans, as might have been expected. However, given the current predictions of the need for long term reduction in social contact to slow the spread of infection, those concerns may emerge in time. The current study provides evidence of behavioural changes and mental health concerns in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Limitations include the use of a comparison group from a period six months past. However, the period of September 2019 was selected following analyses indicating it represented the ""usual"" patient profile (Titov et al., 2020 submitted for publication), and avoided the period immediately prior to March 2020 during which Australia experienced a severe bushfire crisis that disrupted the summer holiday period and affected the major cities. It is possible that the demographics and symptoms of the comparison and COVID-19 groups reported here differ for reasons J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f unrelated to the COVID-19 crisis, although given the remarkably consistent characteristics of MindSpot users we believe that to be unlikely.

165130,"Early detection of viral outbreaks is essential to ensuring available resources for notification and isolation of cases, contact tracing, and quarantine. We find that monthly testing of 100% of the campus community is required to detect an outbreak when there are less than 9 or fewer detectable cases in the community, unless at least 30% of infected people develop symptoms that lead them to be tested HS. Even for the latter case, detection of outbreak when there are 9 or fewer detectable cases requires that 75% of the population be tested. As the percent tested declines, the size of the detectable populations increases fairly rapidly as testing levels decrease if the proportion of infected people is only 1 or 5%. But the increase is much slower if 30% or 60% do so; hence, monitoring of the university population for COVID-19 symptoms should be encouraged-especially if it is not feasible to implement high levels of testing. Our study is the first to examine what NAT testing rates are required to detect a SARS-CoV-2 outbreak at an early stage. Other studies have examined what testing and isolation is required to prevent an outbreak or reduce the reproduction number to below 1, indicating that to   ()   .   prevent an outbreak with testing and case isolation alone testing of the entire population twice weekly is required [2] . Importantly, our analysis does not examine what is required to curtail the outbreak, only what is required to detect it at an early stage. At this point, epidemiological measures including contact tracing and isolation of infected and exposed individuals might be able terminate the spread of this particular viral introduction within the community-but investigation of the conditions under which this can be achieved is warranted. Previous mathematical models indicate that contact tracing and isolation of symptomatic contacts would likely require a very high rate of contacts traced in order to reduce the reproduction number to below 1, and could still result in very large outbreak sizes [3] . However, this same study indicates that contact tracing efficacy could be lower if initial outbreak sizes are smaller, supporting efforts to identify outbreaks at an earlier stage. Additionally, we did not examine the impact of isolation of asymptomatic contacts which is possible in a university setting and could provide additional risk mitigation benefit. Further, social distancing interventions could be implemented after the point of outbreak detection which could further reduce transmission [4] . Early SARS-CoV-2 outbreak detection is achievable with high rates of NAT testing (100%/month) or possibly with lower rates of testing but a high proportion of infected people-even those with mild symptoms--presenting at HS for testing. Testing needs to be combined with   ()   . ()    ","Early detection of viral outbreaks is essential to ensuring available resources for notification and isolation of cases, contact tracing, and quarantine.<q>We find that monthly testing of 100% of the campus community is required to detect an outbreak when there are less than 9 or fewer detectable cases in the community, unless at least 30% of infected people develop symptoms that lead them to be tested HS.<q>But the increase is much slower if 30% or 60% do so; hence, monitoring of the university population for COVID-19 symptoms should be encouraged-especially if it is not feasible to implement high levels of testing.

It has become a pandemic in early 2020. The disease appears less devastating in children and adolescents. However, stress, quarantine and eventually mourning have major impacts on development. It is difficult to describe what this pandemic implies for a child psychiatrist, other than by giving a first-hand account. I propose to go through the main ethical questions that have arisen; to describe how my hospital team has reorganized itself to meet the new demands and questions, in particular by opening a unit dedicated to people with autism and challenging behaviors affected by COVID-19; and to address, in a context of national discussion, how the discipline has sought to understand the conditions of a certain well-being during quarantine. Finally, I will try to conclude with more speculative reflections on re-opening.","It has become a pandemic in early 2020.<q>The disease appears less devastating in children and adolescents.<q>Résumé Le COVID-19 est une maladie multi-organes liée à une infection par le virus SARS-CoV2 qui est devenue une pandémie au début de l’année 2020.

165501,"Serial interval, incubation interval, and basic reproduction number are important parameters to show the shape and form of the epidemic curve. The results of this study showed that the mean and median of SI for COVID-19 were 5.71, 4.75 days, respectively. As far as we know, this is the first report on serial interval from Iran, one of top 10 countries with highest number of reported cases of COVID-19. A study showed that the mean of serial interval in 468 confirmed Chinese cases (with 59 infector-infectee pairs) was 3.96 days [8] . Other studies estimated the mean of SI to be 4.6 [9] and 4.2 [10] in Japan and china, respectively. Also, a systematic review study by Minah Park et al. indicated the serial interval for COVID-19 to be 4-8 days [11] . Generally, different studies suggest that the serial interval is shorter than the incubation period for COVID-19. This may be indication of pre-symptomatic transmission; and therefore, further attention should be centered on preventive efforts. In fact, the present study showed that the serial interval for COVID-19 in western part of Iran was longer compared the other reports from elsewhere. This may be due to preventive interventions, training, and better mitigation policies in Iran, which has limited the transfer of person to person. Of course, SI can change over time, space and situation [6] . In fact, the serial interval for COVID-19 was shorter than that of SARS-CoV and longer than that of the influenza which was consistent with results of the other studies conducted in this area [12, 13] . Different studies have shown that the serial interval for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are 8.4 and 8-13 days, respectively [14, 15] . Such characteristics contribute to more rapid transmission of Covid19 than the other coronaviruses; therefore, contact tracing must compete against the rapid replacement of case generations [11] . In addition, the reproductive number for COVID-19 was lower than what was found in the other studies. Given that the serial interval is important factor in calculating the reproduction number and considering the fact that our study showed longer serial interval, the rate of spreading in this disease is slower and, therefore, the reproductive number will be lower as well [10] . WHO has estimated the ranged of COVID-19 R 0 to be 1.4 to 2.5; however, some studies have calculated this number to be higher and, consequently, the pace of spread to be faster. For instance, a review study found the average R 0 to be 3.2 [6] ; whereas, another study reported this number to be 2.28 [16] . It seems the estimation of reproductive number is highly dependent on the used methods. Plus, one of the reasons behind this difference might be different time-periods in which the estimation have been taking place. Needless to say, R 0 in early stages of epidemic is higher than in the following stages. One of the strengths of this study is that time-frames are included in the estimation of R 0 s. All in all, it can be concluded that the low reproduction number for COVID-19 in Kermanshah province is an indication of the effectiveness of preventive and interventive programs such as quarantine and isolation. Consequently, continuing these preventive measures are highly recommended.

165816,"We present here a study of the awareness of SARS-CoV-2 among healthcare professionals and the general public with a comparison of many features among them. It is heartening to note that the knowledge with respect to SARS-CoV-2 is relatively high among the respondents. There are, however, various limitations of the study and these are inherent due to the circumstances in which this survey was done. The study was begun on March 23, 2020, one day after Janata Curfew in India as requested by the Prime Minister and one day before the lockdown on March 24, 2020 [7] . The survey was filled during the days of the lockdown when the respondents had a lot of time on their hands and were probably active on social media as well as watching the television news. Hence, it is quite relevant that many individuals have their information from these two sources, making it important to ensure that accurate information through verified channels and healthcare professionals are presented and broadcasted to the people. This also points towards the importance of the right people being active on social media so that they can communicate the scientifically validated information to the masses. The curfew and the lockdown ensured that the seriousness of the disease was impressed upon by the highest offices in the country, which is reflected in people taking good precautionary measures to protect themselves from the disease as well as break the chain of transmission. The cases in India have hence not risen to a very high number as rapidly as expected/projected, which also probably indicates that the message was well conveyed and well perceived. As this is a survey that was filled remotely, we need to be cautious in drawing strong conclusions. Another limitation of the study is that the questionnaire was in the form of google forms and the language of conduct was English. This implies that the people who did not have access to the internet and were not literate were unable to be a part of this survey. But as the source of information for all the general public remains similar (television is ubiquitous in India), we can infer that they would have a similar response. We base this inference as the main sources of information of the public at large were newspapers, television, and WhatsApp despite having access to websites and other online sources. In villages, often the literate readout regional newspapers and news received on mobiles to the rest of the family/friends to ensure dissemination of information. It is now known that the basic reproductive number (R0) of coronavirus is more in healthcare professionals as compared to the lay public and hence the relative indifference or ""no worries"" approach of healthcare professionals towards getting infected by SARS-CoV-2 is a concern. In the scenario where adequate personal protective equipment (PPE) may not be available to the healthcare facilities in India due to increased global demand, it is important that healthcare workers know their risk for being infected. In a recent study in Mumbai, 79% of the healthcare professionals were aware of the various PPE required with only 54.5% of them being aware of isolation procedures needed for SARS-CoV-2 infected patients [8] . The numbers for paramedical staff were also lower. India imports raw materials for PPE production from China and South Korea. Due to the shortage of materials and low rate of supply, the availability has taken a massive hit resulting in an acute shortage in the market. It is highly likely that many healthcare professionals will not use appropriate PPE, will get infected, and further spread infections to patients [9] [10] [11] . The Bhilwara cohort in Rajasthan is an example of how a healthcare professional needs to protect against infection since he/she is likely to transmit it to others [12] . Another example in Mumbai is Saifee hospital, which was shut down due to an infected healthcare professional who continued to work and passed on the infection to many during the asymptomatic phase. The SARS-CoV-2 disease presents a unique organism that can be spread for at least five days before developing symptoms and up to 37 days after presentation [13, 14] . Given its high infectivity, it is a recipe for disaster if healthcare personnel gets it. We have not collected demographic information from the participants and hence it is possible that many of them work in situations where they may not anticipate getting infected. The previous few months have shown how surgeons, orthopedicians, dentists, etc., who typically do not deal with infectious diseases are getting infected by coronavirus [15, 16] . In this scenario, it is worrying that only 80% of healthcare professionals were worried while the public was slightly more worried (82%). The difference in the source of information for healthcare professionals and the general public is stark when we compare information garnered through social media. Social media at 78.3% is the second-highest source for the general public, while the healthcare professionals give it a measly 1%. Since social media is prone to fake news, it is heartening that healthcare professionals are not learning from it. However, the reliance of the general public on social media indicates that healthcare professionals, professional organizations, and government officers need to invest a significant proportion of their time and resources to be active on social media to disseminate correct news. The shots heard round the world rapid-response network is an example that needs to be followed [17] . In another example, we have Dr. Roberto Burioni who has successfully given accurate data on social media. If more healthcare professionals were to enrich social media, it would be a useful platform for the public [18, 19] . While many government officials are active on Twitter in India, the platform that is commonly used in India is WhatsApp, Telegram, Instagram, and TikTok and these are dynamic and keep changing. WhatsApp in the middle of this pandemic reduced the forwarding to just one person for a message that had been forwarded five times from the previous number of forwarding to five people (which was unlimited initially) [20] . It indicates the importance of this platform across the world for the spreading of messages. The healthcare professionals rated scientific journals at just about 40.9%. It may be due to the low availability of high-quality evidence or poor access that many healthcare professionals in India have to scientific journals, which are mostly published out of developed countries [21] . In a pandemic situation, this disparity in access can be catastrophic and hence most journals have provided open access to all coronavirus-related publications. Healthcare professionals accessed websites such as WHO, Medscape, MOHFW, CDC, Worldometers, covid19.com, ICMR, UpToDate, and PubMed, for reliable information, which is an indicator of their faith in health organizations across the world. Interestingly though at a low 29.3%, much of the general public accessed similar websites such as WHO, MOHFW, CDC, and ICMR. At the time that the survey was administered, online webinars via zoom or other applications were just beginning in India to educate clinicians searching for answers. This is not reflected in our current study due to many of the responses being filled before the same or the respondents not being part of these audiences. The study authors have attended many of these meetings conducted by the Indian Academy of Pediatrics, etc., and this information is made available via email or WhatsApp messages. In a changing world, both healthcare professionals and the general public need to have reliable and accurate sources of information. The severity of illness was well identified by all who were surveyed as being difficulty in breathing. Another heartening aspect was that precautionary measures were well known to both the groups of participants with appropriate hand washing techniques, avoidance of public gatherings, and covering of the mouth while coughing and sneezing as the top three precautionary measures. During the first week of March in India, all the telephone and cellular caller tunes were changed to advisories of how to prevent coronavirus disease and when to seek medical help, which included the above messages apart from appeals on television, etc [22] . There was less knowledge related to treatment and vaccine among both healthcare professionals and the general public, which was a disappointing finding for healthcare professionals as they were expected to be aware of this. The same could be said of the knowledge of the infectivity period and duration of being asymptomatic after infection. There was a good knowledge of the usage of masks among the general public and healthcare professionals except for the usage of medical masks for healthy people to protect themselves. The ICMR and other bodies have issued guidelines on the usage of masks and this seems to have been disseminated widely [23] . There was also a low insistence on the need for testing those without respiratory difficulty. In a scenario where testing resources are limited, this is an appropriate response but since it is possible to have the infection without respiratory difficulty, especially early on, this disinterest in getting tested, especially in healthcare personnel is worrisome when there is enough evidence of spread from asymptomatic and mildly symptomatic persons. It is also likely that this response may be due to the fact during the time that this questionnaire was administered, the total cases rose from 400+ to about 800+ and the testing strategy of ICMR was limited to those with contact or travel to SARS-CoV-2-affected areas [24] . Since writing this manuscript, except for a single source event of a religious gathering in Delhi, which caused the doubling of cases to increase from about seven days to 4.1 days, it is reasonable to conclude that adequate knowledge exists among the general public. We can only hope that this would be enough to ensure that lockdown to reduce transmission and flatten the curve will be successful [25] [26] [27] [28] . The COVID-19 pandemic has affected the world in various ways. The deficiency of information, the need for accurate information, and the rapidity of its dissemination are important, as this pandemic requires the cooperation of entire populations. The rapid survey that we conducted had a good response and we show that healthcare professionals and the general public were quite well informed about the coronavirus. They are aware of the measures needed to be taken to reduce the spread of the disease. The knowledge present allows the authors to speculate that the lockdown in India would be effective. The public receives a large amount of information from social media such as WhatsApp and the medical fraternity and government need to develop strategies to ensure that accurate information needs to spread in these fora. The public awareness is quite high and it is important that the knowledge of communication channels be known and be kept at the topmost priority throughout the pandemic. The following is part of the text of the approval letter indicating approval for the study.

The intervention reduces more than 70% of new infections in both households and the public space, as well as the deaths caused by COVID-19 pneumonia. Household transmission is the dominant route of disease spread regardless of quarantine. This will provide important evidence and scientific insights to other worldwide countries that are currently under quarantine.","Abstract Hubei province in China has completed cycle of quarantine-resumption in 23rd Janauary and 8th April 2020, providing a unique opportunity as for now to assess its intervention impact and the pattern of SARS-COV-2 transmission during the quarantine period.<q>The intervention reduces more than 70% of new infections in both households and the public space, as well as the deaths caused by COVID-19 pneumonia.<q>Household transmission is the dominant route of disease spread regardless of quarantine.

167353,"The major finding of this study was that containment of SARS-CoV-2 among HCWs is feasible if vigilance is maintained through ongoing surveillance, and mitigating measures are triggered early upon the detection of a potential cluster. During an ongoing outbreak of SARS-CoV-2, our institution successfully detected and contained a cluster of COVID-19 cases among HCWs, preventing transmission to other HCWs and from Of these 49 staff, 10 had significant unprotected contact with both case 1 and case 2; 23 staff had significant unprotected contact with case 1 only; and 1 had significant unprotected contact with case 2 only. An additional 15 staff did not report significant unprotected contact, but because they shared an enclosed office space with case 1 (dotted line), they were deemed to be at higher risk of exposure and were also placed under quarantine. HCWs to patients. Early containment of the cluster also minimized the disruption to service. Although almost half of the medical social services department required isolation, our institution did not have to shut down its medical social services department for 2 weeks. We achieved this through an integrated strategy focused on surveillance for early case detection, outbreak investigation and containment, and encouraging compliance with measures for staff protection at the individual level. Individual-level compliance among HCWs is crucial as the first line of defense during an the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak. Symptom monitoring, early evaluation at the staff clinic, and staying home if unwell were all crucial parts of our institution's strategy. Indeed, given that persons with COVID-19 can remain contagious even when minimally symptomatic, the risk that HCWs with mild and nonspecific symptoms can serve as a vector of intrahospital disease spread is real, and even 1 infected HCW returning to work has the potential to cause a nosocomial outbreak with devastating consequences. 16 At our institution, all HCWs with COVID-19 presented with relatively mild upper respiratory tract infection; none presented with pneumonia. Monitoring fever alone is unlikely to be sufficient given that most COVID-19 cases were afebrile, unlike SARS cases, for which temperature monitoring was key. 17 In our investigation of the MSW cluster, compliance to our institution's policy of mandatory 5-day medical leave was likely crucial in reducing the potential number of exposed individuals to case 1 when she was most infectious. Emerging data suggest that the viral load in respiratory samples from COVID-19 patients peaks within the first few days after symptom onset before declining. 18 Addressing presenteeism is critical to ensuring the functionality of staff surveillance in detecting a cluster of COVID-19 among HCWs at an early stage, 2 and mitigating transmission. Upon subsequent investigation of the MSW cluster, a large number of HCWs reported mild ARI symptoms but had not sought medical evaluation; hence syndromic surveillance was unable to detect the cluster in real time. During an ongoing outbreak, HCWs may experience anxiety when reporting absence from work due to illness 2 or perceive an obligation to work, 19 resulting in the phenomenon of ""presenteeism,"" or work attendance despite illness. 20, 21 Mildness of symptoms is a key factor associated with presenteeism; 22 this is especially relevant with COVID-19, given mild infection in most individuals. 13 Institutional policies should encourage work from home (eg, enhancing teleconferencing and telemedicine capabilities) and should not disincentivize individuals from going on medical leave. In our institution, during the outbreak, medical leave for staff with respiratory syndromes was recorded as hospitalization leave, which has a higher annual entitlement than outpatient sick leave. During a 16-week period of staff surveillance, we detected 14 cases of COVID-19 among HCWs on our campus. Reflecting ongoing community transmission during the prevailing period, 14 most cases acquired infection from the community or from travel; we detected HCW-HCW spread in only 1 case. The COVID-19 situation was unlike our healthcare system's previous experience with SARS, in which spread was largely nosocomial. 17 Although the use of PPE may have helped to prevent patient-HCW transmission, staff surveillance must be vigilant for intrahospital spread occurring outside the usual ward setting, such as office areas and rest areas where HCWs can mingle. Contact among HCWs was shown to be largely assortative in nature; a local study showed that HCWs reported contact with other HCWs of the same type as the next most frequent class of contact after patients. 23 Thus, initial infections may be concentrated among HCWs of the same type after its introduction into a given setting by an infectious HCW, as occurred in our first staff cluster among MSWs. Given that all HCWs are potentially at risk during a period of ongoing community transmission, surveillance needs to be extended to all staff, not just HCWs who are predominantly ward based (eg, doctors and nurses). This surveillance is especially crucial, given that the potential of transmission from HCWs to patients by allied health professionals should not be underestimated. In local studies, allied health professionals had both the longest cumulative contact time and longest contact episode duration with patients. 23 All HCW strategies need to include nonclinical and ancillary staff to ensure adequate business continuity for hospitals during a pandemic. 24 Our detection of HCW clusters in which transmission likely occurred outside work highlights the importance of practicing social distancing outside the work setting. Our study has several limitations. In our hospital, PCR testing for SARS-CoV-2 was utilized as a diagnostic modality for COVID-19. However, given that the diagnostic yield of PCR testing for SARS-CoV-2 would likely be dependent on the quality and type of respiratory tract sample, similar to results of testing for other coronaviruses, 25 COVID-19 cases may have been missed due to sampling issues. The follow-up of potentially exposed HCWs to test for seroconversion and further epidemiological studies using serological tests, when such tests are developed, would be useful. Our results also reflect the experience of a healthcare institution in a SARS-CoV-2 outbreak during which the prevailing national strategy was one of containment. 8 Exhaustive testing, surveillance, and isolation of potentially exposed HCWs may not be feasible in a healthcare system that is overwhelmed. 16 However, staff surveillance is a crucial component of outbreak control during the containment phase to reduce the likelihood of nosocomial transmission and to sustain confidence and morale in the healthcare system. 2, 19, 24 In conclusion, during an ongoing outbreak of COVID-19, our institution successfully detected and contained a cluster of COVID-19 infection among HCWs. This was achieved through an integrated strategy focused on surveillance of ARI symptoms for early case detection, outbreak management, and encouraging compliance at the individual level. Given that most patients with COVID-19 have mild symptoms, addressing presenteeism is crucial to minimizing the number of potentially exposed staff and patients. With ongoing local transmission, staff surveillance must focus on intrahospital spread in nonclinical areas where social mingling of HCWs can occur.
